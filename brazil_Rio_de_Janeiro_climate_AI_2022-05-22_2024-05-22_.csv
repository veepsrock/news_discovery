By Natalie Pierce, Head of Global Shapers Community, World Economic Forum
Every day, thousands of decisions about the future of our communities, countries and the planet are made. Too often, young people are excluded from these decisions. Young people are given limited voice to shape the world resulting in a crisis of youth mistrust in others and the future.
Vanished is the promise that each generation will be better off than the one before. Instead, young people inherit a world where climate change nears the point of no return; pollution levels reach fatal highs, complex wars show no end in sight and inequalities within societies everywhere skyrocket.
A different approach is crucial to challenge the status quo and deliver the breakthrough solutions our world needs. It is time for all stakeholders and generations to join forces and tackle pressing challenges together. The first step is ensuring young people are meaningfully included in decision-making.
At Davos 2024, this years Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, the World Economic Forum will use its platform to empower 50 young innovators and activists to advocate for the solutions we need to repair trust in the future and between generations. These changemakers are from diverse cities, countries and walks of life and will bring tangible solutions and inspiring calls for action to world leaders in Davos. What is on their agenda? Young changemakers explain.
Advancing bold actions to protect the planet
Two of the greatest crises of our time are the biodiversity and climate crises. If world leaders want to repair trust with the next generation, they must rapidly reduce emissions, honour their financial commitments and achieve a just transition towards clean energy that creates millions of jobs.
Ann Dumaliang is a young conservationist fighting to protect pinnacle karst formations in Baras, Rizal, Philippines. She is the co-founder and managing trustee of the Masungi Georeserve and as she sees it:
Governments, industries and businesses have the power, technology and resources to reshape the future. To do so, they must assess the true cost of doing business and acknowledge the disproportionate impacts of their actions on future generations. They must act with empathy, accountability and urgency to invest in nature-based solutions, implement science-backed policies and protect at least 30% of the planets land and water by 2023.
Ahmed Slim Bouakez, an ecopreneur harnessing innovation to advance water conversation in Tunisia, adds: Transparency plays an instrumental role in rebuilding trust and cooperation regarding the climate emergency. Lack of transparency in land and water management leads to inefficient allocation of resources. When it comes to our resources, we must treat data as a shared asset to pave the way for collaborative solutions and mitigate the risk of conflicts.
Dumaliang and Bouakez join other climate activists under the age of 30 in Davos, including Ineza Umuhoza, coordinator of the Loss and Damage Youth Coalition in Rwanda, Rita Steele, the founder of the BIPOC Sustainability Collective in Canada, Salma Mohammadiyan, an ecopreneur expanding circular innovation in Mexico, and João Rocha, an engineer who helped incite the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to declare a climate emergency.
Ensuring digital technology is an enabler and equalizer
Advances in technology have left no aspect of life untouched. The Fourth Industrial Revolution has fostered innovation, accelerated progress and connected the world in unimaginable ways. Yet we face a colossal digital divide, unprecedented risks related to misinformation, manipulation and surveillance, and pressing ethical, safety and regulatory questions. Young people know that the challenges of emerging technologies need to be tackled head-on and want to be a part of the solution-building process.
According to Kathy Liu, Digital Sovereignty Development Manager at Amazon in the United Kingdom, Developing digital literacy, sharing data openly and safeguarding online security must be top priorities if decision-makers want to rebuild trust with the next generation in 2024.
Young people want an open, free and secure digital future, where all people are connected to the Internet by 2030, and where underrepresented groups including women, minorities and youth have an equal role in designing, developing and governing new technologies.
Liu is one inspiring young innovator attending Davos 2024. Others include Antonella Di Ciano, who is using artificial intelligence (AI) to combat environmental crime in Venezuela; Guilherme de Rosso Manços, Head of Innovation at the largest paediatric hospital in Brazil; René Bucken, a young journalist using emerging technologies to combat fake news in Germany; and Marek Miltner, an engineer applying AI tools to solve climate challenges in the Czech Republic.
Restoring intergenerational trust will not materialize within the confines of corporate boardrooms or the corridors of power. It demands tangible actions to dismantle age barriers in politics and business and systemically integrate young people into decision-making spaces at all levels,"" says Miltner.
He adds, ""This means guaranteeing that diverse perspectives shape policies and products and endorsing and adequately funding youth-led initiatives for progress. Elevating young people to advisory boards is also paramount, for who else could better advise on the future than those destined to inherit it?
Realizing the promise of economic progress
Over the past decade, two significant crises a global recession and a pandemic have hindered the economic outlook of young people. That has stalled the ability of millions of young people to access decent jobs, skills and housing and has resulted in a sharp increase in youth unemployment.
According to recent data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, young people are two and a half times more likely to be unemployed than other age cohorts. They are also more likely to work in insecure jobs and face higher risks of living in extreme poverty. Current risks such as climate change and rising displacement will worsen these trends.
Hashim Alsharif Alzaabi is an entrepreneur accelerating re-skilling in the United Arab Emirates. He suggests, A key to rebuilding trust in talent and job markets is fostering a culture of continuous learning and adaptability, ensuring young people are not merely prepared for todays jobs but equipped with the necessary skills to thrive in the ever-evolving landscape of tomorrow. We must acknowledge technologys transformative power, re-evaluate traditional educations role and embrace targeted, high-quality learning approaches to increase youth employability worldwide.
Like Alzaabi many changemakers in Davos will focus their advocacy on expanding economic access and job opportunities for the next generation. Deveney Smith is transforming leadership pipelines for BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and people of colour) talent in Washington DC in the United States, Olajumoke Adekeye is bridging the 21st century skills gap to accelerate youth employment in Nigeria, and Islam Iqbal is a young leader whose decade-long work uplifted thousands of Afghan youth through. education opportunities, including a large number of women leaders.
As Iqbal outlines, In conflicts, next to existential threats, young people face challenges in accessing employment, education and healthcare. Yet, the skillset they bring most often are unique. To leave no one behind, young migrants, refugees and internally displaced people must be provided opportunities to recraft their lives with dignity, contribute to the economy and have the chance to lift up others left behind. We must stand united in our call for peace, security and the full protection of youth in conflict zones.
Iqbal left Afghanistan hours before the Taliban takeover and has relocated to Canada. He remains committed to amproving access to opportunities for education, employment and employability of Afghan refugees worldwide.
Ensuring inclusive governance and cooperation
Young people remain nearly invisible when it comes to participation in public decision-making. Despite half of the worlds population being under 30, only 2.6% of parliamentarians globally fall within this age group. Young people want decision-making bodies to represent the diversity of the people they seek to serve and commit to inclusive, citizen-centred policy design.
Reed Shafer-Ray is the founder and CEO of Mountaintop, a non-profit building community self-reliance and strengthening local institutions. Reed advocates that We must reserve government and board seats for youth. Gender quota laws in 132 countries improved government responsiveness to female citizens, increased the educational outcomes of girls and fuelled investments in public goods favoured by women. Similarly, youth parliamentary quotas have been implemented in nine African and Asian countries. Without such reservations, qualified young leaders will struggle to compete. We must experiment and refine youth quotas to empower the next generation and achieve better outcomes for all.
Lynn Malkawi founded Wasel, a social enterprise strengthening civic education in Jordan. She adds, If we are to rebuild trust, governments must use technology to engage youth on the issues that matter to them most. Young people must be informed of national strategies and leaders must foster democracy, be transparent about trade-offs and build systems of accountability. Youth want open governance with information shared willingly and proactively.
According to Malkawi, This will help to create a culture of collaboration and innovation, and if matched with concrete action, societies can increase civic engagement and restore trust in government.
Todays biggest challenges call for the diverse perspectives, innovative thinking and commitment that impassioned young minds bring. Organizations have access to resources that can unlock this potential at a time when young people and our future need it most.

 Spanning more than eight million square kilometers (3.1 million square miles), Amazonia is home to the worlds largest tropical rainforest. It is also the front line of environmental crimes, including land grabbing and illegal gold mining, as well as extractive industries such as logging, ranching, and soy production. Owing to these activities, large swaths of the region are approaching an irreversible tipping point that could turn rainforest into savannah. Despite recent reductions in forest clearance, deforestation and severe land degradation have already affected 26% of the region, putting more than 10,000 plant and animal species at risk of extinction. 
 If illegal deforestation and the extractivist development model persist, the World Resources Institute warns, the regions 2050 carbon emissions will be five times higher than the threshold set by the Paris climate agreement. A staggering 57 million hectares of forest an area the size of France could be destroyed, with dire consequences for the climate, biodiversity, ocean currents, and global food supplies. 
 A sure way to slow and reverse all forms of deforestation and land degradation is to increase the economic value of standing forests. We need improved security and market incentives the ability to profit from protecting nature to promote decarbonization and conservation. To that end, one especially promising model is the bioeconomy, which comprises regenerative agriculture, livestock, and fishing; sustainable timber and non-timber cultivation; green- and renewable-energy production; sustainable biomaterials (including pesticides, fertilizers, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals); eco-tourism and related services; sustainable fashion and textiles; and services based on carbon capture and biological and environmental conservation. 
 Enthusiasm for the bioeconomy is growing, especially in the Amazon Basin. A Pan-Amazonian Conference on Bioeconomy in Belem, Brazil, this past June brought together hundreds of experts from more than 100 organizations across the region. This is not just feel-good environmentalism; the potential economic returns are considerable. By some estimates, fully implementing a bioeconomy approach would enable Brazil to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 550 million tons and generate $284 billion per year by 2050. 
 Aside from a few enlightened businesses, however, there is still resistance from the extractive sectors, which see little to gain from such a shift. The institutional scaffolding of the Amazon bioeconomy is only just being erected. Scaling it up will require sustained, high-quality research and development, widely available infrastructure and capital, and new, resilient supply chains. Safeguards to protect the intellectual property of bioproducts and genetic resources are essential, as are strategies for respectful knowledge sharing with indigenous communities.

An urgent task is to clarify what the bioeconomy model does and does not entail. As matters stand, the eight countries that share the rainforest have competing interpretations, and the definitions being applied in the Amazon are often distinct from those promulgated by governments, businesses, and NGOs in North America and Western Europe. Determining what is included in the bioeconomy matters fundamentally, because it will shape the foundation of a green future. That is why we at the Igarapé Institute are partnering with the Inter-American Development Banks (IDB) Amazonia Forever program to expand the bioeconomy in a way that respects regional diversity. 
 The IDBs Amazonia Forever program is leading the charge in promoting and accelerating bioeconomy opportunities through financial support and technical assistance to local start-ups, bio-enterprises, and producers and harvesters at all levels of the value chain. Since fostering synergies between researchers, entrepreneurs, investors, producers, and communities in remote areas presents daunting logistical hurdles, the IDB and others are focusing on the high-value-added products that are needed to make the bioeconomy succeed. 
 Expanding this model requires stronger connections among bioeconomy scholars and researchers, which is why we have mapped several clusters of research communities working on related issues across the region. Some of the most advanced appear to be in Brazil and Colombia, where one generally finds robust, well-targeted bioeconomy policies and programs. Both countries have rapidly evolving productive sectors that are pursuing scientific and technological priorities, while also harnessing the valuable experiences and contributions of traditional communities. 
 In Ecuador and Peru, bioeconomy policies are less advanced despite many government-led efforts to promote bio-business and bio-innovation in certain sectors; Ecuador is in the process of developing a national bioeconomy policy. By contrast, Bolivia and Venezuela have resisted using the term bioeconomy (in favor of sustainable use of biodiversity), and remain more focused on smaller-scale initiatives to address food security and specific inputs like biofertilizers. Finally, in Guyana and Suriname, incipient low-carbon and green-economy strategies are confronting a powerful, entrenched fossil-fuel lobby. 
 Despite competing definitions, there are some shared principles. It is generally agreed that the bioeconomy includes activities that make use of biological resources and typically involve scientific and technological innovation, as well as insights and expertise from ancestral and traditional knowledge. Promoting value-added through processing and supply-chain efficiency is key, as are environmental services and the replacement of fossil-fuel-based products with sustainable alternatives. 
 Understanding how these bioeconomy approaches converge and diverge is critical for developing coherent policies and sustainable investment strategies. As long as conceptual asymmetries between local definitions and global guidelines go unrecognized, potential beneficiaries could miss out on funding opportunities. Ultimately, the environmental and social impact of bioeconomy-related investments will depend on the extent to which they genuinely address a countrys specific needs, priorities, and capacities. If bioeconomy initiatives are to be amplified, they will need patient capital and buy-in from a wide range of stakeholders, both regionally and globally. 
 The shift from extractivist to ecological production models is not just a national strategic imperative. It is a matter of human survival. The bioeconomy has vast potential, but it faces stiff competition from environmental crime and legacy industries. By sustainably leveraging Amazonias rich biodiversity and promoting the rule of law, we can build a prosperous and sustainable future for the forest and its inhabitants, while also making major contributions to decarbonization. The first step is to build awareness of the economic dividends that nature is capable of paying.",,Project Syndicate

Wests very public bouts of hate speech have cost him his billionaire status, as youll read below, because German sports brand Adidas chose to cut ties. It doesnt stop there he was dropped from his talent agency, temporarily lost the ability to post on both Instagram and Twitter, was escorted out of Skechers corporate office after an unsolicited visit and has been edited out of interviews and TV segments.
Some perceive Yes very public controversy as a shift in the way companies do business with stars. Although celebrity endorsements and partnerships used to be somewhat of a no-brainer for consumer brands, now, added layers of foresight are likely to be applied when moving into deals with a public figure. Fame is frequently coupled with notoriety these days, and a celebrity endorsement no longer guarantees a pay day for brands; many anticipate that companies will tread far more lightly when entering partnerships with potentially troublesome albeit sensational celebs. 
Clearly, there are some valuable business lessons embedded into this controversy. Today, success is often characterized by consumers as profitability, quality and responsibility. While there are some things even the most heedful forethought cant predict, if you want to do whats best for your brand, think deeply and critically about your collaborations.
Billionaire No More: Kanye Wests Antisemitism Obliterates His Net Worth As Adidas Cuts Ties
Kanye West. 
 Jamel Toppin For Forbes
Just days ago, the rapper-cum-fashion entrepreneur Kanye West challenged Adidas to drop him following a weeks-long barrage of antisemitic remarks made on social media and in national media appearances.
Ye, who had worked with Adidas since 2013 on his Yeezy line of super-expensive, super-popular sneakers, thought he was untouchable. After all, Adidas gets an estimated 4% to 8% of its sales from Yeezy products, according to investment bank Cowen. For Ye, it was an even bigger deal, accounting for $1.5 billion of his net worth.
But Yes words put the German athletic wear company, with its own Nazi ties dating back to its founders, in the hot seat. What followed was even more escalating pressure on Adidas to sever ties with Ye, as his string of antisemitic remarks drew condemnation from the top tiers of Hollywood. For weeks, Adidas stayed silent. 
This Tuesday, Adidas finally broke its silence and ended the relationship. That move will cost them big, but Ye even more, immediately knocking him out of the billionaire ranks.

Joshua Howat Berger,'Harvesting Data': Latin American AI Startups Transform Farming,"For centuries, farmers used almanacs to try to understand and predict weather patterns.",https://www.ibtimes.com/harvesting-data-latin-american-ai-startups-transform-farming-3730151,https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4522715/ceo-agrosmart-tech-based-agriculture-startup-mariana-vasconcelos-poses-after-interview-afp.jpg,2024-04-20T01:42:13Z,"For centuries, farmers used almanacs to try to understand and predict weather patterns.
Now, a new crop of Latin American startups is helping do that with artificial intelligence, promising a farming revolution in agricultural giants like Brazil, the world's biggest exporter of soybeans, corn and beef.
Aline Oliveira Pezente, a 39-year-old entrepreneur from the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, was working at agriculture company Louis Dreyfus Commodities when she noticed a problem in how the farming industry operates in Brazil.
Producers need huge amounts of credit up-front to buy inputs like seed and fertilizer, she says. But lenders are wary given how difficult it is to size up the myriad risks, from the natural -- droughts, floods, crop disease, erosion -- to the financial -- bankruptcy, price crashes and more.
In 2018, Aline and her husband Fabricio launched a startup called Traive that collects massive amounts of agriculture-related data, then analyzes it with AI, breaking down the capital risk for lenders and giving farmers easier access to credit.
""Lenders used to each use their own (risk analysis) model. Imagine like a giant Excel file,"" Aline told AFP. ""But it's very hard for humans, even those who are super knowledgeable of statistics and mathematics, to create equations that capture the nuances of all the variables.
""They were taking three months to do something that we can do in five minutes with way better accuracy,"" said Aline, who has a master's degree specializing in AI and data analysis from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Seven years on, Traive's clients include agro-industry giants like Syngenta, fintech firms and Latin America's second-biggest bank, Banco do Brasil. More than 70,000 producers use its platform, which has facilitated nearly $1 billion in financial operations, it says.
Aline presented her work this week at the Rio de Janeiro edition of Web Summit, the massive tech gathering dubbed ""Davos for Geeks.""
Speaking alongside her on a panel called ""Harvesting Data: The Next Agricultural Revolution,"" fellow entrepreneur Alejandro Mieses explained how AI has the potential to reshape farming.
Worldwide, farmers are increasingly turning to AI to boost yields and returns, with applications like self-driving tractors, drones that track crop health and smart cameras that recognize weeds for herbicide treatment.
Mieses's Puerto Rico-based startup, TerraFirma, developed an AI model that uses satellite images to forecast environmental risks like natural disasters, crop disease and erosion.
""We insist on the physics of it, because we believe that is the base point. Understanding how water moves, how wind moves, how different solar exposures operate throughout your farmland,"" he said at Web Summit, of which AFP is a media partner this year.
The hard part, the panelists said: AI models have to be trained on massive amounts of data.
Although farmers tend to be data-obsessed -- painstakingly tracking environmental conditions, inputs and productivity -- gathering and processing that information around the world is complex.
""It's quite resource-intensive. You need servers, you need an immense repository of data,"" said Mieses, 39.
""It's the same old story of garbage in, garbage out.""
The agriculture industry faces criticism in countries like Brazil, whose rise as an agricultural powerhouse has also seen a surge of environmental destruction in key regions like the Amazon rainforest, a vital resource against climate change.
Innovation optimists argue that, with the world's population expected to reach nearly 10 billion people by 2050, technologies like AI are humanity's best hope for surviving without destroying the planet.
Mariana Vasconcelos is the 32-year-old chief executive of Brazilian startup Agrosmart, which uses AI to help farmers manage climate risks and produce more sustainably.
""The UN Food and Agriculture Organization says we need to increase food production to feed a growing population. At the same time, we have to produce with less: less land, less deforestation, less carbon footprint. How can we do that without technology?"" she said.
""Agriculture is often seen as opposed to nature. But I think technology is showing that actually it can regenerate, restore the environment, work together with nature... Agriculture is headed for a more sustainable model.""

Tomorrow, April 30, is International Jazz Day, a world holiday for a jazz legend such as Herbie Hancock. And Hancock is treating it as such, hosting an international party to celebrate the music he has loved his whole life.
""Herbie Hancock will take viewers on an international tour of sights and sounds showcasing jazz in all its diversity. The concert will feature performances from Beijing, China; Beirut, Lebanon; Casablanca, Morocco; Johannesburg, South Africa; Marondera, Zimbabwe; Paris, France; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Vienna, Austria; and Fairbanks, Honolulu, New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC, USA,"" according to a press release.
The all-star concert, starting at four EST and one PST, will feature Sergio Mendes, Christian McBride, Dianne Reeves, Marcus Miller, Melody Gardot, Dee Dee Bridgewater and countless others. It will be live streamed on jazzday.com, unesco.org, hancockinstitute.org, the International Jazz Day YouTube and Facebook channels, and other outlets.
Hancock generously agreed to talk about his love of jazz, what jazz means to him and much more, including technology, AI, spirituality and much more for a fascinating conversation.
Steve Baltin: Since we're talking about International Jazz Day, what is jazz music to you? 
Herbie Hancock: Jazz is a music for anybody to be able to not only express themselves as individuals, but to express themselves within a collective of musicians. Yes, you can play solo but you can also play within a group. It allows you to compose over whatever the group has decided upon to be able to compose, so it's a conversation in a way, but an artistic conversation. And it's supportive of each of the individuals that's involved, even if you don't like them. But your responsibility automatically, because it's just built into the fiber of jazz, is to enhance what anybody does, even if you don't like what they played [chuckle]. You try to make everything fit, try to make everything be a piece of the puzzle, if you will. There's a lot more that I can explain. It's also about freedom, as I said, it's very democratic. Those are some of the hallmarks, I guess, of jazz, and it's fun to play.
Sage Bava: I'd love to hear the future of where you think this music is going with AI, but also our collective want in returning to realness, returning to real instruments. 
Hancock: Yeah, I think we're living in that time right now, where technology is advancing so much faster. And I'm a nerd. I loved technology ever since I was a child. Anyway, it is advancing further than I have ever expected in my whole life. And with that speed of advancement and the level of advancement, there are a lot of questions and issues at stake. Some of the horror movies that we've seen in the past, like Terminator, those things are not impossible anymore, so this is why we really need to figure out how to build a sense of ethics, like a humanitarian sense, something having to do with our sense of good and bad, distinguishing between the two because machines don't have that. That doesn't mean that they won't be able to have that included. But we have to be careful. We do have to beware of the possible dangers but the cat's out of the bag now and it can be such a boon to almost any field, but it's going to change the trajectory of what human beings do because they will impact a multitude of jobs and pursuits. But the best thing that we can do when it's available is to work with it, and maybe through that, AI can develop a sense of what the human spirit ultimately is. And so I think the future has a bright side, a very bright side. At the same time, sometimes you have to take the good with the bad. In Buddhism, I'm a Buddhist. And with SGI, that's the Buddhist organization I belong to, we believe in the value of not only the wonderful things, but there's value in the poisonous things too. We say ""Turning poison into medicine so that all of it winds up actually being helpful."" And that has to be applied to AI, that kind of sense. If we weren't able to turn poison into medicine, we would never learn anything. That's how we learned to walk, not only by studying what adults do in walking, but also by falling on our faces and scraping up our chins. But what are human beings? They get up and try it again, over and over again. I've learned a lot from criticism, that's something we can learn a lot from too. Anyway I could go on and on about this subject.
Baltin: Do you feel like you've enjoyed music more once you realized that its a byproduct of who you are as opposed to being just a musician? 
Hancock: I had already been enjoying music by that time, and, yes, it was enhanced by that realization, but it also pulled the blinders off of me to be able to explore other territories that came my way. And a lot of things that I'm working on personally now are not confined to the category of playing music or writing music. One of my main interests is technology, and we're talking about AI. I've been looking at a lot of YouTube videos about AI, and in a lot of different ways, but I'm also very concerned about the caveats. If introducing AI to the general public and having it being able to read everything that's online and absorb that, including social media, music [and] pretty much everything that human beings do. I'm concerned about people being replaced by machines. That's happened in the past. What happened to the people that used to make the shoes for horses? They were out of job, they had to take another job. Those kinds of situations have happened before but this is another level of that, and we have to be very careful about what those areas can be and the difficulties that are contained in those areas. Like just giving a person a living wage is not going to cause a person all of a sudden to just become happy. A lot of people love their jobs, a lot of people have been devoted to their jobs, and the idea of retraining them to some other kinds of pursuits still hasn't really been discussed that much within the governing bodies of America. So there are a lot of things that we're behind at getting to and there are a lot of things that have gotten in the way too. That is, our own greed gets in the way of us being able to deal with the realities of life. Look at climate change and how greed has slowed us down from being able to successfully deal with that problem. We've got to reach some benchmarks, and the slower we are at getting there, the more difficult it's going to be on the back end of it. I've got a grandson that I'm concerned about, what is his life going to be about? He's two years old now. What kind of planet are we leaving for him? There are so many things that need to be dealt with. We need to deal with the things that are built into our own constitution that was made back in the day when they had muskets. What are we doing with military gear in the hands of public, with children having rifles? We haven't dealt properly with the things that are right in front of our faces, be concerned, be concerned.
Baltin: What do you want people to take from Jazz Day? 
Hancock: I just want people to enjoy it, to be happy, they're hearing it, to be astounded and to not only brighten their day, but brighten their year and have them look forward to seeing and experiencing the joy of International Jazz Day every year. But another aspect of it is that it also contains musicians from all over the planet, and that one day, whether you are Chinese, Russian, Vietnamese, Thai, American, European, Brazilian, Turkish, whatever you may be, even though the governments may have been in agreement with everything or they may be even at war, on that one day with that music, we are functioning as a planet that works together because I think we have close to 195 countries that will be actually doing something on International Jazz Day pertaining to jazz. On this particular day, we got amazing people. Diane Reeves is going to be singing, Marcus Miller is performing on bass. Christian McBride is another bass player, Sérgio Mendes is doing something. Dee Dee Bridgewater, Melody Gardot, John Beasley, so many people are going to be doing it on the worldwide telecast and the webcast because we're not going to be able to show all of the performers in all the countries because it's so many countries. We have pages and pages of celebrations that will be happening throughout, take Italy, for example. They sent us pages and pages of data about how, throughout the country they will be celebrating International Jazz Day and the different performances and other activities that they'll have on that date pertaining to jazz. We've even had things in North Korea.
Bava: My favorite topic to discuss is spirituality and music, and I'm trying to do a deep dive on the subject. I'm curious if you have any favorite books, thinkers, researchers that you feel are really taking the baton in creating works around spirituality and music? 
Hancock: My life mentor is a man named Daisaku Ikeda, he's a Japanese man, he is the president, the mentor really of anybody who does this practice of Buddhism with Soka Gakkai International or SGI. He writes tons of books that are about Buddha, about the practice that we do and why we do it. If it brings you happiness, you would automatically want to share it with somebody else. And that actually is part of the practice, is let the other people know that it exists so that they can help themselves to move forward in life no matter how many things are trying to push them back. So actually, I would suggest going on the website. In America, it is SGI USA and seeing what's there, but as I said, it's practiced in other countries, so SGI will lead them to the website that's in that particular country.
Bava: What else do you want people to know about International Jazz Day?
Hancock: One thing is, I want to thank the Doris Duke Foundation being one of the funders for International Jazz Day and the Ford Foundation too, and also United Airlines, which is providing not only transportation, but they're also providing us with monetary funding too, so that's of course important to us. I needed to actually write some of these facts down. Each year, the International Jazz Day programs have reached more than 2 billion people worldwide through not just the performances. But also, we have education programs, we have community outreach programs, radio, television, streaming, and electronic print and social media, that's a lot of people. One more thing I just wanted to add, and that is, International Jazz Day is actually an activity that's really birthed by UNESCO and the UN. And the Herbie Hancock Institute of Jazz works in a partnership with the UN and UNESCO in creating and producing, International Jazz Day and all of its functions. The reason it's International Jazz Day is because it used to be that Americans were always just the best jazz musicians. Not so much anymore, now they have amazing jazz musicians all over the world. So when I became goodwill ambassador to UNESCO, the first thing I said was, ""The United States wants to give jazz to the world, although jazz was born in America, it now officially belongs to the world.""",,Forbes
Science X,"Women in tech, AI in focus as Web Summit opens in Rio","The future of artificial intelligence, technology to fight climate change and other glimpses at the cutting edge were in focus Tuesday as mega-tech conference Web Summit opened in Rio de Janeiro.",https://techxplore.com/news/2024-04-women-tech-ai-focus-web.html,https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2024/artificial-intelligenc-18.jpg,2024-04-16T17:30:48Z,"The future of artificial intelligence, technology to fight climate change and other glimpses at the cutting edge were in focus Tuesday as mega-tech conference Web Summit opened in Rio de Janeiro.
Known as the ""Davos for Geeks,"" the conference is holding its second edition in the Brazilian beach city, with more than 600 tech gurus, public personalities and other speakers joining entrepreneurs from more than 1,000 startups.
In a male-dominated industry, organizers said 45 percent of the startups represented this year were founded or are led by women, a record for Web Summit, which started in 2009.
Dozens of women tech entrepreneurs from countries including Argentina, Brazil, Portugal and Uruguay took the stage to applause as organizers opened the three-day event.
""Discussions at this year's event focus on technology's role in addressing crucial global issues, such as AI, fintech, climate change and human rights,"" said conference director Artur Pereira.
The gathering is ""an opportunity for Web Summit to convene technology's leaders in Latin America's already dynamic and rapidly growing tech scene"" and connect them with global players, he said.
Launched in Dublin 15 years ago, Web Summit moved to Lisbon in 2016. The Latin American edition is held in parallel with the original, which still convenes each November.
Organizers plan to hold the Rio edition at least through 2028. AFP is a media partner of the event this year.
The conference brings together startups with giants like IBM, BYD, Salesforce, Huawei and JP Morgan.
""Our mission is to transform Rio into the capital of innovation of Latin America,"" Rio Mayor Eduardo Paes said in his opening speech.
""We believe that tech and innovation can act as key drivers of Rio's economy.""
Rio officials say the event will draw 40,000 people a day and inject some 33 million reais ($6.4 million) into the economy.

The highlights this week: We dive deep into the regions economics, visiting a tech summit in Brazil, examining the U.S. sanctions snapback on Venezuela, and gaining insights from a father of the World Trade Organization.
Around 34,000 people from more than 100 countries descended on Rio de Janeiro this week for the second Web Summit Rio. The event, which highlights Latin Americas start-up scene, has quickly become the regions largest tech conference. Investors listened to new companies from Mexico to Chile pitch products and services. Last month, another start-up conference in the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre drew more than 23,000 people.
The high attendance reflects broad enthusiasm about Latin Americas start-up scene. It has come a long way in the last decade, said investor Rodrigo Baer of Upload Ventures, speaking at a Web Summit Rio session. When I started investing, we wanted to hire a marketing manager for [food delivery app] iFood and there wasnt one. Nobody had been a marketing manager for a start-up in 2012, he said.
Now, dozens of start-ups in the region have grown to be worth over a billion dollars each, in part driven by a boost during the COVID-19 pandemic. People became increasingly reliant on technology to work, access health care, and receive pandemic stimulus money. When central banks lowered interest rates to get the economy moving again in 2021, optimistic investors doled out record amounts of money to regional start-ups.
Now, investment levels are back down to pre-pandemic levels. But the start-up environment has matured, Buenos Aires-based venture capital investor Claire Díaz-Ortiz said at the summit. You see more early-stage funding happening than a couple of years ago, she said. New investor-led accelerator programs for founders include mentoring as well as financial support.
Latin Americas largest tech start-ups are concentrated in the financial sector, such as Brazils Nubank and Mexicos Bitso. Many people in the region lack conventional bank accounts but have smartphones. So-called fintechs have capitalized on this mismatch; in 2023, they continued to attract more money than any other start-up category, according to the Association for Private Capital Investment in Latin America.
Other start-up categories with high fundraising numbers reflect current economic trends, including logistics tech start-ups, which seek to take advantage of companies aiming to nearshore supply chains in Latin America. Representatives from Brazil-based cargo airline and logistics firm Modern Logistics were at the Rio conference, scouting out possible partners and vendors, and seeing how we can collaborate, CEO Cristiano Koga said. 
Climate tech companies have also attracted increased funding. Web Summit attendees included the founders of Vammo, an electric motorcycle service for delivery workers operating in São Paulo, and Órigo Energy, a Brazilian firm that offers discounts on electricity bills for customers who switch to solar power.
Artificial intelligence featured in many companies plans, too. Brazil- and U.S.-based start-up Traive uses algorithms that model the financial risk of agriculture firms based on more than 2,500 data inputs such as crop type, vehicle usage, and local climate. Its method was recently used to create sustainable bonds for deforestation-free soy from Brazils Cerrado region.
Start-ups have the potential to make Latin Americas business environment more competitive, and their ability to do so often depends on countries regulatory environments. But many start-ups are also shaping government regulations themselves.
Solar installation in Brazil has risen since Órigo Energy and its industry peers successfully pushed for rules on the sector. The change gave legal security and predictability for investments, CEO Surya Mendonça said. A large session at the summit was devoted to how G-20 countries can adopt policies that facilitate healthy environments for start-ups.
Argentinas representative to that session, tech entrepreneur Hanna Schiuma, said that some central banks in the region, such as in Colombia and Brazil, have supported the fintech landscape by running tests of regulations that could be appropriate for new types of financial products. Brazils work on digital innovation was applauded last month by the publication Central Banking, which named it Central Bank of the Year.
Schiuma acknowledged that the current economic uncertainty in Argentina had generally made business planning more difficult at the moment. The dust has not yet settled on President Javier Mileis sweeping economic policy overhaul. But taken as a whole, we are in a moment of clear growth of the start-up ecosystem in the region, she said.

Monday, April 22: The United Nations Security Council discusses Haiti.
Venezuela sanctions snapback. True to its warnings, the United States announced the reimposition of broad oil and gas sanctions on Venezuela on Wednesday after a six-month hiatus, citing Caracass failure to meet commitments on conditions for July presidential elections. U.S. officials cited bans on opposition candidates and their substitutes as sticking points.
U.S. oil firms will not face total restrictions on operating in the country, however. Chevron can still drill in Venezuela under permission that was granted separately from the October sanctions relief. The U.S. Treasury Department encouraged other oil companies to apply for similar permission.
Whether or not the temporary U.S. sanctions relief on Venezuela was successful depends on whom you ask. Advocates of a maximum pressure strategy argue sanctions should have never been retracted, while others point out that the negotiations that secured sanctions relief led to the release of U.S. and Venezuelan prisoners in the country and spurred the presidential primary process within Venezuelas opposition.
Haitis transition team. After weeks of haggling, Haiti has named a transitional government that includes representatives from civil society, several political parties, and the countrys interfaith religious community. The body was announced on Tuesday and has seven voting members and two nonvoting members. Acting Prime Minister Ariel Henry is expected to step down once the council is installed, although no date was immediately announced.
The difficulties Haiti faced identifying members of the transition team suggests another delay may be in store as they select a new prime minister. Were wishing them success, but this does not look like a clear path. It looks very murky, very uncertain, the Miami Heralds Caribbean correspondent, Jacqueline Charles, told FPs Ravi Agrawal in an interview last week.

Conservation mystery. As Venezuelas political future hangs in the balance, so, too, does the fate of its sea turtle populations. Over the past year, conservationists in La Sabana, a town on the countrys coast that is home to four of the seven sea turtle species on Earth, noticed that many of the reptiles were dying.
The conservationists were unable to discover the silent killer until Washington Post reporter Ana Vanessa Herrero began to research the problem. Herrero spoke to experts elsewhere in Venezuela who were studying an invasive species of ocean grass known as beach cabbage or sea lettuce. She relayed information about the plant to the conservationists in La Sabana, who have attempted to control its growth.
Venezuelan environmental officials have been informed about the invasive species and said they would work to eradicate it. But local activists said no work had begun as of early this month. After residents own beach cabbage management efforts, La Sabana is eagerly awaiting sea turtles who will again lay eggs on its shores, the Washington Post reports.

Latin American officials are in Washington this week for the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) spring meetings. Those bodies are weighing proposals to address debt pressure on poor countries and to increase climate finance on a global level. Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando Haddad on Wednesday led a call for a new tax on the super-rich to fund the green transition.
The meetings also weighed the IMFs latest predictions about the direction of the world economy. Although its worst fears of post-pandemic stagflation have not come to pass, the fund said global growth is still well below its potential. Many low-income countries remain debt-saddled, and ongoing wars could interrupt trade.
The IMF also said that geoeconomic fragmentation was stifling growth, a reference to trends that include Western efforts to put space between them and the Russian and Chinese economies. The fund noted that dividing the world into geoeconomic blocs could reduce capital and knowledge flows significantly and suppress growth, adding that multilateral cooperation is needed.
Beyond the IMF, veterans of the global trade system are more candidly sounding alarms. Current and former Latin American officials, including Haddad, have voiced wariness about geoeconomic clubs in recent months, both publicly and in private policy meetings.
[I]t is a misstep for the U.S., as a global leader, to restrict market openness and promote the onshoring of production, former Uruguayan central banker and former Inter-American Development Bank President Enrique Iglesias argued last month in an interview with a policy researcher that was shared with Foreign Policy.
Iglesias was a protagonist in talks that led to the founding of the World Trade Organization in the 1990s. It was a period of optimism about the rules for the global economy. [N]ow I wonder if it was too good to be true, he said.
This concept of friendshoring goes against capitalism, delving into ideological control. It appears as though the leading superpower is acting from a position of fear, almost akin to that of a smaller nation. What underpins this fear of competition within the United States?",,Foreign Policy

Among the highlights: the world premiere of Tilda Swinton’s feature directorial debut, The Hexagonal Hive and a Mouse in a Maze, co-directed by Bartek Dziadosz.
In the film, premiering in International Competition, Swinton and Dziadosz “travel the world to understand what it means to learn, and along the way uncover playful food for thought – for adults and young people alike.” Swinton previously directed segments in the documentaries The Seasons In Quincy: Four Portraits of John Berger (2016) and The New Ten Commandments (2008). 
Sheffield 2024 will not lack for star power. In addition to Oscar winner Swinton, Idris Elba and the team behind the upcoming National Geographic Documentary series Erased: WW2’s Heroes of Color will take part in a public talk. Elba narrates the episodic, which “sheds light on the immense contributions of over 8 million individuals who fought heroically for the Allied forces and whose stories have largely gone untold,” per NatGeo. Elba’s grandfather fought in WWII.
Actor Michael Sheen will record a live edition of the podcast The Last Witness, created by investigative journalists Dan Ashby and Lucy Taylor in collaboration with Sheen. It’s a true crime series involving an environmental horror story. BBC Radio 4 will begin airing the 10-parter on June 24.
“It’s hard to get your head around,” Sheen tells the BBC. “This story is about the first of the forever chemicals. And there are so many of them since then. We want people to understand what they are doing right now. There were moments in this story when a little voice inside my head was screaming.”
Three-time Oscar winner Walter Murch, the legendary sound and picture editor, will participate in a Master Class. As previously announced, Oscar winner Roger Ross Williams has been named this year’s DocFest Guest of Honor. He will participate in two public talks, and he also has handpicked a selection of new documentaries to play in the festival, including Daughters, Sugarcane, and Stone Mountain (the latter film is a world premiere taking part in International Competition).
In all, Sheffield DocFest 2024 is presenting 48 World Premieres, 14 International Premieres, 17 European Premieres, and 29 U.K. premieres, originating from 56 countries of production. As previously announced, the festival will open on June 12 with the world premiere of Oscar winner Kevin Macdonald’s Klitschko: More than a Fight, about former heavyweight boxing world champion Vitali Klitschko and his brother Wladimir. Vitali’s greatest challenge has come as mayor of Kyiv, protecting the Ukrainian capital in the face of brutal aggression from Russia.
This year’s festival theme is Reflections on Realities. Scroll for the full program.
“In planning this year’s edition of DocFest,” said Annabel Grundy, Sheffield DocFest managing director, “we have reflected about where we can make a difference, how our programming can counteract false narratives and over simplification, and how we can support our ecosystem at a time when independent journalism, co-authored narratives and deeply reflective works are critical in helping us make sense of the world. I am deeply proud of the team who have created a careful, compassionate and balanced program always with the filmmakers in mind.”
The Sheffield DocFest 2024 lineup totals 109 films — 80 features and 29 shorts. Films screen in three competitive categories – International Competition, International First Feature Competition, and International Short Film Competition. The festival features additional strands: Rhythms focuses on music documentaries and performances; Debates “features films on wide-ranging important topics which need to be discussed”; People &amp; Community includes stories that celebrate “togetherness through family, friendship and communities”; Journeys includes “transformations and explorations”; Memories explores “how the past informs the present”; and Rebellions focuses on stories of people “striving for social change and fighting for what matters.”
Raul Niño Zambrano, Sheffield DocFest creative director, said in a statement, “Curating a program is a collaborative effort, and I am incredibly grateful for the dedication and commitment of our international advisers, consultants, and staff who have invested their time in assessing all the films, artworks, and talks. The selection we have made together serves as an invitation for reflection, dialogue and empathy, and we can’t wait to share all these stories with our international audience.”

Coming out of a dual strike in which the guilds were adamant about setting guardrails for AI to protect actors and writers, several titles are taking various angles on the technology. 
In the New Frontier section there’s the documentary Eno about the legendary music producer of David Bowie, Talking Heads, U2 and other artists. The movie is billed as a “groundbreaking generative documentary”: It’s a different movie every time it’s seen. 
In the U.S. Documentary Competition section there’s Peter Sillen’s Love Machina following two futurists who commission an advanced humanoid AI named Bina48 to transfer Bina’s consciousness from a human to a robot in an attempt to continue their once-in-a-galaxy love affair for the rest of time.
In World Docs, there’s Eternal You from Hans Block and Moritz Riesewieck about startups which are using AI to create avatars that allow relatives to talk with their loved ones after they have died. 
Meanwhile, in the Next Section, there’s Jazmin Renée Jones’ Seeking Mavis Beacon which explores late ’80s educational software Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing. However, the program’s Haitian-born cover model vanished decades ago and two DIY investigators search for the cultural icon, while questioning notions of digital security, AI, and Black representation in the digital realm.
Coming out of the pandemic, indie filmmakers flooded Sundance with the most submissions yet at 17,435 titles from 153 countries or territories, including 4,410 feature-length films. Of these feature film submissions, 1,679 were from the U.S., and 2,741 were international. The eight episodic projects were selected from 573 submissions and there were 385 New Frontier submissions. From this, Sundance chose 82 feature-length films from 24 countries. Forty out of 101 (40%) feature film directors at this year’s fest are first-time feature filmmakers, and 11 of those features were supported by the Sundance Institute in development through direct granting or residency labs. World premieres make up 85, or 94%, of the Festival’s 90 feature films and episodic programs.
While movies will begin screening on Jan. 18 noon MT with premieres in Park City, it’s not necessarily an opening night swath of movies as in years past, rather a mélange. The Sundance Institute will host their fundraiser benefit, Opening Night Gala: Celebrating 40 Years Presented by Chase Sapphire.
On Jan. 25, select competition titles (U.S. Dramatic, U.S. Documentary, World Cinema Dramatic, World Cinema Documentary, and NEXT), as well as additional selections from the feature, episodic, and shorts programs will be available online at festival.sundance.org. The short film selections and 40th edition programming for the 2024 Sundance Film Festival will be announced on December 12.
“From the first edition in 1985, Sundance Film Festival has aimed to provide a space to gather, celebrate, and engage with risk-taking artists that are committed to bringing their independent visions to audiences — the Festival remains true to that goal to this day,” said Robert Redford, Sundance Institute Founder and President. “It continues to evolve, but its legacy of showcasing bold work that starts necessary conversations continues with the 2024 program.”
“The Institute takes great pride in the role the Festival plays in advancing our mission to support artists creating audacious work,” said Joana Vicente, Sundance Institute CEO. “This year is especially significant as we look back on our history of showcasing stories that surprise and delight, spark empathy and reflection, and honor our shared humanity. We’re all thrilled for this opportunity to celebrate the power of storytelling as we gather in January to introduce captivating works from acclaimed filmmakers and discover more new voices.”
“Sundance’s passion and power shines through its programming. Curation is Sundance’s secret sauce and we’re energized by the range of films, stories, and artists we’ve watched and selected from around the world,” saidEugene Hernandez, Director, Sundance Film Festival and Public Programming. “This Festival has had a vital history of first impressions: introductions to new talent, new friends, new worlds — our commitment to our artists and our audiences is fundamental to our work. Our programming team, lead by Kim Yutani, has curated 11 days of exciting new voices and stories for the many audiences we serve whether they’re joining us in Utah or experiencing the Festival offerings from afar. Sundance 2024 will be a special year for discovery and community.”
“While we don’t set out to program the Festival with a defined theme in mind, it became apparent this year that our slate’s biggest strength is how it showcases the vitality of independent storytelling,” said Kim Yutani, Sundance Film Festival Director of Programming. “Our program is tightly curated and covers a broad cross section of form, perspective, and genre that we’re looking forward to sharing with audiences. These titles are inventive and they beautifully represent the kind of groundbreaking work we’ve sought to amplify at Sundance throughout our history.”

Catherine Osborn,Is Western Pessimism on Latin America Overblown?,A new report debunks common narratives about the region’s stagnation.,https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/02/16/latin-america-economics-democracy-west-report-nearshoring-china/,https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Arevalo-Borrel-EU-Guatemala-GettyImages-1923335492.jpg?w=1000,2024-02-16T13:00:35Z,"Welcome back to Foreign Policys Latin America Brief.Welcome back to Foreign Policys Latin America Brief.
The highlights this week: Researchers seek to correct misconceptions about Latin Americas economic outlook, Russia cuts down on Ecuadorianbanana imports, and generative AI reveals the U.S. role in weapons flows to Mexico.
On Monday, a group that included a senior Spanish diplomat; scholars from Latin America, the United States, and Spain; and current and former officials from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund gathered at Georgetown University in Washington for a seminar provocatively titled Why Does Latin America Matter?
Its a question that Spain has prioritized over the past 18 months. Last year, Madrid used its authority as president of the Council of the European Union to organize a summit between the European Union and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States. Spain was also a vocal advocate for concluding the EU-Mercosur trade deal in months of intense but ultimately unfruitful talks.
Researchers from the Elcano Royal Institute, a think tank funded in part by the Spanish government, compiled the report that was the centerpiece of Mondays event and was also presented to Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez. The researchers conducted more than eight months of interviews with European think tanks, business leaders, politicians, and academics, asking broad questions about their perceptions of the region, said Elcanos José Juan Ruiz, one of the lead authors of the study.
Ruizs team was concerned by the responses they received. Once we started this debate, we could not stop, because it was so misguided, he said. What most of these different interest groups in Europe think about Latin America is very clear, he continued, citing a list of those impressions: Democracy is weak. The region is an economic disaster. China is the new hegemon. And companies that invested in Latin America in the 1990s amid an economic opening destroyed value for their shareholders.
The Spanish research group dug through data and concluded that these claims were generally overblown, if not outright false, Ruiz said. He argued that for European companies and firms, intensifying ties with Latin America made geopolitical and business sense. The report found that the portion of the worlds debt and financial crises that occurred in Latin America dropped significantly in the last two decades compared with the three previous decades. On governance, the countries in the region are generally democracies.
Writing off the region is really very costly, said Ruiz, an economist and former Spanish government official.
Although trade between China and South America is high, the total investment stock of U.S. and EU firms in Latin America is 20 times that of Chinese firms, the study noted. And European and U.S. firms buy more of what the study called high value-added South American exports than do Chinese companiespurchasing machine parts instead of soybeans, for example. High-value goods are an export class that Latin American countries want to grow.
At the United Nations, Latin American nations usually vote with the West on resolutions regarding democracy, human rights, and territorial integrity. This sets the region apart from most other developing regions and aligns it more closely with EU foreign-policy positions than many of the Eastern European countries vying for EU membership, former Uruguayan Foreign Minister Ernesto Talvi, another lead author of the study, said at the Monday event.
Finally, when it comes to the ability for foreign companies to make money, the paper found that Spanish firms see a net return of 4.8 percent per year in Latin America, compared with 3.5 percent for equivalent investments in the developed world. Thats why they are largely reinvesting their earnings in the region.
The Elcano report provides data-based assurances that so-called friendshoring to Latin America can make business sense. More broadly, it offers a glass-half-full take on the regions current trajectory. The research adds to many of the points made by Americas Quarterlys Brian Winter in an essay last October laying out a relatively bullish case for doing business in the region.
Mondays event included two panels to debate the merits of the Elcano report. Some panelists quibbled that a fair-stock take of the region should include more information on shortcomings such as low-quality education and organized crime. But many attendees also voiced comments such as that of the Brookings Institutions Santiago Levy, a former Mexican official and former vice president of the Inter-American Development Bank.
Its refreshing and forces you to think, Levy said. Its always good if you have somebody from the outside who is a friend, and I mean Spain. They take a cold look at the region from the outside, and you say, Look, guys. You can do it.

Russias banana ban. Russia said this month that it would suspend purchases from some Ecuadorian banana exporters following a deal in which Ecuador agreed to supply the United States with military parts. The United States has said those parts would be shipped to Ukraine. Russias banana ban is significant. Bananas are a major Ecuadorian export; until now, around 98 percent of bananas arriving in Russia from overseas came from Ecuador.
The U.S.-Ecuador deal represents rare arms support to Ukraine from Latin America and Caribbean countries, which have generally shunned U.S. requests for military aid to Kyiv. But center-right Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa has signaled he hopes to improve Quitos relations with Washington and is committing tosecurity cooperation with the United States to address a domestic crime wave.   
The Wall Street view on Caracas. Wall Street traders who deal in government-issued debt played a role in lobbying the U.S. government for its October 2023 move to lift sanctions on Venezuela, the Wall Street Journal reported this week. The traders observed that U.S. sanctions had pushed Venezuela to intensify financial ties with Russia via debt markets and alerted U.S. officials.
Even if Washington reimposes most of its sanctions on Caracas this year due to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduros noncompliance with U.S. expectations for free and fair elections, government debt markets might remain untouched, the Journal reported. Such a sanctions snapback appeared even more likely this week after news broke on Tuesday that the Maduro administration had imprisoned a prominent human rights researcher, Rocío San Miguel.

Brazils balloon bandits. Of the illicit activities that occur in Rio de Janeiro, hot air ballooning is less known to outsiders. But residents of the city and surrounding suburbs are used to seeing hot air balloons streak the sky despite a decades-old ban. The Guardian reported this week on the law-flouting Brazilians who engage in the practiceand have, on some occasions, launched 10-story-high balloons or loaded balloons with fireworks. Practitioners of large-scale ballooning call it gigantismo, or gigantism.

Generative artificial intelligence may help reveal cross-border flows of arms to criminal groups in Latin America. For years, researchers who study arms flows in the region have used photos of weapons uploaded to social media to pinpoint details about where guns were originally manufactured. But AI allows researchers to scour much more open-source data on the internet.
Andrei Serbin Pont, the president of the Regional Coordinator of Economic and Social Research (CRIES), a Latin American think tank, wrote in Bellingcat last week that AI has given researchers from CRIES and Florida International University stronger capabilities to process open-source data. Members of his team upload their findings to a platform they run on the so-called small arms and light weapons trade in the region (i.e., handguns rather than tanks).
The platforms data appeared to reinforce an assertion from Mexico that U.S.-manufactured guns are flooding into the country and being used in criminal violence. Mexicos government has sued U.S. gunmakers in a lawsuit that was revived by a U.S. appeals court last month. The suit claims that U.S. gunmakers abet weapons illegal use by Mexican cartels.
Dangerous weapons dont just end up in the hands of criminal cartels, Mexican journalist Chantal Flores wrote in an article co-published by Foreign Policy and the Dial last year, adding that Mexico only has one legal gun store. Much of this trafficking is done by people with dual citizenship or Americans hired by drug cartels.
The AI-enhanced data platform has also revealed concerning trends elsewhere in the region, such as the apparent use of Peruvian army grenades by Ecuadorian criminal groups.",,Foreign Policy

“Love Me”
The number of films available for virtual viewing will be about the same as in 2023, which saw a return to in-person festivities in Park City after two years of an exclusively virtual festival during COVID. All of the Competition titles (U.S. Dramatic, U.S. Documentary, World Cinema Dramatic, World Cinema Documentary, and NEXT) will be available online during the January 25-28 window. The shorts lineup and special 40th anniversary programming will be announced on December 12 — yes, this is the 40th Sundance Film Festival. 
The 82 feature films in the lineup were created by 101 directors, 40 of whom are first-time feature filmmakers, a jump from last year when 28 percent of the lineup’s directors were first-timers. On the other hand, another 37 of the filmmakers are returning alums of previous editions of Sundance. And 11 of the films on the lineup were projects supported through Sundance Institute programs.
When big shakeup for the 40th edition — other than the Kids section now being titled Family Matinee — is that festivities will kick off earlier than ever: Right at noon Mountain Time on Thursday, January 18, for a full day of premieres to follow beyond what was typical for “Day One” — terminology not being used as much this time — in the past.

For centuries, farmers used almanacs to try to understand and predict weather patterns.
Now, a new crop of Latin American startups is helping do that with artificial intelligence, promising a farming revolution in agricultural giants like Brazil, the world’s biggest exporter of soybeans, corn and beef.
Aline Oliveira Pezente, a 39-year-old entrepreneur from the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, was working at agriculture company Louis Dreyfus Commodities when she noticed a problem in how the farming industry operates in Brazil. 
Producers need huge amounts of credit up-front to buy inputs like seed and fertilizer, she says. But lenders are wary given how difficult it is to size up the myriad risks, from the natural — droughts, floods, crop disease, erosion — to the financial — bankruptcy, price crashes and more.
In 2018, Aline and her husband Fabricio launched a startup called Traive that collects massive amounts of agriculture-related data, then analyzes it with AI, breaking down the capital risk for lenders and giving farmers easier access to credit.
“Lenders used to each use their own (risk analysis) model. Imagine like a giant Excel file,” Aline told AFP. “But it’s very hard for humans, even those who are super knowledgeable of statistics and mathematics, to create equations that capture the nuances of all the variables.
“They were taking three months to do something that we can do in five minutes with way better accuracy,” said Aline, who has a master’s degree specializing in AI and data analysis from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
– AI for agriculture –
Seven years on, Traive’s clients include agro-industry giants like Syngenta, fintech firms and Latin America’s second-biggest bank, Banco do Brasil. More than 70,000 producers use its platform, which has facilitated nearly $1 billion in financial operations, it says.
Aline presented her work this week at the Rio de Janeiro edition of Web Summit, the massive tech gathering dubbed “Davos for Geeks.”
Speaking alongside her on a panel called “Harvesting Data: The Next Agricultural Revolution,” fellow entrepreneur Alejandro Mieses explained how AI has the potential to reshape farming.
Worldwide, farmers are increasingly turning to AI to boost yields and returns, with applications like self-driving tractors, drones that track crop health and smart cameras that recognize weeds for herbicide treatment.
Mieses’s Puerto Rico-based startup, TerraFirma, developed an AI model that uses satellite images to forecast environmental risks like natural disasters, crop disease and erosion.
“We insist on the physics of it, because we believe that is the base point. Understanding how water moves, how wind moves, how different solar exposures operate throughout your farmland,” he said at Web Summit, of which AFP is a media partner this year.
The hard part, the panelists said: AI models have to be trained on massive amounts of data.
Although farmers tend to be data-obsessed — painstakingly tracking environmental conditions, inputs and productivity — gathering and processing that information around the world is complex.
“It’s quite resource-intensive. You need servers, you need an immense repository of data,” said Mieses, 39.
“It’s the same old story of garbage in, garbage out.”
– Climate question –
The agriculture industry faces criticism in countries like Brazil, whose rise as an agricultural powerhouse has also seen a surge of environmental destruction in key regions like the Amazon rainforest, a vital resource against climate change.
Innovation optimists argue that, with the world’s population expected to reach nearly 10 billion people by 2050, technologies like AI are humanity’s best hope for surviving without destroying the planet.
Mariana Vasconcelos is the 32-year-old chief executive of Brazilian startup Agrosmart, which uses AI to help farmers manage climate risks and produce more sustainably.
“The UN Food and Agriculture Organization says we need to increase food production to feed a growing population. At the same time, we have to produce with less: less land, less deforestation, less carbon footprint. How can we do that without technology?” she said.
“Agriculture is often seen as opposed to nature. But I think technology is showing that actually it can regenerate, restore the environment, work together with nature… Agriculture is headed for a more sustainable model.”",,Digital Journal

By: Jacob Nordangård, PhD via The Pharos Chronicle
At the G20 leaders meeting in India, under the motto One Earth, One Family, One Future, the new concept Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) and the NGO One Future Alliance were launched. These initiatives intend to increase the interconnectedness of the data-based systems with the aim of meeting the Sustainable Development Goals The fusion of the United Nations Agenda 2030 and World Economic Forums Fourth Industrial Revolution. This constitutes the foundation for the technetronic society for social and planetary engineering that was envisioned by Zbigniew Brzezinski in his 1970 book Between two Ages. Welcome to the New International Economic Order!
Everything the G20 does is based on Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals. The leaders of the worlds 19 largest economies commit to accelerate the full and effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to advocate lifestyles for Sustainable Development. The latter includes the introduction of a social credit system that rewards correct sustainable behaviour. As expressed in the G20 High Level Principles on Lifestyles for Sustainable Development:
Leverage data to support and enable last mile behaviour change towards adopting and incentivising sustainable lifestyles and consumer choices.

In order to fulfill the SDGs and tackle other global challenges, artificial intelligence will also be used in a responsible way and, for example, be used to detect potential risks.
To unlock the full potential of AI, equitably share its benefits and mitigate risks, we will work together to promote international cooperation and further discussions on international governance for AI.
The DPI concept includes, among other things, digital identity, digital payment systems and data sharing mechanisms.
These are key technologies in the digital economy where all transactions will be monitored. This is also a part of the G20 commitment to build an international tax system. But also for preventing money laundering and financing of terrorism as well as to facilitate vaccine delivery and climate action. They also form a basis for Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), which is gradually being tested in several countries. over the world. The concept is mentioned in the Leaders Communiqué.
We welcome discussions on the potential macro-financial implications arising from the introduction and adoption of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), notably on cross-border payments as well as on the international monetary and financial system.
At the same time, developing countries are given a voice in global decision-making. Notably, the African Union (AU) has now become an official member of the G20 (which should mean a name change to the G21).
In practice, however, this means that they are incorporated into the One Family and will obey the dictates of the overlords and implement collective action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to net zero.
Officially, the BRICS member and this years G20 host nation India is the originator of the Digital Public Infrastructure (note that the G20 consists of both the G7 group and the BRICS countries). However, they have had assistance from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and The World Bank in developing the concept (which was unanimously approved at the Digitalisation Ministers meeting in mid-August this year).
Participating knowledge partners included the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Omidyar Network India, Center for Digital Public Infrastructure (CDPI), Indias Aapti Institute, as well as the consulting firms and WEF members Dalberg and Boston Consulting Group.
The Evil Twins of Technocracy and Transhumanism
It is clear that WEF has an agenda-setting role as Bill Gates (WEF Global Leader of Tomorrow 1993) and eBay founder Pierre Omidyar (WEF GLT 1999) also have close connections to the organization.
The G20 interest group B20 (Business20), which gathers business interests, is totally dominated by the World Economic Forum and lists powerful international advisers such as Börge Brende (President of WEF), Michael Bloomberg (Bloomberg L.P.), Satya Nadella (Microsoft), Lynn Forester de Rothschild (E.L. Rothschild, WEF GLT 1995) and Marcus Wallenberg (SEB, WEF GLT 1994). This is the worlds financial elite with tight links to Davos, the Bilderberg Group and the Trilateral Commission. Their communiqué is over 100 pages long and is illustrated with images linked to the fusion of humans with technology. They belong to the bizarre futuristic techno-cult that ultimately runs the show.
Not entirely unsurprisingly, their policy recommendations consist of rapidly rolling out Digital Public Infrastructure to implement the digital transformation. This illustrates the great influence that these actors have in comparison with other interest groups. Us ordinary mortals have no say in this.
In connection with the meeting with the digitisation ministers, UNDP also released the reports Accelerating the SDGs through Digital Public Infrastructure and The DPI Approach: A Playbook, where the concept is linked to the sustainability agenda. The first report shows clear parallels to WEF and PwCs futuristic report Unlocking Technology for the Global Goals from January 2020, and aims to provide guidance for governments, NGOs, multilateral organisations and the private sector.
The Center for Digital Public Infrastructure is in turn supported by Co-Develop. An initiative created in the wake of the pandemic in August 2021 by the Rockefeller Foundation, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the UN-led Digital Public Goods Alliance to help countries use DPI for emergency relief and long-term resilience. Under the leadership of the Rockefeller Foundation, the report Co-Develop Digital Public Infrastructure for an Equitable Recovery was also released during the meeting.
The Rockefeller and Gates foundations are omnipresent and the whole agenda largely follows the Lock Step scenario from the Rockefeller Foundations Scenarios for the Future of Technology and International Development from 2010.
Both foundations were well prepared and unlocked their technocratic concepts and tech solutions on a global scale while the world was in lockdown and in a state of shock.
This is part of the global coup détat which ultimately manifests itself in the UNs Our Common Agenda and the tight-knit alliance that has been formed between global mega-corporations, financial institutions, and the UN system. This is what Paul Raskin of The Great Transition Initiative and Club of Rome refers to as the New Earth Order.
One Future Alliance
To create synergies in implementing DPI, the G20 also launched the One Future Alliance. A voluntary initiative that will bring together governments, the private sector, academia, civil society organisations and donor agencies. We can assume which actors that will be ready. According to the G20 High Level Principles on Lifestyles for Sustainable Development, One Future means:
Integrated approach for achieving our shared goals on development, environment and climate with human beings at the centre of our actions, leaving no one behind One Future.
India itself has taken the lead in rapidly introducing the new technology and the introduction of a inclusive cashless digital payment system for all. The same process is underway in a large number of countries worldwide and will intensify in the coming years.
Next years G20 host nation is BRICS-member Brazil, with its leaders meeting held in Rio De Janeiro. It is worth noting that the Club of Rome released a report in 1976, named RIO Reshaping the International Order, which presented a plan for a new international order.
16 years later, Agenda 21 (Agenda for the 21st Century) was launched at The Earth Summit in Rio to kick-start this process, which is now reaching its final steps. Brazil has listed Reform of the global governance institutions as one of three key issues to be dealt with.
The agenda will be cemented more firmly with the signing of the Leaders Pact of the Future on United Nations Summit of the Future in September 2024.
We welcome ongoing efforts at the UN, including the Secretary Generals efforts to address the SDG financing gap through an SDG stimulus, and will provide full support to the United Nations 2023 SDG Summit, the United Nations Summit of the Future, and other relevant processes.
The G20 cycle of hosting nations ends in 2025 with BRICS-member South Africa as the final host. This means that next years Leaders Troika (consisting of previous, current and coming years host nations) will consist of three BRICS members.
May we venture a guess that the leaders meeting will be held in Johannesburg, just like the second Earth Summit in 2002? It would be a perfect setting as the name gives associations to the Book of Revelation and might be a starting point for unleashing the digital beast (AI) that is to judge mankind and keep us within the planetary boundaries.

</li></ul>AMSTERDAM, February 29, 2024 Conceived by Stellantis as an open forum for the public to hear a broad range of perspectives as society faces the mobility challenges of the future, the Freedom of Mobility Forums second annual live debate promises to bring diverse and possibly controversial opinions. The event on April 3, 2024, will be facilitated by a neutral third-party and will address: How will our planet accommodate the mobility needs of eight billion people? The discussion will explore how planetary limits could reshape freedom of mobility from technology, business, and lifestyle perspectives. 
The Freedom of Mobility Forum was founded on four main principles: a global, 360-degree approach; fact-based insights; openness and transparency for the public; and honest, respectful, and collaborative engagement. The international expert panelists already have divergent points of view as demonstrated by their initial comments:
<ul><li>Society: Majora Carter (United States), Urban revitalization strategist, real estate developer, author and award-winning broadcaster </li></ul>The Freedom of Mobility Forum is about quality of life, the ability to go as you please but, also the ability to stay because you want to.

Cecilia R. Edwards, partner at Wavestone, a global consulting firm, will serve again as facilitator, moderating the open discussion among the panelists and students from three universities. Viewers of the live event will also have the opportunity to interact directly with the panelists throughout the program via three dedicated Q&amp;A sessions.

This year's roster, which will be covered here by Brian Tallerico, Robert Daniels, and Marya Gates, includes new projects by Steven Soderbergh, Richard Linklater, Jesse Eisenberg, Dawn Porter, Chris Smith, and hundreds more. We can't wait to cover it and wanted you to know about what's coming. The full press release with all the details is copied below. Today the nonprofit Sundance Institute announced the 82 films, eight episodic titles, and a New Frontier interactive experience selected for the 2024 Sundance Film Festival. The Festival will take place January 18–28, 2024, in person in Park City and Salt Lake City, with a selection of titles available online nationwide from January 25–28, 2024. This year marks the 40th edition of the Festival, bringing together audiences in Utah and beyond to celebrate Sundance’s rich history of supporting engaging new stories and groundbreaking independent artists. In-Person Ticket Packages and Passes and Online Ticket Packages and Passes are currently on sale and single film tickets go on sale January 11 at 10 a.m. MT.  To kick things off, the Festival will begin at noon MT on January 18 with premieres in Park City, showcasing the range of offerings in this year's lineup across categories. Adding to the festivities, on the evening of January 18, the Institute will host the Opening Night Gala: Celebrating 40 Years Presented by Chase Sapphire®. The fundraiser will benefit the year round artist support work of the Sundance Institute. Films will debut in Park City starting January 18, with additional showings in Park City and Salt Lake City over the course of the Festival. Select titles also become available online beginning January 25, including all Competition titles (U.S. Dramatic, U.S. Documentary, World Cinema Dramatic, World Cinema Documentary, and NEXT), as well as additional selections from the feature, episodic, and shorts programs. Audiences can experience the curated online selection exclusively via festival.sundance.org. The online program, as noted below per listing, will allow fans of independent storytelling across the country to enjoy a sampling of the Festival lineup from wherever they are. The short film selections and 40th edition programming for the 2024 Sundance Film Festival will be announced on December 12. “From the first edition in 1985, Sundance Film Festival has aimed to provide a space to gather, celebrate, and engage with risk-taking artists that are committed to bringing their independent visions to audiences — the Festival remains true to that goal to this day,” said Robert Redford, Sundance Institute Founder and President. “It continues to evolve, but its legacy of showcasing bold work that starts necessary conversations continues with the 2024 program.” “The Institute takes great pride in the role the Festival plays in advancing our mission to support artists creating audacious work,” said Joana Vicente, Sundance Institute CEO. “This year is especially significant as we look back on our history of showcasing stories that surprise and delight, spark empathy and reflection, and honor our shared humanity. We’re all thrilled for this opportunity to celebrate the power of storytelling as we gather in January to introduce captivating works from acclaimed filmmakers and discover more new voices.” “Sundance’s passion and power shines through its programming. Curation is Sundance’s secret sauce and we’re energized by the range of films, stories, and artists we’ve watched and selected from around the world,” said Eugene Hernandez, Director, Sundance Film Festival and Public Programming. “This Festival has had a vital history of first impressions: introductions to new talent, new friends, new worlds — our commitment to our artists and our audiences is fundamental to our work. Our programming team, lead by Kim Yutani, has curated 11 days of exciting new voices and stories for the many audiences we serve whether they’re joining us in Utah or experiencing the Festival offerings from afar. Sundance 2024 will be a special year for discovery and community.” “While we don't set out to program the Festival with a defined theme in mind, it became apparent this year that our slate's biggest strength is how it showcases the vitality of independent storytelling,” said Kim Yutani, Sundance Film Festival Director of Programming. “Our program is tightly curated and covers a broad cross section of form, perspective, and genre that we’re looking forward to sharing with audiences. These titles are inventive and they beautifully represent the kind of groundbreaking work we’ve sought to amplify at Sundance throughout our history.” The full slate of works announced today includes 82 feature-length films representing 24 countries. The 2024 program is composed of 40 of 101 (40%) feature film directors who are first-time feature filmmakers, and 11 of the feature films and projects announced today were supported by Sundance Institute in development through direct granting or residency labs. World premieres make up 85, or 94%, of the Festival’s 90 feature films and episodic programs announced today. Also announced today is the winner of the 2024 Alfred P. Sloan Feature Film Prize, an annual award given to an artist with the most outstanding depiction of science and technology in a feature film. This year the prize has gone to ""Love Me,"" screening in the U.S. Dramatic Competition category. The Sundance Film Festival is an artist program of the Sundance Institute, a nonprofit that has impacted thousands of artists every year plus thousands more through its public programming. Proceeds earned through Festival ticket sales go to uplifting and developing emerging artists on a year-round basis through focused labs, direct grants, fellowships, residencies, and more. These films were selected from a record number of 17,435 submissions from 153 countries or territories, including 4,410 feature-length films. Of these feature film submissions, 1,679 were from the U.S., and 2,741 were international. The eight episodic projects were selected from 573 submissions and there were 385 New Frontier submissions.

Legend has it, that when things go wrong and everybody is hoping for better times, they first have to get worse, before a new era of peace and harmony may emerge.
We may now be at these crossroads. The Beast is Rising. But its Fall is in sight.
We have to understand, the Beast is Big. Its Huge. Its so extraordinarily big, humanity has never faced something like it in recorded history.
So, we better are properly prepared.
Imagine, a small handkerchief or a pocket-square (a tiny decorative lapel accessory) is sitting on a huge quintuple king-size bedsheet, aiming at controlling the bedsheet. Thats the globalist Cult Elite, aiming at converting the world population into a One World Order (OWO). It will not happen. Its an image so absurd that could have only emerged form a megalomaniac which is what the WEF and its Master, Klaus Schwab, and his behind the scene money masters are.
No matter, how powerful they think they are, tyrannizing the world at large into their slaves, We, the People, will make sure it will not happen. Fissures in the OWO ranks are already clearly visible.
The new motto is bye-bye OWO-Globalism and welcome to the new multipolar world.
Actually, a world that is gradually becoming an east-west polarization, with a west that is ever faster decaying in more ways than one monetary-wise, in term of political ethics, as well as faltering support from western and hitherto western-leaning governments and, at least, by two thirds of western people, who vehemently oppose their governments.
Mind you, we are not quite there yet at the point of western collapse.
However, the crack in the wall, where the light shines through [paraphrasing a famous Leonard Cohen song] gives enormous hope for the light to prevail.
The Big Picture what is it?
The Big Picture has three major branches, three major objectives of the Beast to fulfill. Imagine the Beast as a multiple-tentacled Monster-Octopus. Listed not necessarily in order of priority, but rather as a simultaneous bulldozing approach, they include:
i) Massive depopulation, genocide, worldwide; an eugenist agenda on which the Gates and Rockefellers et al, have worked already for decades, and already their predecessor generations were obsessed with eugenics. Less people, less useless eaters and consumers of scarce, unrenewable resources. So bluntly presents it Yuval Noah Hariri, Israeli intellectual and close adviser to Klaus Schwab, the WEFs eternal CEO;
ii) Shifting assets from the lower and middle echelons to the top the elite, billionaires, individuals, as well as corporate finance, such as BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street; others may include Fidelity, City Bank, Bank of America and many more.
The first three alone are interlinked as shareholders and can act as one, controlling an estimated 25 trillion dollars, worldwide, giving them a leverage power of way above US$ 100 trillion (compared to the worlds GDP of about US$ 90 trillion), thereby having virtual control over every country on the globe, and
iii) Digitization of everything, connecting everything with everything, eventually with the mega-powerful ultra-shortwaves 5G and soon to come 6G. Through these electromagnetic waves, they may access our brains. Its Klaus Schwabs pipedream. It includes digital worldwide unform vaxx-passes, managed through the infamous QR-code, or similar, with practically illimited info-storage capacity.
Currently it has a potential of storing more than 30,000 pieces of information about each one of us. Those who manage the QR-code, know you better than you know yourself. It is an updated version of Bill Gates Agenda ID2020.
Digitization may, as a first step, include an under-the-skin chip on every surviving citizen currently being volunteer-practiced in some Nordic countries, like Sweden and Denmark, storing and monitoring every piece of info about you, incl. health records, bank accounts, with whom you talk, where you travel, where and what you shop — and-and-and you got the picture.
Later, it will likely just be an electronic fingerprint in the form or capacity of a QR-code or its successor, that is engrained in our bodies through an electromagnetic field which is being injected into our bloodstream graphene oxide, for example under the pretext of covid vaxxes, or eventually any vaxxes invented and forced upon the population.
The next one may be the new flu-vaxx already announced as a novelty, practically untested, but ready for the fall season. Be aware and beware!
Digital money, already largely dominating the Global North, will become the norm by the end of Agenda 2030, or sooner if WE, the People, do not stop it. And yes, we can. Digital money would make us to digital slaves; digital money could be blocked at will by the Cult Cabal, or outright stolen, depending on our behavior.
No worries, according to Klaus Schwab, we eventually will own nothing but will be happy thats the paraphrased ending of the Great Reset. Our mind will no longer think independently, but 5G and the graphene oxide injected by the covid and other vaxxes still to come, will make from humans so-called transhumans (expression used by Klaus Schwab in an interview in 2016 with the Swiss French TV), basically useless and dispensable slaves, since robots and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will have taken over human roles.
These goals are all addressed in one way or another in the WEFs Great Reset. It may be worth your while to have a glance at it. Most libraries contacted, answered with a smile, they dont carry the book; theyd rather not associate with this monster plan.
Here is the Amazon link for The Great Reset.
The globalist agenda is gradually disintegrating. See this on the anti-globalist trend of the WEF in Davos, May 2022.
Yet, the globalists keep fighting on. A hopeless game. But they may be able to extend their globalist drive for a while, with perpetual lies, untold riches of immorally and largely illegally acquired financial wealth, possibly bringing about millions of victims and, God forbit leading into WWIII, potentially meaning a hard-core nuclear war.
The Beast is still on the rise. That does not mean it is winning.
Many of us may not notice. It is discrete, but deadly. In all its discretion, it keeps announcing what it is planning, what is in store for humanity. The Cult, the Luciferian Cult, to which the Beast likely belongs, in order to succeed, has to announce its action well in advance. Lest they, the Cult, may not prosper.
The Cults Warnings
The Cult has repeatedly warned us throughout the last at least 50 years. It has always told us well-in-advance wat they and their minions were planning. And this with increasing intensity in the last two to three decades. Just a few examples. Most of us have conveniently ignored their warnings.
The 1992 Earth Summit in Rio official name United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 3-14 June 1992. It was based on the Club of Romes (in)famous 1971 publication Limits to Growth, A Simulation Model of World Population, Environment and Economics. The model predicted a looming environmental disaster in the coming 50 to 100 years, i.e., beginning just about now.
The Club of Rome, alias the Earth Summit, gave the impetus for what is today known as the Global Warming cum Climate Change Agenda with its commercial side-kick, the New Green Deal.
You must know, the Club of Rome was not a European invention, as the name may have you believe. It was a Rockefeller initiative.
9/11 was the deadly, violent event to announce a new era an era of increasing to total control, depriving personal liberties, restrictions with often denigrating and embarrassing airport security checks. A few weeks after the well-organized horrendous 9/11-devastation, the Patriot Act was passed through Congress. It had been prepared way before 9/11. It deprives US citizens of nearly 90% of their human and citizen rights.
Similar emergency type laws were passed with ease in Europe and other so-called western countries, referring to countries following the US political and monetary doctrine. Most of the Global North, or the West (also including, Australia, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand), currently lives under some kind of an emergency legislation, largely circumventing their Parliaments for matters that deal with the Great Reset Agenda.
Most of their populations have no clue that their Parliaments have been partially disabled.
The 2010 Rockefeller Report depicts the contents of the UN Agenda 2030 in four Chapters. The first one describes the Lockstep scenario. Pretty much what the world, the 193 UN member countries, went through after the worldwide declared lockdown for the covid-19 plandemic. In lockstep, every government followed the same human rights destroying stern rules, instilled and coerced by fear, dictated by WHO. See this full 2010 Rockefeller Report  chapters The Scenario Framework and the Scenario Narratives are of particular interest.
Bill Gates TedTalk February 2010in San Diego he advocated:
If we are doing a real good job (vaccinating], we may reduce world population by 10% to 15%.
This was just a trial balloon to gauge peoples reaction.
It was also an announcement of things to come. As we know by now the ultimate target of world population is something of the order of half a billion people as indicated on the Georgia Guidestones which have recently been vandalized. No worries, the cabal will not reach that mass-genocide target. But it has already done immense harm, and if not stopped, will continue killing people, many in the most atrocious ways.
WHO declares in 2014 the decade of vaccination referring to the decade of 2020 to 2030, i.e., the UN Agenda 2030. Did anybody pay attention? How did WHO know? Maybe Bill Gates was whispering the orders in the WHO halls where donations are collected. Conveniently, any reference to this WHO warning has disappeared form internet.
June 2016 the Swiss Gotthard tunnel inauguration a bizarre Luciferian Celebration, depicting lockstep Luciferian sex-dances and strange killings and deaths – remotely related to tunnel construction. Full of symbolism.
Googles explanation While tunnels certainly represent journeys, they more often symbolize the passage from one phase of life to another. In its most primal meaning, the tunnel symbolizes the birth canal. Just as a baby evolves and journeys outward, so do characters of a story.
See also this 6-min. Gotthard Tunnel inauguration video clip.
It is certainly a passage through darkness. No surprise. Not evil or Lucifer ever projected a world of light for us, the common people. All to the contrary, the more obscure they keep us, the more fear they instill, the more control they gain. And that is what seems they want to play out. To no avail. They wont succeed.
Event 201 of 18 October 2019 in NYC The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201, a high-level pandemic exercise on October 18, 2019, in New York City.
The Events website describes the exercise as an aera where public / private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences. The real object of the exercise was just the opposite, via a corona virus.
By coincidence, a few weeks later, at the beginning of 2020, a corona-virus broke out, called SARS-Cov-2, alias Covid-19. WHO declared it a pandemic on 11 March 2020, when reported deaths, worldwide, were fewer than 5000. Knowing what we know today, one may ask: How reliable are these death reports then and today?
Compare this with 52,000 flu-related deaths in the US during the 2017 / 2018 flu-season. The common flu was never declared a pandemic. See this.
We are now being warned about the impending food shortages, energy shortages that will bring about a cold winter, famine; plus, a sizable recession preceded by horrendous double-digit inflation that in turn will trigger bankruptcies, unemployment, poverty, misery and more deaths.
The Beasts ascent is not undisturbed. There are forces pulling in other directions, attempting pulling it down, sideways and outright apart. The massive crack in the wall, that lets the Light shine through, is getting bigger and bigger. Once the light reaches a sufficient amount of people, a critical mass the Beasts reign may be getting close to an end.
We are not there yet. Unfortunately. But we must think positive. Inspiring each other spiritually. Creating a mental and spiritual togetherness. We, the Awakened People, can bring this diabolical era to an end.
Following the lead mentioned above, the Beast may be depicted as a multiple-tentacled Monster-Octopus. Each tentacle has its deadly mission. Many tentacles have sub-tentacles. In case a tentacle is defeated the others will fight on, and the defeated one will grow back with even greater vigor. Thats the concept.
We have to be aware and conscious of these multiple-scenarios and the Big Picture they constitute, so as not to allow our attention to being deviated by one single scenario for example, the plandemic and vaxx narrative. Though, admittedly important, it ought to be connected to all other tentacle-scenarios, lest we miss the overall objectives of The Great Reset Agenda, alias UN Agenda 2030.
We want to stop this human-made criminal Outbreak of misery and death as a whole, in its entirety. If we do it by compartment, our chances to overcome the Beast are largely diminished. The Cult Cabal counts on us being distracted by one or two tentacles, while the others keep laboring ahead almost undisturbed reaching gradually their goals.
It is utterly important that we are aware that all the tentacles are connected. There are no coincidences; and there is no single frontline in this war. The entire humanity, no matter where we are on this globe, is the frontline. That also means, there is no escape.
Unless, and this is crucial, we wake up. This is our escape. We, the People, see the light, and ascend to another level where the darkness of the Beast cannot reach us anymore. We need a critical mass for our Peoples Power to be strong enough, to pull us, humanity, through and collectively onto a different, higher and enlightened plane.
To do that, for those who are awake, who see the Beast, who see the tentacles and their machinations as killing machines, it is utmost important that we always see the overall objective of the Great Reset, the UN Agenda 2030, and the 4th Industrial Revolution, hence, the Big Picture.
When we fight one tentacle, say, the covid narrative, an important one, we must always remember that there are others, and that covid is only one cog in the wheel, in the gear of the Reset destruction.
The covid tentacle has many sub-tentacles: Big Pharma is one; the vaxx-mandate is another one; the useless and socially degrading forced mask-wearing, social distancing, and home-office work, are all ways of humiliating, separating and isolating individuals. And so forth. They all play nicely into each other, enhancing each other, psychologically, by FEAR, and physically, by various forms of other than covid diseases, i.e., all types of cancers, leukemias, liver-kidney and heart failures and much more; all potentially deadly. Indeed, they have already caused exponentially more deaths than the covid-plandemics is said to have caused.
It would, therefore, be unwise to put all our scientific knowledge into the vaxx debate, or the covid infection is it real, or isnt it? It doesnt matter. But by doing just this, we are playing into the devils hands.
While it is a must to identify the covid fraud describing the scam scientifically by medical doctors, virologists and other scientists, but it is by far not enough.  The public at large must understand the cheat, so they may be able to shed off the immune system destroying fear.
Overall objectives of the Reset are in plain view. Therefore, we must expose and connect the Cults covid fraud and the fear it causes, to all other tentacles of the Octopus-Beast. We must fight the entire GREAT RESET Narrative as a whole and in solidarity.
Other Tentacles of the Octopus-Beast
Fear, already mentioned before, is yet another deadly tentacle. It is well known in psychology, that fear the constant tension of fear lowers our auto-immune defense. It renders us increasingly vulnerable to all kinds of diseases, including a myriad of different cancers and diseases of our vital organs. They all may lead to death, at which point it will be next to impossible to trace the cause of disease and death back to the poisonous covid-vaxx.
Fear is one of the Beasts strongest weapons. Not only does it destroy our natural immunity, fear makes us blind and obedient. Blind to our own human rights. For fear, we give them up, hoping the Beast will safe us. Instead, we are becoming slaves slaves to our governments, who are, in turn, the servants of the WEF and the Beast.
Climate Change the ever-most ferociously propaganda-pushed agenda that the planet will heat up, that we humans are the culprits, as we use excessive amounts of fossil fuel, creating so-called greenhouse gases, driving world temperatures through the roof. As mentioned above, this is the continuation of the Rockefeller-initiated Club of Rome agenda to enslave the (western) world through guilt.
We, of the western / Global Norths Judo-Christian beliefs or cultures, are beset by guilt, as part of our guilt-driven up-bringing.  Its part of our religious cum cultural inheritance. So, we are extremely vulnerable when told that we, humans, are guilty of death and destruction causing climate change.
The Beast plays on this vulnerability. And very successfully at that.
To enhance the Green Agenda, the Climate Change narrative, Southern European countries Spain, Greece, Portugal, France, Italy as well as the transatlantic United States are plagued by extreme heat waves, ever-so-often interrupted by deadly flash-floods. In the process, man-made forest fires destroy the forests, the very lungs providing life on earth with oxygen. The purpose is to enhance the Climate Change agenda.
See this 1-min video, how a rescue helicopter sprays fire on forests in Southern Spain, filmed by a fire-fighter. The text is in Spanish, but the video is self-explanatory; no text needed; see this.
The truth is hidden or even censured from us. The universe, including our dear and generous Mother Earth, is never stagnant. She is constantly on the move. Not only physically but also temperature-wise.
Our egocentricity makes us believe that we with our short lives on average less than 100 years makes us the center of the universe, that everything that happens, occurs in our lifetimes, i.e., extreme climate changes / modifications.
For the past about two months the Global North went through record heat waves and record periods without rain. As reported by France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, other countries in Europe, as well as parts of the US, these are heat and dry spells never experienced since weather measurements began, in some countries as early as the 17th Century. In others in the early 20th Century. The relentless heat in Europe, as well as the US, is destroying food crops, contributing to a worldwide food shortage, leading to famine, desperation and eventually death.
As a sub-tentacle of the Beast, more fear, crop loss, famine death.
Although nowhere mentioned, nor proven, this record phenomenon, (yet to fully analyzed and ascertained) appears like engineered weather. It would typically fit into the type of DARPA research and DARPA released technology. DARPA is a Pentagon sponsored thinktank. Modified weather patterns are powerful weapons. They work silently, causing food shortages, famine and death and contributing in more ways than one to the agenda of the Great Reset. See this.
Farmland Reduction A concerted effort of farmland reduction is also part of the Great Reset agenda. Bill Gates is buying up farmland throughout the US and even in other parts of the world. He is said to already own junks of farmland in Ukraine. See this [in German].
By now Gates owns some 300,000 ha of the most productive farmland mostly in the US but also elsewhere in the world.
Farmland owned by Gates will not produce bovine meat, under the pretext of methane gases that contributes to Global Warning. Under Gates concept of food reduction, his farmland may not produce food at all accelerating the Hunger Games.
By the same token, the Dutch Government under the leadership of Mark Rutte, a scholar of Klaus Schwabs Academy for Young Global Leaders, is adamant in reducing Dutch farmland by 30%. The Netherlands is the worlds second largest exporter of agricultural goods, after the United States. See this.
Dutch farmers have been in the streets for the last almost two months to protest their land being forcefully repossessed by the government to reduce the meet output. So far to no avail.
See this.
Curtailment of international transportation 
The airline industry is severely hit by flight reductions, due to largely artificial shortages of personnel and unattractive covid restrictions (a vaxx-must for staff of many airlines). This is said having led to significant flight reductions precisely during the Global Norths summer holidays.
The financial situation of many western airlines is precarious and may become even more so as kerosene / petrol / energy prices keep rising.
The masters of the Great Reset do not want traveling people. They are not as easy to control as are stationary ones.
This tentacle serves at least two purposes: i) it keeps people stationary, more isolated from each other and from global movements; and ii) people who cannot move may be more fearful and better controllable.
Energy Gas, Petrol, Electricity, Shortages
The consequences are multi-faceted. Like climate change, energy shortages affect everything. Our economies growth drive is based on energy. Shortages of energy are leading to recessions, diminishing economic output, reducing the workforce, creating poverty misery, disease and yes, death.
But we are NOT in an energy shortage. An energy shortage is artificially created under the pretext of the Ukraine-Russia war which, in turn, has been created to serve the Great Reset agenda: Massive death, economic collapse, bankruptcies, poverty prompting a shift of assets from the bottom and the center to the tiny elite on top and, accelerating the ascent of an all-digitization from money to the human brain.
But there is no energy shortage. Its all been artificially created by the masters of the WEF, and the Great Reset. See video below.
There are of course, many more tentacles, sub-tentacles and motives for what we are experiencing in the global Norths hot and rainless summer months. But you got the drift. If you consistently ask: Cui bono?- or Who benefits? The answer will lead you always to the same vile octopus with its multiple deadly tentacles, called the Great Reset.
This desired world model described by the WEFs Klaus Schwab et al, is a world towards an ultra-neoliberal system, with largely reduced humans and the surviving ones will have become transhumans (Schwabs term), manipulable by 5G and soon 6G, to be happy owning nothing.
To sum it all up, lets remind ourselves of the dangers related to the all-commanding digital control:
Beware of the QR-Code; Remember Agenda ID2020?
As a final note, a short video (7 min. August 6, 2022) of Dr. Vernon Coleman, about the dangerous new flu-vaxx – if you care for your children, this, as part of a pdf-file inserted in the video:
While you were distracted by Boris [Johnson] resigning, the UK Government quietly confirmed COVID Vaccinated Children are 4423% more likely to die of any cause &amp; 13,633% more likely to die of COVID-19 than Unvaccinated Children.
These are Dr. Colemans final words of advice:
Be Aware. Take Care.
Dont believe what governments say. Warn everyone.
Please remember, you are not alone. More and more people are waking up. And once they are awake, they dont go back to sleep. We are already a far bigger force, than the conspirators would have you believe. If we are going to win this war, then we have to fight with passion, with the truth and we have to fight with determination. No mask, no test, no jab. Dont trust the government; no mass media, and remember we have God on our side.

Aline Oliveira Pezente, a 39-year-old entrepreneur from the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, was working at agriculture company Louis Dreyfus Commodities when she noticed a problem in how the farming industry operates in Brazil. Producers need huge amounts of credit up-front to buy inputs like seed and fertilizer, she says. But lenders are wary given how difficult it is to size up the myriad risks, from the natural -- droughts, floods, crop disease, erosion -- to the financial -- bankruptcy, price crashes and more.In 2018, Aline and her husband Fabricio launched a startup called Traive that collects massive amounts of agriculture-related data, then analyzes it with AI, breaking down the capital risk for lenders and giving farmers easier access to credit.
""Lenders used to each use their own (risk analysis) model. Imagine like a giant Excel file,"" Aline told AFP. ""But it's very hard for humans, even those who are super knowledgeable of statistics and mathematics, to create equations that capture the nuances of all the variables.""They were taking three months to do something that we can do in five minutes with way better accuracy,"" said Aline, who has a master's degree specializing in AI and data analysis from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.- AI for agriculture -Seven years on, Traive's clients include agro-industry giants like Syngenta, fintech firms and Latin America's second-biggest bank, Banco do Brasil.

Speaking alongside her on a panel called ""Harvesting Data: The Next Agricultural Revolution,"" fellow entrepreneur Alejandro Mieses explained how AI has the potential to reshape farming.
Worldwide, farmers are increasingly turning to AI to boost yields and returns, with applications like self-driving tractors, drones that track crop health and smart cameras that recognize weeds for herbicide treatment.
Mieses's Puerto Rico-based startup, TerraFirma, developed an AI model that uses satellite images to forecast environmental risks like natural disasters, crop disease and erosion.
""We insist on the physics of it, because we believe that is the base point. Understanding how water moves, how wind moves, how different solar exposures operate throughout your farmland,"" he said at Web Summit, of which AFP is a media partner this year.

Although farmers tend to be data-obsessed -- painstakingly tracking environmental conditions, inputs and productivity -- gathering and processing that information around the world is complex.
""It's quite resource-intensive. You need servers, you need an immense repository of data,"" said Mieses, 39.
""It's the same old story of garbage in, garbage out.""
- Climate question -
The agriculture industry faces criticism in countries like Brazil, whose rise as an agricultural powerhouse has also seen a surge of environmental destruction in key regions like the Amazon rainforest, a vital resource against climate change.
Innovation optimists argue that, with the world's population expected to reach nearly 10 billion people by 2050, technologies like AI are humanity's best hope for surviving without destroying the planet.

Now, a new crop of Latin American startups is helping do that with artificial intelligence, promising a farming revolution in agricultural giants like Brazil, the worlds biggest exporter of soybeans, corn and beef.
Aline Oliveira Pezente, a 39-year-old entrepreneur from the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, was working at agriculture company Louis Dreyfus Commodities when she noticed a problem in how the farming industry operates in Brazil.
Producers need huge amounts of credit up-front to buy inputs like seed and fertiliser, she says. But lenders are wary given how difficult it is to size up the myriad risks, from the natural droughts, floods, crop disease, erosion to the financial bankruptcy, price crashes and more.
In 2018, Aline and her husband Fabricio launched a startup called Traive that collects massive amounts of agriculture-related data, then analyses it with AI, breaking down the capital risk for lenders and giving farmers easier access to credit.
Lenders used to each use their own (risk analysis) model. Imagine like a giant Excel file, Aline told AFP. But its very hard for humans, even those who are super knowledgeable of statistics and mathematics, to create equations that capture the nuances of all the variables.
They were taking three months to do something that we can do in five minutes with way better accuracy, said Aline, who has a master's degree specialising in AI and data analysis from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
AI for agriculture
Seven years on, Traive's clients include fintech firms and agro-industry giants like Syngenta. Banco do Brasil, Latin America's second-biggest bank, is an investor.
More than 70,000 producers use Traive's platform, which has facilitated nearly US$1bil (RM4.7bil)in financial operations, the company says.

Pratima Harigunani,How India is driving tech developments at G20,"India’s G20 presidency marks an important stride towards establishing a global regulatory framework for the crypto industry, among other tech developments discussed at the global forum in New Delhi this year",https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366552123/How-India-is-driving-tech-developments-at-G20,https://cdn.ttgtmedia.com/visuals/German/article/crypto-mining-adobe.jpg,2023-09-15T08:00:00Z,"India recently hosted the 18th G20 Summit, and corralled all the worlds top leaders under one roof. What was founded in 1999 after the Asian financial crisis as a forum for finance ministers and central bank governors to discuss global economic and financial issues is now held annually as a summit with a broader purpose. It galvanises global political chieftains to mull over crucial macroeconomic issues, including trade, sustainable development, health, agriculture, energy, environment, climate change and anti-corruption.
This year, a lot transpired in New Delhi, particularly with the unfolding of the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor that drives collaboration among the US, India, Saudi Arabia, UAE, France, Germany, Italy and the European Union. 
While there were no major technology-related announcements, a lot of indirect spillovers can be found in discussions on artificial intelligence (AI) and crypto regulations, taking a human-centric approach to technology, digitisation of trade documents and tech-enabled development of agriculture and education.
As a run-up, there were recommendations and policy actions for the business sector, including the Startup20 initiative to support startup companies and the focus on digital public infrastructure (DPI). The summit had also cast the spotlight on climate change commitments, clean energy, and sustainability development goals.
Pradeep Gupta, founder of think tank Security and Policy Initiatives, noted that the emphasis on climate change initiatives at G20 would require IT to play a role in areas like equipment, data management and analytics. Carbon credits cannot function without good AI and data technology in place, he said. DPI will also be a big lever for the industry.
V K Sridhar, an assistant professor at the department of mechanical engineering at Gandhi Institute of Technology and Management in Hyderabad, agreed that IT will be instrumental in driving all the climate change agreements that emerged at this G20 both from a technology and administrative point of view. Collective efforts are critical in this area, he said.
Another big ripple from G20 is in AI. Devroop Dhar, co-founder and managing director of Primus Partners, a consulting firm, pointed out the potential of AI in building DPIs. India has built various DPIs focused on areas such as health, education and identity management, and has the potential of taking these solutions to other countries, especially to the Global South.
To Sachin Panicker, chief AI officer at Fulcrum Digital, a technology consultancy, the most significant takeaway was the collective acknowledgment of the paradigm-shifting potential of generative AI. Prime minister Narendra Modis proposal to establish a comprehensive framework for responsible, human-centric AI governance resonates deeply with the technical community, emphasising the critical need for ethical AI deployment.
And while doing so, countries will have to balance the need to regulate AI and spur the technologys future development. There is a general understanding that while some form of regulation is needed, it should not throttle innovation, said Dhar.
The regulation should facilitate movement towards ethical and safe use of AI and help mitigate the challenges around bias, data models, deep fakes and intellectual property. All of these need a global approach with a common framework and guiding principles being followed and countries learning from each other.
Efforts to bridge data gaps and gain insights on the use of digital assets for payments was another significant development, said Rahul Pagidipati, CEO of ZebPay, adding that it will enable policymakers to adopt an informed and analytical perspective when formulating regulations.
Impact on crypto and telcos
Pagidipati noted that Indias G20 presidency marked an important stride towards establishing a cohesive global regulatory framework for the crypto industry, adding that the initiation of crypto-specific discussions at the international level underscores the countrys dedication to nurturing a secure and innovative digital economy.
Richard Teng, head of regional markets at Binance, welcomed the crypto policy roadmap presented by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Stability Board (FSB), in collaboration with various international organisations and standard-setting bodies.
He acknowledged the recent developments at the G20 meeting where member nations called for the swift implementation of the Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) and amendments to the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), emphasising the importance of implementing a reporting framework for crypto assets. This marks a significant step forward in the global regulatory landscape for crypto and the overall Web3 industry under Indias G20 leadership, said Teng.
Also, as noted by Mahendra Nahata, managing director of network equipment supplier HFCL, the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Bharat 6G Alliance and the Next G Alliance, operated by the Alliance of Telecommunications Industry Solutions, is a first step towards deepening public-private cooperation between telecoms suppliers and operators.
Execution is key
While progress has been made at this years G20, Gupta called for countries to work together to implement what has been decided. We must carry it forward in execution till we reach the next table in Brazil, he said.
The next G20 Summit will be held in Rio de Janeiro in November 2024.
Biswajit Maity, principal analyst at Gartner, said the global collaboration during the G20 summit benefits the Indian IT sector in a number of ways, including increased market opportunities, fostering shared technological insights, and attracting greater foreign funding.
In addition to strengthening Indias IT standing in the global market, such synergies also contribute to the development of innovative solutions to shared challenges, he said. In addition, it will aid regional IT companies in facilitating their global expansion. While we see the intention and substance are evident, successful execution is going to be key.",,ComputerWeekly.com

Fabio Teixeira,News24 | Can Brazil's farmers grow more soy without deforestation?,More farmers in Brazil are restoring depleted land in order to grow soy and avoid deforestation.,https://www.news24.com/fin24/climate_future/news/can-brazils-farmers-grow-more-soy-without-deforestation-20231008,https://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9525/142d794ea2e342e6bf4173a6ab95b238.jpg,2023-10-08T06:39:37Z,"<ul><li>There is growing global concern about deforestation to make way for soy farming in Brazil.</li><li>However more farmers are working to regenerate depleted land to grow their soy crop.</li><li>Brazil has about 100 million hectares in degraded pastures that could potentially be brought back into production for soybeans.</li><li>For climate change news and analysis, go to News24 Climate Future.</li></ul>
When Brazilian farmer Ricardo Santinoni first planted soybeans in the central state of Goias, he could only afford to sow about 70 hectares. Two decades on, he has 1 000. And he did it without cutting down a single tree.
The land Santinoni took over from his father was a degraded cattle-grazing pasture - once part of Brazil's vast Cerrado tropical savanna - cleared decades ago and then abandoned when it became unproductive.
But over the years, Santinoni and his partner Fernanda Ferreira, an agronomist, have gradually brought it back to a fertile condition by rotating other crops such as corn or beans and grazing cattle on it to enrich the soil with manure.
""I see myself as a small part of a giant whole,"" Santinoni told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in his office at the Morro do Peao farm, gesturing to a red plaque hanging on the wall that sums up their mission: ""Feed Life in a Sustainable Way.""
Soy farming, closely linked to deforestation, has seldom been synonymous with sustainability, but Santinoni said more and more farmers were working to regenerate depleted land instead of expanding the agricultural frontier.
Their push reflects growing global concern about deforestation to make way for the crop in Brazil, the world's biggest producer of soy - used to feed Europe's livestock and make cooking oil for big Asian markets such as India and China.
READ |Tree-hugging AI to the rescue of Brazilian Amazon
In 2006, soy traders voluntarily agreed to stop buying soy from areas deforested in the Amazon after a certain date. Since then, soy farming has expanded rapidly in other areas including the Cerrado, where environmental advocates want a similar pact.
Goias is Brazil's third-largest soy-producing state. Cities like Pires do Rio - where Morro do Peao is located - are encircled by farmland where soy, corn and other crops are grown year-round on rolling plains that stretch toward low hills on the horizon.
During the dry months from May to September, the rural landscape turns yellow and brown after the main soy crop has been brought in, withered stems littering the parched soils.
But at Morro do Peao, in August, there is still plenty of green from beans in some fields and from grass in others, where the farm's roughly 1 000 cattle graze.
Pointing to the verdant fields around him, Santinoni said no rain had fallen here for three months.
""I'm contributing a lot to the sustainability of the planet with the practices we have on the property,"" the 49-year-old said after wrapping up a weekly meeting with his employees that focused on reducing waste and keeping the farm clean.
An overview of the challenges and opportunities of the climate crisis, as it changes the world we know.

Food vs nature
Brazil has overtaken the US in recent years as the world's biggest soy producer, with its farmers gathering a record 2023 harvest of 155 million tonnes, according to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).
About 45 million hectares - an area roughly the same size as Sweden - are used to grow the oilseed.
But on top of that, Brazil has about 100 million hectares in degraded pastures, according to a government estimate, lands that could potentially be brought back into production for soybeans or other food crops.
While land regeneration has been done for decades in the country, the practice has gained traction as an alternative to clearing more land for agriculture as governments around the world seek to tackle global warming.
WATCH |Rainforest countries form pact to demand conservation cash from rich nations
Deforestation is fuelling climate change impacts - including harsher heat, drought and floods, which can slash harvests and spur new pests, posing a growing threat to global food security.
That makes efforts like land regeneration that seek to balance nature protection and farming all the more urgent, especially in areas like the Cerrado - the world's most biodiverse savanna - where deforestation has been rising.
Brazil's government announced plans in July to create a fund for restoration. The aim is to gather about $120 billion from investors, which would allow for 40 million hectares to be restored over the next decade, according to an August report in business newspaper Valor Economico.
""We have the technology to make these areas productive again,"" said Marcia Mascarenhas Grise, a researcher at Embrapa, Brazil's agricultural research corporation.
""We don't need to open new areas (for agriculture).""
Stopping deforestation
At Morro do Peao, soy yields have steadily ticked up despite reductions in the use of chemical fertilisers, illustrating the effectiveness of their approach, Ferreira said.
In 2004, they harvested an average of 49 60kg sacks of soybeans per hectare. Now, they gather 75 sacks per hectare and hope to reach 100 sacks by 2026.
Crop rotation is central to their land management technique, and the practice includes planting grass for cattle grazing - saving on feed and keeping the animals healthier, Ferreira said as she walked in the fields alongside the cattle.

Restoring land and increasing productivity is vital to avoiding further deforestation, said Priscila Souza, head of policy evaluation at the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI), a nonprofit that works in Brazil alongside PUC-Rio, the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro.
Continued tree clearance in the Amazon even poses a threat to the country's agricultural production by leading to lower rainfall in key soy-growing areas in the south of the country, CPI/PUC-Rio research has found.
""In the 2021/22 agricultural year, we had such a severe drought that (insurance claims) increased almost four-times compared to the previous harvest,"" Souza said.
But despite the promise of land restoration as way to protect Brazil's forests, she said government assistance will be needed, especially for small-holders who tend to have less capital and technical expertise.
""For small-holders, restoration is uncertain and costly,"" she said.
Cultural change
Even without direct government incentives, it often makes economic sense for Brazilian farmers to restore their lands, and investment firms have started looking for opportunities.
""There's a very simple explanation for that: it's a lot cheaper for a farmer to convert a degraded area than to open a new (legally deforested) one,"" said Pedro Henrique de Alcantara, an analyst at Embrapa.
Paramis Capital, a Brazilian financial services company, is structuring a 500-million reais ($100.6 million) fund to buy up degraded land and restore it.
Structuring funds to buy up land is not uncommon, but usually firms just buy land and then lease it back to farmers, said Silvio Valle, from Paramis.
But Paramis aims to restore and manage the land itself through a partnership with Fisalis, a resource management firm that specialises in agricultural assets.
""Our thesis is transformational: we are taking up land that yields 20 sacks (of soy) per hectare, and improving that to 60 sacks,"" said Ricardo Scaff, an agricultural engineer and partner at Fisalis.
""It's like buying an old house, renovating it and selling it. It's better than buying and renting,"" Scaff added.
For Santinoni, the shift towards greater sustainability on his farm marks a turning-point amid growing international pressure over deforestation and reflects a change in thinking among a new generation of farmers.
It is also about farmers' financial survival, he said, with diminishing soy yields eventually making growers uncompetitive.
""The market itself will drive him out.""",news24,News24

DRIVING THE DAY
NEW JMART COLUMN Jonathan Martin goes inside the RON DeSANTIS campaign in Tallahassee and brings back this scoop-studded report:
Gathered around a conference table at the Florida Republican Partys headquarters here late last month, Gov. Ron DeSantiss inner circle did little to hide their eagerness to get into the presidential race or mask their frustration over the rising skepticism about their candidate-in-waiting 
[T]he aides working for the former Yale baseball player dont want their phenom to be judged before he even steps into the batter box, to stretch the metaphor. Thats why they invited me to Tallahassee.
DeSantiss high command recognizes that the catnip-for-junkies national polling has shifted toward [DONALD] TRUMP this year, but they believe they retain a fundamental advantage. The majority of the Republican Party wants to move on, said GENERRA PECK, DeSantiss campaign manager and closest aide.
BIDEN BRACES FOR TITLE 42 BACKLASH Title 42 ended at midnight. For more than two years, immigrant rights advocates have been pressuring President JOE BIDEN to undo the Trump-era pandemic policy that allowed the federal government to send asylum seekers back to Mexico. (Previously, asylum seekers who crossed the southern border illegally could wait in the U.S. while their cases were pending.)
With the Covid emergency now officially over, theres no justification for the policy. But its demise may create a surge of migrants, and the Biden administration is trying to return to what it views as a more humane asylum policy without encouraging an unmanageable stream of migrants that becomes both a humanitarian and political crisis.
As the clock expired on Title 42 last night, Homeland Security Secretary ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS released a tough statement on the Biden administrations new enforcement efforts.
Starting tonight, people who arrive at the border without using a lawful pathway will be presumed ineligible for asylum. We are ready to humanely process and remove people without a legal basis to remain in the U.S. We have 24,000 Border Patrol Agents and Officers at the Southwest Border and have surged thousands of troops and contractors, and over a thousand asylum officers to help enforce our laws. Do not believe the lies of smugglers. The border is not open. People who do not use available lawful pathways to enter the U.S. now face tougher consequences, including a minimum five-year ban on re-entry and potential criminal prosecution. Together with our partners throughout the federal government and Western Hemisphere, we are prepared for this transition.
TITLE 42 READS 
THE PLAYBOOK INTERVIEW: HENRY CUELLAR The border-state Democrat has a lot to say about the Biden administrations record on immigration.
Cuellar was born to immigrant farm workers in Laredo, Texas, went to college and law school, eventually jumped into Texas politics and, in 2004, was elected to Congress. His district, the Texas 28th, stretches from San Antonio to Laredo and includes 200 miles of the southern border.
The first thing you notice when visiting Cuellars office in Rayburn are the letters PhD after his name on the plaque next to his door. His parents drilled into him the importance of education, and hes never stopped going to school. He likes to point out that hes got more degrees than anyone else on the Hill: an A.A, a B.S., an M.A., a J.D., and that PhD. (Hes currently studying at the Naval War College for another degree.)
The left does not like him. In the last two election cycles, he was targeted by national progressives and barely survived primary challenges. One reason: immigration an issue where he is well-known for being to the right of many of his Democratic colleagues. Hes also been frustrated with Biden, who he thinks has been too captured by their partys liberal wing on this issue. (Though he voted, along with every other House Democrat, against the border security bill that House Republicans put on the floor yesterday.)
Cuellar is a lonely centrist on an issue that has become much more polarized over the last decade. And he thinks Joe Biden should join him in the middle and stop taking advice from the left, as the president braces for the coming aftershocks of his Title 42 decision.
You can listen to the full interview on the Playbook Deep Dive Podcast. What follows are some key excerpts.
On the buses of migrants being sent from Texas to big cities up north:
The buses that theyre sending to D.C. or Chicago or New York are just a drop of what a border community [sees] and theyre already complaining. Theyre already complaining. Theyre talking about sending buses from New York City to other places! I had that position way before DeSantis was governor that was back in 2014. Its different when it happens in your own backyard.
On the resentment directed at new migrants by Hispanics:
A lot of first-generation Americans mainly Hispanics in South Texas theyre saying: Hold it. We and our parents came in through a long process, [a] legal process. And theyre seeing people just come through the border. It causes a little resentment. And I emphasize the word resentment, because a lot of first-generation Hispanics did it the right way.
On how Biden is perceived in border communities:
We at the border, we always smile: Every time theres a new president, its one extreme the other way and then another extreme when it deals with the border. Trump comes in, separates kids wants to build a wall and all that one extreme. Then the impression in my area is Bidens [going] the other way: Hey, let everybody in even though they say dont let anybody in. When you say the borders not open, but youre watching, and people are just streaming in? I mean, let me ask you: What was the last time you saw somebody being deported?
On the shift Biden is attempting:
Politically, now the presidents trying to move to the center when it comes to immigration policies I think a little bit too late, but theyre moving to the center now.
On the political salience of images from the border:
You open up the newspaper. You turn on the TV and [listen to the] radio whatever the case. They see this every day. So that gets ingrained in their minds. . The image, you know, is powerful. What were seeing at the border is powerful. When I see this affecting folks [who] are not political at all but are worried about it that has to have an impact. And if we start losing Democrats to the Republicans, they feel were not doing the job and securing the border or we start losing the independents because the Independents were with Biden. He doesnt want to lose those Independents.
MEANWHILE Our colleague Brittany Gibson reports this morning that some progressive groups are thinking about taking another swing at Cuellar in 2024. NARAL Pro-Choice America, the abortion rights advocacy group, told POLITICO that it is committed to removing Cuellar from office. JOEL PAYNE, chief communications officer at MoveOn.org, didnt rule out spending on a primary. Other progressive organizations indicated that they may jump in again, too.
I think that appetite has turned more into a raging starvation, a Democrat who worked for multiple campaigns in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas last cycle told Brittany.
Happy Friday. Thanks for reading Playbook. Drop us a line: Rachael Bade, Eugene Daniels, Ryan Lizza.
A message from PhRMA: 
Middlemen like PBMs are charging fees tied to the price of medicines, which means they make more money when the price of a medicine goes up. This business model allows PBM profits to soar and can lead to higher costs for patients. Its time to lower costs for patients by holding middlemen accountable.

BIG ATLANTIC READ The Abortion Absolutist, by The Atlantics Elaine Godfrey: WARREN HERN has been performing late abortions for half a century. After Roe, he is as busy with patients as ever.
LET THE DEM FREAKOUT COMMENCE For more than a year, Biden and his allies have been singing the same tune about the 2024 election: The world doubted us before, and well prove them wrong again. That conviction has only been fortified by the last two years, as major legislative strides and a better-than-expected midterm came in the face of routine skepticism.
But as Bidens campaign gears up, other Democrats are warning that the past cannot be considered prologue and theyre concerned the presidents team might be a touch overconfident about a Biden-Trump rematch.
The problem isnt just anemic poll numbers.
Top officials privately have expressed anxiety about the state of the presidents reelection operation, Eugene and Jonathan Lemire report. Currently, there is no headquarters and only a handful of full-time staffers in place, not one of which is a finance director. The presidents political team refuses to discuss its fundraising numbers in public, sparking anxiety among donors that the number is underwhelming and could continue to lag as the summer months approach.
This weeks bruising ABC-WaPo poll has some little to repair the frayed nerves among Bidens allies.
The ABC poll, while it is an outlier, its also a warning, right?said TERRANCE WOODBURY, CEO of HIT Strategies, a progressive polling firm. They are a very confident White House. Hes passed some damn good legislation. But that aint always good politics.
Aides close to Biden bristle at the criticism and even the critics themselves, arguing their track record should earn them the benefit of the doubt.
If youre the sort of coward whod rather throw stones at the people wrestling with the devil than at the devil himself, and who has no comparable record of success, it makes sense youd confuse strength with overconfidence, one 2020 Biden campaign alum told POLITICO. Reporters arent your therapists, kids.
Other Biden world officials insist they are taking nothing for granted, pointing out a bolstered DNC is handling the lions share of the work, while still others think that theres nothing that Biden world could do differently that would quash the angst that is practically part of the partys DNA.
Democrats are bedwetters, historically, said JIM MESSINA, who managed BARACK OBAMAs reelection campaign.Theres like, just full-throated fucking panic.

CONGRESS
WHOS AT DEFAULT Biden and the Big Four congressional leaders are delaying their previously scheduled Friday meeting on the debt limit to give staffers more time to work on details, WaPos Paul Kane and Tyler Pager were first to report.
So what does the delay mean for the talks? Hard to say. One GOP lawmaker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private talks, said the meeting had been postponed because discussions among staff members had been moving too slowly, Kane and Pager write. Another person familiar with the matter disputed that, saying that the delay is a positive development that gives staff members more time to prepare options for the president and congressional leaders.
Meanwhile, our colleagues Sarah Ferris and Katherine Tully-McManusreport this morning that the flurry of negotiations on both the leadership and staff level look more and more like they could end in a spending-caps deal, a bargain not unlike the one that ended the 2011 fiscal cliff standoff between Republicans and then-President Barack Obama.
Sarah and Katherine note that the biggest obstacle to such a deal may be length, with House Republicans thinking much more long-term than Biden and his Democratic negotiators. White House officials are privately aiming for a two-year deal that would lift the debt limit and impose new limits on discretionary spending, while McCarthys camp made clear Thursday that theyre dreaming much bigger 10 years, to be precise.

2024 WATCH
TRUMP TRIES AGAIN CNNs Trump town hall offered a peek at Trumps second-term vision, NYTs Shane Goldmacher, Jonathan Swan, Maggie Haberman and Stephanie Lai write. The gist: Its a sharp departure from core American values that have been at the bedrock of the nation for decades: its creditworthiness, its credibility with international allies and its adherence to the rule of law at home.
Notable quotable: From my perspective, there was an evolution of Donald Trump over his four years, with 2020 I think being the most dramatic example of him the real him, former Trump Defense Secretary MARK ESPER told the Times. And I suspect that would be his starting point if he were to win office in 2024.

THE WHITE HOUSE
FIRST IN PLAYBOOK Yesterday, White House chief of staff JEFFZIENTS met with student loan forgiveness advocates from 17 organizations to discuss ongoing efforts on debt relief and higher education priorities, according to a person familiar with the meeting.
One attendee said they left feeling reassured that Zients understood the stakes of the issue and was taking it seriously. (Loan forgiveness advocates had a good relationship with Bidens first chief RONKLAIN, and some were unsure if that high level access would continue under his successor.) The meeting comes just weeks before expected rulings from the Supreme Court on two challenges to Bidens student loan forgiveness plan.

We may now be at these crossroads. The Beast is Rising. But its Fall is in sight.
We have to understand, the Beast is Big. Its Huge. Its so extraordinarily big, humanity has never faced something like it in recorded history.
So, we better are properly prepared.
Imagine, a small handkerchief or a pocket-square (a tiny decorative lapel accessory) is sitting on a huge quintuple king-size bedsheet, aiming at controlling the bedsheet. Thats the globalist Cult Elite, aiming at converting the world population into a One World Order (OWO). It will not happen. Its an image so absurd that could have only emerged form a megalomaniac which is what the WEF and its Master, Klaus Schwab, and his behind the scene money masters are.
No matter, how powerful they think they are, tyrannizing the world at large into their slaves, We, the People, will make sure it will not happen. Fissures in the OWO ranks are already clearly visible.
The new motto is bye-bye OWO-Globalism and welcome to the new multipolar world.
Actually, a world that is gradually becoming an east-west polarization, with a west that is ever faster decaying in more ways than one monetary-wise, in term of political ethics, as well as faltering support from western and hitherto western-leaning governments and, at least, by two thirds of western people, who vehemently oppose their governments.
Mind you, we are not quite there yet at the point of western collapse.
However, the crack in the wall, where the light shines through [paraphrasing a famous Leonard Cohen song] gives enormous hope for the light to prevail.
The Big Picture what is it?
The Big Picture has three major branches, three major objectives of the Beast to fulfill. Imagine the Beast as a multiple-tentacled Monster-Octopus. Listed not necessarily in order of priority, but rather as a simultaneous bulldozing approach, they include:
i) Massive depopulation, genocide, worldwide; an eugenist agenda on which the Gates and Rockefellers et al, have worked already for decades, and already their predecessor generations were obsessed with eugenics. Less people, less useless eaters and consumers of scarce, unrenewable resources. So bluntly presents it Yuval Noah Hariri, Israeli intellectual and close adviser to Klaus Schwab, the WEFs eternal CEO;
ii) Shifting assets from the lower and middle echelons to the top the elite, billionaires, individuals, as well as corporate finance, such as BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street; others may include Fidelity, City Bank, Bank of America and many more.
The first three alone are interlinked as shareholders and can act as one, controlling an estimated 25 trillion dollars, worldwide, giving them a leverage power of way above US$ 100 trillion (compared to the worlds GDP of about US$ 90 trillion), thereby having virtual control over every country on the globe, and
iii) Digitization of everything, connecting everything with everything, eventually with the mega-powerful ultra-shortwaves 5G and soon to come 6G. Through these electromagnetic waves, they may access our brains. Its Klaus Schwabs pipedream. It includes digital worldwide unform vaxx-passes, managed through the infamous QR-code, or similar, with practically illimited info-storage capacity.
Currently it has a potential of storing more than 30,000 pieces of information about each one of us. Those who manage the QR-code, know you better than you know yourself. It is an updated version of Bill Gates Agenda ID2020.
Digitization may, as a first step, include an under-the-skin chip on every surviving citizen currently being volunteer-practiced in some Nordic countries, like Sweden and Denmark, storing and monitoring every piece of info about you, incl. health records, bank accounts, with whom you talk, where you travel, where and what you shop and-and-and you got the picture.
Later, it will likely just be an electronic fingerprint in the form or capacity of a QR-code or its successor, that is engrained in our bodies through an electromagnetic field which is being injected into our bloodstream graphene oxide, for example under the pretext of covid vaxxes, or eventually any vaxxes invented and forced upon the population.
The next one may be the new flu-vaxx already announced as a novelty, practically untested, but ready for the fall season. Be aware and beware!
Digital money, already largely dominating the Global North, will become the norm by the end of Agenda 2030, or sooner if WE, the People, do not stop it. And yes, we can. Digital money would make us to digital slaves; digital money could be blocked at will by the Cult Cabal, or outright stolen, depending on our behavior.
No worries, according to Klaus Schwab, we eventually will own nothing but will be happy  thats the paraphrased ending of the Great Reset. Our mind will no longer think independently, but 5G and the graphene oxide injected by the covid and other vaxxes still to come, will make from humans so-called transhumans (expression used by Klaus Schwab in an interview in 2016 with the Swiss French TV), basically useless and dispensable slaves, since robots and Artificial Intelligence (AI) will have taken over human roles.
These goals are all addressed in one way or another in the WEFs Great Reset. It may be worth your while to have a glance at it. Most libraries contacted, answered with a smile, they dont carry the book; theyd rather not associate with this monster plan.
Here is the Amazon link for The Great Reset.
The globalist agenda is gradually disintegrating. See this on the anti-globalist trend of the WEF in Davos, May 2022.
Yet, the globalists keep fighting on. A hopeless game. But they may be able to extend their globalist drive for a while, with perpetual lies, untold riches of immorally and largely illegally acquired financial wealth, possibly bringing about millions of victims and, God forbit leading into WWIII, potentially meaning a hard-core nuclear war.
The Beast is still on the rise. That does not mean it is winning.
Many of us may not notice. It is discrete, but deadly. In all its discretion, it keeps announcing what it is planning, what is in store for humanity. The Cult, the Luciferian Cult, to which the Beast likely belongs, in order to succeed, has to announce its action well in advance. Lest they, the Cult, may not prosper.
The Cults Warnings
The Cult has repeatedly warned us throughout the last at least 50 years. It has always told us well-in-advance wat they and their minions were planning. And this with increasing intensity in the last two to three decades. Just a few examples. Most of us have conveniently ignored their warnings.
The 1992 Earth Summit in Rio  official name United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 3-14 June 1992. It was based on the Club of Romes (in)famous 1971 publication Limits to Growth, A Simulation Model of World Population, Environment and Economics. The model predicted a looming environmental disaster in the coming 50 to 100 years, i.e., beginning just about now.
The Club of Rome, alias the Earth Summit, gave the impetus for what is today known as the Global Warming cum Climate Change Agenda with its commercial side-kick, the New Green Deal.
You must know, the Club of Rome was not a European invention, as the name may have you believe. It was a Rockefeller initiative.
9/11 was the deadly, violent event to announce a new era  an era of increasing to total control, depriving personal liberties, restrictions with often denigrating and embarrassing airport security checks. A few weeks after the well-organized horrendous 9/11-devastation, the Patriot Act was passed through Congress. It had been prepared way before 9/11. It deprives US citizens of nearly 90% of their human and citizen rights.
Similar emergency type laws were passed with ease in Europe and other so-called western countries, referring to countries following the US political and monetary doctrine. Most of the Global North, or the West (also including, Australia, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand), currently lives under some kind of an emergency legislation, largely circumventing their Parliaments for matters that deal with the Great Reset Agenda.
Most of their populations have no clue that their Parliaments have been partially disabled.
The 2010 Rockefeller Report depicts the contents of the UN Agenda 2030 in four Chapters. The first one describes the Lockstep scenario. Pretty much what the world, the 193 UN member countries, went through after the worldwide declared lockdown for the covid-19 plandemic. In lockstep, every government followed the same human rights destroying stern rules, instilled and coerced by fear, dictated by WHO. See this full 2010 Rockefeller Report  chapters The Scenario Framework and the Scenario Narratives are of particular interest.
Bill Gates TedTalk February 2010 in San Diego  he advocated:
If we are doing a real good job (vaccinating], we may reduce world population by 10% to 15%.
This was just a trial balloon to gauge peoples reaction.
It was also an announcement of things to come. As we know by now the ultimate target of world population is something of the order of half a billion people as indicated on the Georgia Guidestones which have recently been vandalized. No worries, the cabal will not reach that mass-genocide target. But it has already done immense harm, and if not stopped, will continue killing people, many in the most atrocious ways.
WHO declares in 2014 the decade of vaccination  referring to the decade of 2020 to 2030, i.e., the UN Agenda 2030. Did anybody pay attention? How did WHO know? Maybe Bill Gates was whispering the orders in the WHO halls where donations are collected. Conveniently, any reference to this WHO warning has disappeared form internet.
June 2016 the Swiss Gotthard tunnel inauguration  a bizarre Luciferian Celebration, depicting lockstep Luciferian sex-dances and strange killings and deaths remotely related to tunnel construction. Full of symbolism.
Googles explanation  While tunnels certainly represent journeys, they more often symbolize the passage from one phase of life to another. In its most primal meaning, the tunnel symbolizes the birth canal. Just as a baby evolves and journeys outward, so do characters of a story.
See also this 6-min. Gotthard Tunnel inauguration video clip.
It is certainly a passage through darkness. No surprise. Not evil or Lucifer ever projected a world of light for us, the common people. All to the contrary, the more obscure they keep us, the more fear they instill, the more control they gain. And that is what seems they want to play out. To no avail. They wont succeed.
Event 201 of 18 October 2019 in NYC  The Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in partnership with the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation hosted Event 201, a high-level pandemic exercise on October 18, 2019, in New York City.
The Events website describes the exercise as an aera where public / private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large-scale economic and societal consequences. The real object of the exercise was just the opposite, via a corona virus.
By coincidence, a few weeks later, at the beginning of 2020, a corona-virus broke out, called SARS-Cov-2, alias Covid-19. WHO declared it a pandemic on 11 March 2020, when reported deaths, worldwide, were fewer than 5000. Knowing what we know today, one may ask: How reliable are these death reports then and today?
Compare this with 52,000 flu-related deaths in the US during the 2017 / 2018 flu-season. The common flu was never declared a pandemic. See this.
We are now being warned about the impending food shortages, energy shortages that will bring about a cold winter, famine; plus, a sizable recession preceded by horrendous double-digit inflation that in turn will trigger bankruptcies, unemployment, poverty, misery and more deaths.
The Beasts ascent is not undisturbed. There are forces pulling in other directions, attempting pulling it down, sideways and outright apart. The massive crack in the wall, that lets the Light shine through, is getting bigger and bigger. Once the light reaches a sufficient amount of people, a critical mass the Beasts reign may be getting close to an end.
We are not there yet. Unfortunately. But we must think positive. Inspiring each other spiritually. Creating a mental and spiritual togetherness. We, the Awakened People, can bring this diabolical era to an end.
Following the lead mentioned above, the Beast may be depicted as a multiple-tentacled Monster-Octopus. Each tentacle has its deadly mission. Many tentacles have sub-tentacles. In case a tentacle is defeated the others will fight on, and the defeated one will grow back with even greater vigor. Thats the concept.
We have to be aware and conscious of these multiple-scenarios and the Big Picture they constitute, so as not to allow our attention to being deviated by one single scenario for example, the plandemic and vaxx narrative. Though, admittedly important, it ought to be connected to all other tentacle-scenarios, lest we miss the overall objectives of The Great Reset Agenda, alias UN Agenda 2030.
We want to stop this human-made criminal Outbreak of misery and death as a whole, in its entirety. If we do it by compartment, our chances to overcome the Beast are largely diminished. The Cult Cabal counts on us being distracted by one or two tentacles, while the others keep laboring ahead almost undisturbed reaching gradually their goals.
It is utterly important that we are aware that all the tentacles are connected. There are no coincidences; and there is no single frontline in this war. The entire humanity, no matter where we are on this globe, is the frontline. That also means, there is no escape.
Unless, and this is crucial, we wake up. This is our escape. We, the People, see the light, and ascend to another level where the darkness of the Beast cannot reach us anymore. We need a critical mass for our Peoples Power to be strong enough, to pull us, humanity, through and collectively onto a different, higher and enlightened plane.
To do that, for those who are awake, who see the Beast, who see the tentacles and their machinations as killing machines, it is utmost important that we always see the overall objective of the Great Reset, the UN Agenda 2030, and the 4th Industrial Revolution, hence, the Big Picture.
When we fight one tentacle, say, the covid narrative, an important one, we must always remember that there are others, and that covid is only one cog in the wheel, in the gear of the Reset destruction.
The covid tentacle has many sub-tentacles: Big Pharma is one; the vaxx-mandate is another one; the useless and socially degrading forced mask-wearing, social distancing, and home-office work, are all ways of humiliating, separating and isolating individuals. And so forth. They all play nicely into each other, enhancing each other, psychologically, by FEAR, and physically, by various forms of other than covid diseases, i.e., all types of cancers, leukemias, liver-kidney and heart failures and much more; all potentially deadly. Indeed, they have already caused exponentially more deaths than the covid-plandemics is said to have caused.
It would, therefore, be unwise to put all our scientific knowledge into the vaxx debate, or the covid infection  is it real, or isnt it? It doesnt matter. But by doing just this, we are playing into the devils hands.
While it is a must to identify the covid fraud describing the scam scientifically by medical doctors, virologists and other scientists, but it is by far not enough.  The public at large must understand the cheat, so they may be able to shed off the immune system destroying fear.
Overall objectives of the Reset are in plain view. Therefore, we must expose and connect the Cults covid fraud and the fear it causes, to all other tentacles of the Octopus-Beast. We must fight the entire GREAT RESET Narrative as a whole and in solidarity.
Other Tentacles of the Octopus-Beast
Fear, already mentioned before, is yet another deadly tentacle. It is well known in psychology, that fear the constant tension of fear lowers our auto-immune defense. It renders us increasingly vulnerable to all kinds of diseases, including a myriad of different cancers and diseases of our vital organs. They all may lead to death, at which point it will be next to impossible to trace the cause of disease and death back to the poisonous covid-vaxx.
Fear is one of the Beasts strongest weapons. Not only does it destroy our natural immunity, fear makes us blind and obedient. Blind to our own human rights. For fear, we give them up, hoping the Beast will safe us. Instead, we are becoming slaves slaves to our governments, who are, in turn, the servants of the WEF and the Beast.
Climate Change  the ever-most ferociously propaganda-pushed agenda that the planet will heat up, that we humans are the culprits, as we use excessive amounts of fossil fuel, creating so-called greenhouse gases, driving world temperatures through the roof. As mentioned above, this is the continuation of the Rockefeller-initiated Club of Rome agenda to enslave the (western) world through guilt.
We, of the western / Global Norths Judo-Christian beliefs or cultures, are beset by guilt, as part of our guilt-driven up-bringing.  Its part of our religious cum cultural inheritance. So, we are extremely vulnerable when told that we, humans, are guilty of death and destruction causing climate change.
The Beast plays on this vulnerability. And very successfully at that.
To enhance the Green Agenda, the Climate Change narrative, Southern European countries Spain, Greece, Portugal, France, Italy as well as the transatlantic United States are plagued by extreme heat waves, ever-so-often interrupted by deadly flash-floods. In the process, man-made forest fires destroy the forests, the very lungs providing life on earth with oxygen. The purpose is to enhance the Climate Change agenda.
See this 1-min video, how a rescue helicopter sprays fire on forests in Southern Spain, filmed by a fire-fighter. The text is in Spanish, but the video is self-explanatory; no text needed; see this.
The truth is hidden or even censured from us. The universe, including our dear and generous Mother Earth, is never stagnant. She is constantly on the move. Not only physically but also temperature-wise.
Our egocentricity makes us believe that we with our short lives on average less than 100 years makes us the center of the universe, that everything that happens, occurs in our lifetimes, i.e., extreme climate changes / modifications.
For the past about two months the Global North went through record heat waves and record periods without rain. As reported by France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland, other countries in Europe, as well as parts of the US, these are heat and dry spells never experienced since weather measurements began, in some countries as early as the 17th Century. In others in the early 20th Century. The relentless heat in Europe, as well as the US, is destroying food crops, contributing to a worldwide food shortage, leading to famine, desperation and eventually death.
As a sub-tentacle of the Beast, more fear, crop loss, famine death.
Although nowhere mentioned, nor proven, this record phenomenon, (yet to fully analyzed and ascertained) appears like engineered weather. It would typically fit into the type of DARPA research and DARPA released technology. DARPA is a Pentagon sponsored thinktank. Modified weather patterns are powerful weapons. They work silently, causing food shortages, famine and death and contributing in more ways than one to the agenda of the Great Reset. See this.
Farmland Reduction  A concerted effort of farmland reduction is also part of the Great Reset agenda. Bill Gates is buying up farmland throughout the US and even in other parts of the world. He is said to already own junks of farmland in Ukraine. See this [in German].
By now Gates owns some 300,000 ha of the most productive farmland mostly in the US but also elsewhere in the world.
Farmland owned by Gates will not produce bovine meat, under the pretext of methane gases that contributes to Global Warning. Under Gates concept of food reduction, his farmland may not produce food at all accelerating the Hunger Games.
By the same token, the Dutch Government under the leadership of Mark Rutte, a scholar of Klaus Schwabs Academy for Young Global Leaders, is adamant in reducing Dutch farmland by 30%. The Netherlands is the worlds second largest exporter of agricultural goods, after the United States. See this.
Dutch farmers have been in the streets for the last almost two months to protest their land being forcefully repossessed by the government to reduce the meet output. So far to no avail.
See this.
Curtailment of international transportation
The airline industry is severely hit by flight reductions, due to largely artificial shortages of personnel and unattractive covid restrictions (a vaxx-must for staff of many airlines). This is said having led to significant flight reductions precisely during the Global Norths summer holidays.
The financial situation of many western airlines is precarious and may become even more so as kerosene / petrol / energy prices keep rising.
The masters of the Great Reset do not want traveling people. They are not as easy to control as are stationary ones.
This tentacle serves at least two purposes: i) it keeps people stationary, more isolated from each other and from global movements; and ii) people who cannot move may be more fearful and better controllable.
Energy Gas, Petrol, Electricity, Shortages
The consequences are multi-faceted. Like climate change, energy shortages affect everything. Our economies growth drive is based on energy. Shortages of energy are leading to recessions, diminishing economic output, reducing the workforce, creating poverty misery, disease and yes, death.
But we are NOT in an energy shortage. An energy shortage is artificially created under the pretext of the Ukraine-Russia war which, in turn, has been created to serve the Great Reset agenda: Massive death, economic collapse, bankruptcies, poverty prompting a shift of assets from the bottom and the center to the tiny elite on top and, accelerating the ascent of an all-digitization from money to the human brain.
But there is no energy shortage. Its all been artificially created by the masters of the WEF, and the Great Reset. See video below.
There are of course, many more tentacles, sub-tentacles and motives for what we are experiencing in the global Norths hot and rainless summer months. But you got the drift. If you consistently ask: Cui bono?- or Who benefits?  The answer will lead you always to the same vile octopus with its multiple deadly tentacles, called the Great Reset.
This desired world model described by the WEFs Klaus Schwab et al, is a world towards an ultra-neoliberal system, with largely reduced humans and the surviving ones will have become transhumans (Schwabs term), manipulable by 5G and soon 6G, to be happy owning nothing.
To sum it all up, lets remind ourselves of the dangers related to the all-commanding digital control:
Beware of the QR-Code; Remember Agenda ID2020?
As a final note, a short video (7 min. August 6, 2022) of Dr. Vernon Coleman, about the dangerous new flu-vaxx if you care for your children, this, as part of a pdf-file inserted in the video.
While you were distracted by Boris [Johnson] resigning, the UK Government quietly confirmed COVID Vaccinated Children are 4423% more likely to die of any cause &amp; 13,633% more likely to die of COVID-19 than Unvaccinated Children.
These are Dr. Colemans final words of advice:
Be Aware. Take Care.
Dont believe what governments say. Warn everyone.
Please remember, you are not alone. More and more people are waking up. And once they are awake, they dont go back to sleep. We are already a far bigger force, than the conspirators would have you believe. If we are going to win this war, then we have to fight with passion, with the truth and we have to fight with determination. No mask, no test, no jab. Dont trust the government; no mass media, and remember we have God on our side.

Animal hoarding disorder (AHD) is classified as a psychiatric obsessive-compulsive condition characterized by animal accumulation and often accompanied by unsanitary conditions and animal cruelty. Although AHD may increase pathogen transmission and spread, particularly for zoonotic diseases, human and dog exposure in such cases has yet to be fully established.

Although all the human samples were 2ME-MAT negative, 12/264 (4.5%, 95% Confidence Interval: 2.07.0%) dog samples were 2ME-MAT and LFIA positive, with 2ME-MAT titers ranging from 20 to 640. At least one dog in 4/21 (19.0%, 95% CI: 2.046.0%) households was seropositive. Despite the absence of seropositivity in individuals with AHD and the comparatively low seroprevalence in dogs, B. canis circulation and outbreaks should be considered in such human populations due to the high burden and recurrent character of B. canis exposure in high-density dog populations and the constant introduction of susceptible animals.

Introduction
Animal hoarding disorder (AHD) is defined as a psychiatric obsessive-compulsive condition characterized by the accumulation of animals in households, frequently in high numbers and confined to small spaces and lacking minimum nutrition, physical space, sanitation, and veterinary assistance [1,2]. Individuals with AHD often live in unsanitary conditions, leading to vector proliferation and pathogen spread, particularly of zoonotic diseases [1,36]. In addition, such individuals often fail to recognize animal suffering, are often hungry, trapped, crowded, or even die [1], as indicated by case reports of dogs scavenging the owners remains [7].
In a One Health approach, AHD should be considered beyond simple ownership of multiple pets, as this practice impacts the health, welfare and safety of owners themselves, their animals, their families, the environmental health of their households and the surrounding community [3,5].
Canine brucellosis, a zoonotic disease caused by the intracellular bacterium B. canis that has spread worldwide and is considered endemic in Brazil, is the main cause of infection in domestic dogs, mainly leading to reproductive failure and infertility, with reports of human infection [816]. B. canis may insidiously infect dogs and cause intermittent bacteremia for months or even years, causing dogs to become a continuous source of infection [13,17,18]. In such a scenario, dogs may become a potential risk for humans and other animals, in addition to posing an occupational risk for veterinarians, laboratory-handling personnel and breeders [12,19,20].
As B. canis may persist in prostate and lymphoid tissues, neutering may only prevent semen contamination and not eliminate infection [13,16,17,18]. Human infection has rarely been reported, partially due to the absence of investigations, with many endemic countries reporting no data and a lack of active surveillance to pinpoint the actual prevalence [12,15,17,21,22]. Clinical signs are nonspecific, transient, and often similar to those of influenza virus infection [16,17,19,21,23]. Concomitant detection of human and canine B. canis infections has been rare, as reported in Colombia and South America [11] and in case reports in New York City, USA [23]; Argentina, South America [24]; and the Netherlands [25].
Although markedly neglected, canine brucellosis has not been included in the list of mandatory notification diseases by the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) [14,26]. In addition, underdiagnosis may occur due to low suspicion, as dog reproductive failure and abortion may not be considered primary signs for brucellosis diagnosis by veterinarians (and owners physicians) [9,13,15].
The prevalence of dog anti-B. canis antibodies in Brazil has varied from 5/175 (2.9%) in Paraná state [27] to 7/106 (6.6%) in Rio de Janeiro state [28] and 16/254 (6.3%) to 39/254 (16.5%) in Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo states (depending on the test used) [29] to 23/32 (71.8%) in São Paulo state [30]. Despite the close contact of humans with dogs under poor sanitary conditions, the lack of veterinary and nutritional care and the susceptibility to zoonotic diseases [5], no study has been conducted among individuals with AHD and their companion dogs for B. canis infection. Accordingly, this study aimed to assess the seroprevalence of anti-B. canis antibodies and molecular B. canis detection in individuals with AHD and their dogs in Curitiba, the eighth largest Brazilian city, which has 1.8 million habitants.
Materials and methods
Ethics statement
This study was approved by the Animal Use Ethics Committee (protocol number 077/2015) and by the National Human Ethics Research Committee (protocol number 3,166,749/2019) through the Federal University of Paraná, southern Brazil.
Study area
This study was conducted in Curitiba (25°2547"" S and 49°1619"" W), the capital of Paraná state and the eighth largest city in Brazil, which has more than 1.8 million habitants [31] and a high Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI) of 0.823, ranked 10th out of 5,568 Brazilian cities [31,32]. Fully covered by urban areas, with a subtropical climate and the highest and coldest Brazilian capital (among 27 total), Curitiba has an average annual temperature of 16.5°C and an altitude of 945 m above sea level [32].
Sample collection
As a previous study reported, at least 65 residences with animal hoarding cases within Curitiba city limits were found, corresponding to 724 dogs [33]. A random sample calculation with a confidence level of 95% and an accuracy of 5% resulted in a minimum sampling of 251 dogs, sampling the largest possible number of dogs in each household for convenience, to assess the brucellosis seroprevalence in this population.
Blood sampling of dogs was carried out in 2017 at each residence and officially conducted by the City Secretary of the Environment. For legal reasons, human blood sampling was conducted in 2019, officially conducted by the City Secretary of Health.
All individuals were first informed about this study, invited to voluntarily participate, signed an informed consent form, responded to an epidemiological questionnaire, and then were subjected to blood sampling through cephalic puncture by certified nurses. Blood was collected from the dogs after the owners provided consent through jugular puncture by certified veterinarians.
Epidemiological data and statistical analysis
For statistical purposes and due to exposure to the same accumulation conditions, all people and dogs residing in the households were considered hoarders and hoarding dogs, respectively, regardless of the exposure period prior to sampling. Signed informed consent was obtained before sampling by signing the Owners Consent Term, with all procedures performed in compliance with the National Human Ethics Research Committee for the use of human data and samples.
Serological analyses
2-Mercaptoethanol microplate agglutination test (2ME-MAT).
Dog and human serum samples were screened for anti-B. canis antibodies by the 2-mercaptoethanol microplate agglutination test (2ME-MAT) according to the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health &amp; Safety (ANSES, Maisons-Alfort, France) protocol, which is the national/European Union/WOAH (World Organization for Animal Health) reference laboratory for brucellosis [34]. The B. canis antigen 2ME-MAT was an inactivated suspension of B. canis that contained 4.5% cellules and 0.5% formaldehyde and was derived from the B. canis M-strain (nonmucoid strain). Serial dilutions from 1:20 to 1:640 were applied, with serum samples considered positive if antibody titers were 20 for B. canis [17], and final titers were determined at the last dilution with complete agglutination.
Lateral Flow Immunoassay (LFIA).
Serum samples seropositive for 2ME-MAT were tested by a commercial lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) for the qualitative detection of B. canis antibodies (Antigen Rapid C. Brucella Ab Test Kit, BioNote, Inc., Republic of Korea) [35,36].
Molecular analyses
The seropositive samples for anti-B. canis antibodies were also molecularly tested by conventional PCR. DNA from each blood sample was extracted using a commercially available kit (Relia Prep gDNA Tissue Miniprep SystemPromega, USA) and tested by conventional PCR for Brucella spp. detection using a standard protocol (ITS66: ACA TAG ATC GCA GGC CAG TCA and ITS279: AGA TAC CGA CGC AAA CGC TAC), as previously described [8]. After PCR, the samples were analyzed in 1.5% agarose gel by electrophoresis and stained with SYBR Safe DNA gel stain. DNA bands were visualized under UV light.
Results
Although all 65 residences were visited within a year, dog sampling was allowed by residents only for 21 households, for a total of 264 dog samples. All people living in the 21 households were approached; however, blood samples were available from only 19 people from 11 households, and these individuals were fully evaluated.
No individual with AHD (0/19) was seropositive according to 2ME-MAT for anti-B. canis antibodies. Seropositivity for anti-B. canis antibodies by 2ME-MAT were observed in 14/264 (5.3%; 95% CI: 2.68.0%) dogs, with titers ranging from 20 to 640. At least one seropositive dog was found in 5/21 (23.8%, 95% CI: 5.642.0%) households, with the proportion of positive serological dogs per household ranging from 2/17 (11.8%) to 6/16 (37.5%).
All 14 dogs seropositive according to the 2ME-MAT were tested by LFIA, with 12/14 (85.7%) remaining seropositive. Thus, considering the two techniques (2ME-MAT and LFIA) together as a positive serological diagnosis, 12/264 (4.5%, 95% CI = 2.07.0%) dogs were seropositive in 4/21 (19.0%, 95% CI = 0.236.0%) households. These 14 seropositive samples were also tested by conventional PCR for Brucella spp., with no positive reaction (Table 1).
The majority of the tested individuals with AHD were women (13/19), most of whom were elderly (9/13), with ages ranging from 66 to 86 years.
Overall, seropositive dog samples were equally distributed between males and females (six each), with ages ranging from 1 to 16 years and dogs mostly living freely in the yard (9/12). In one household, two seropositive dogs lived in a collective kennel (Table 2).
Discussion
The present study is the first comprehensive investigation of B. canis exposure in individuals with animal hoarding disorder (AHD) and their dogs. Considered a challenging diagnosis, B. canis exposure should be ideally detected by an association of different direct and indirect tests [13,17,26,28,37], such as 2ME-MAT and LFIA performed in the present study. Despite the reports of bacterial isolation as the gold positive standard and its use for early detection (2 weeks after bacterial contact), diagnosis requires laboratories with biosafety level 3, high cost, and high handling risk [15,16,38]. Although no diagnostic test has been considered solely satisfactory for assessing B. canis exposure, 2ME-MAT may be the choice for screening large populations [13,21], as it provides positive results 24 weeks after exposure [39]. For humans, we used the same diagnostic tests, as there are no approved tests for the diagnosis of B. canis to date [26].
Serological diagnosis of B. canis exposure may be even more relevant in this study, as individuals with AHD may experience self-health degradation [40] and poor perception of their animal and environmental health deterioration. Despite living in close contact with animals, clinical signs of dog brucellosis, such as abortion, may be ignored, unnoticed and unreported by elderly individuals with AHD, as reported in other low-income populations [41,42]. Although all individuals with AHD tested in our study were seronegative for Brucella spp., human exposure and outbreaks caused by B. canis have been reported [24,43]. A previous study revealed 4.6% (8/174) of individuals seropositive for B. canis from the slum community of Salvador, northeastern Brazil, related to the ongoing increase in the stray dog population [43]. A B. canis outbreak involving a female dog with her three puppies and three children and three adults was reported in Argentina in 2009. Humans exhibited fever, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly after close daily contact with the animals [24]. In addition, an unapparent B. canis infection was reported in kennel employees, suggesting the occupational risk of exposure [44]. Despite the positive outcome, human serological results should be cautiously interpreted, as the diagnostic techniques may vary and not be standardized, even in dogs [26].
The prevalence of anti-B. canis antibodies in dogs found in this study (4.5%) was within the range of those in previous surveys, from 5/175 (2.9%) [27] to 7/106 (6.6%) [28], which are all much lower than the 23/32 (71.8%) found in São Paulo state [30]. The last study focused on a population with a history of miscarriages, a history of failed conceptions, and characteristics of canine brucellosis [30]. As expected, the 4.5% dog overall seropositivity was lower than the per household seropositivity (11.8% to 37.5%), which may indicate that large unassisted dog populations living in confined places contributed to the transmission of B. canis, similarly observed in overpopulated kennels [17,30]. Furthermore, despite the absence of seropositivity in individuals with AHD and the comparatively low seroprevalence in dogs in the present study, B. canis outbreaks should be considered in such human populations due to the high burden and recurrent character of B. canis circulation in high-density dog populations and the constant introduction of susceptible animals.
These findings in dogs highlight human vulnerability as a risk factor for brucellosis, as has been observed for other zoonotic diseases in homeless, indigenous, and quilombola communities [4548]. In addition, negative results for individuals with AHD may indicate that B. canis has the lowest zoonotic potential in the genus Brucella [12,17]. Nonetheless, seropositive dogs in close and continuous contact with owners with AHD, mostly elderly, unassisted (last medical visit over 6 months prior), lonely and with comorbidities [1,6], may be a tragic combination.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been commonly used to confirm Brucella species [10] and as a useful confirmatory test in seropositive dogs [8,16,49]. However, nondetection of DNA in seropositive samples for anti-B. canis antibodies may be the result of intermittent bacteremia and intracellular characteristics, leading to low diagnostic sensitivity [15].
Hoarding disorder cases are challenging mostly due to neglect, the multiplicity and complexity of associated factors [5], and difficulty accessing affected populations [7]. A recent study in the Metropolitan Region of Curitiba, Paraná, indicated challenges faced by the City Hall official services regarding animal hoarding disorders, such as the lack of standardization and exchange of service information between the involved city secretaries, including health, environment, and social services [50]. As a consequence, cases become chronic, with worsening of accumulation and consequences, particularly zoonoses.
B. canis is transmitted mainly through contact with tissues and secretions from contaminated reproductive organs of dogs [11,13,16,19]. Although the pathogen has also been found in whole blood [16], this may not be the best sample for DNA detection by PCR. Thus, negative PCR results for blood samples in this study may not be indicative of the absence of infection.
As a limitation of this study, no sampling was performed for tissues, saliva, nasal or genital secretions, or urine, particularly following reproductive problems, which would have increased the diagnostic sensitivity [16]. Furthermore, access to and monitoring of households of individuals with AHD was limited by the classic refusal to receive help characteristic of the AHD population, which also impacted the low sampling of individuals with AHD in this study. Furthermore, the sampling dates used were different for dogs and individuals with AHD in compliance with different time permits from the ethics committee of animal use and the city secretary of health, which may have impacted the results due to potential dynamics over time in B. canis exposure. In addition, the epidemiological questionnaires failed to include important questions on associated risk factors for B. canis exposure, such as serology following reproductive failure or molecular testing of abortion tissues.
Conclusion
The present study is the first to assess brucellosis in a vulnerable population as a silent disease based on the environment and susceptible population. Despite the absence of seropositivity in individuals with AHD and the comparatively low seroprevalence in dogs, B. canis circulation and outbreaks should be considered in such human populations due to the high burden and recurrent character of B. canis exposure in high-density dog populations and the constant introduction of susceptible animals. In conclusion, serological and molecular assessments of vulnerable populations, particularly those with silent diseases, may serve as the basis for public health policies, including systematic diagnosis, control, monitoring, and prevention.

Introduction
Yellow Fever virus (YFV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes symptoms including fever, muscle pain, nausea, and fatigue. Although many people recover from initial symptoms of yellow fever, approximately 15 percent of infected patients experience more severe infections including hemorrhage, jaundice, and damage to multiple organ systems [1], with case fatality rates exceeding 40% [2]. Globally, approximately 400 million people are estimated to be at risk of YFV [3]. Although widespread vaccination campaigns have reduced the burden of YFV circulation, several epidemics and epizootics have occurred in South America during the last two decades, primarily in Brazil [4]. In the Americas, YFV predominantly circulates in a sylvatic transmission cycle involving non-human primates and canopy-dwelling mosquitoes of the Haemagogus (Hg.) subgenus Haemagogus [5]. During recent YFV outbreaks in Brazil, Hg. janthinomys and Haemagogus (Conopostegus) leucocelaenus (Dyar &amp; Shannon, 1924) were implicated as the primary vectors [5]. Contemporary human YFV outbreaks represent spillover events from this sylvatic cycle into the human population [6].
Mayaro virus (MAYV) is a recently emerging arbovirus with a sylvatic transmission cycle throughout Central and South America that occasionally spills over into human populations in Brazil, Bolivia, and Venezuela [7]. While MAYV is not known to be fatal, it can cause non-specific febrile symptoms, and occasionally results in debilitating polyarthritis or polyarthralgia [8]. Although the precise burden of MAYV is unknown, human seroprevalence surveys have detected MAYV circulation in many countries including Peru [9], Suriname [10], Mexico [11], Colombia [12], French Guiana [13], and Haiti [14]. Canopy-dwelling, Haemagogus janthinomys Dyar, 1921 is among several mosquito species that are considered important vectors of both YFV and MAYV [15].
Haemagogus janthinomys is typically collected in primary rainforest habitats and larvae are typically found in tree holes [15,16]. Adults typically do not fly far from breeding sites in tree canopies where they will feed on non-human primates and other mammals [16]. This species has also been observed to take bloodmeals from up to three different host species in a single ovicycle [17]. Plasticity in host selection, particularly within a single ovicycle could increase chances for zoonotic spill over. Haemagogus janthinomys will also descend to the forest floor to feed opportunistically on hosts such as humans [16]. Other Haemagogus spp. are known vectors of sylvatic yellow fever, however Hg. janthinomys appears to have the widest geographic range across central and South America [18]. There does appear to be some plasticity in the feeding behaviors and geographic distribution across central and South America which may indicate this species is actually a complex with cryptic taxa confusing biological observations [19].
A comprehensive understanding of the geographic distribution of Hg. janthinomys mosquitoes is essential to predicting areas at risk of MAYV and YFV outbreaks. However, it is infeasible to exhaustively survey this species across its entire range, due to site inaccessibility and extensive resource allocation requirements of time, labor, and surveillance equipment. Knowledge of the ecological niche preferences of this species can guide disease surveillance efforts and aid public health authorities in allocating resources for vector control measures. Ecological niche modeling (ENM) techniques have been used extensively to predict the potential range of disease vectors [20], including vectors of Rift Valley fever virus, Trypanosoma cruzi [21] and Japanese encephalitis virus [22], among others. Although several modeling studies have used ENM frameworks such as the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach to predict the geographic range of the Mayaro [23] and yellow fever viruses [24] and an important YFV vector, Hg. leucocelaenus [25], there have been very few recent attempts to model the habitat suitability of one of the major vectors, Hg. janthinomys. This study aims to develop a robust species distribution model of Hg. janthinomys using a comprehensive dataset of collection records compiled from publicly accessible databases and peer-reviewed literature.
Methods
Occurrence and background points
Distribution data for Hg. janthinomys were compiled from publicly available specimen collection records, archive specimens in the United States National Museum (USNM) mosquito collection, and records reported in peer-reviewed scientific literature. A search of the VectorMap data repository (vectormap.si.edu) yielded both collection locations from USNM specimen records and mosquito surveillance data. Additional collection events were identified from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) database [26] and the NCBI GenBank database [27].
A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Searches were executed using the keywords Haemagogus janthinomys combined with each country in South America, including Trinidad and Tobago, for all articles published between 1901 and December 20, 2020. Trinidad and Tobago was included as it is listed as the type locality of Hg. janthinomys. The search scope was modified to exclude Central American countries after initial searches yielded very few collection records from the literature.
Articles were considered for eligibility based on the following criteria: (i) original research studies on arthropod vectors in South America that described field-collected Hg. janthinomys adult mosquitoes, larvae, or pupae or original research studies that described the bionomics of Hg. janthinomys; and (ii) studies that included mappable collection sites (either GPS coordinates or specific named places that can be georeferenced). Articles were not included if they met any of the following exclusion criteria: (i) studies involving only humans; (ii) studies not reporting original data (e.g., review articles, perspective pieces, editorials, recommendations, and guidelines); (iii) duplicate studies; (iv) laboratory-based vector competence studies or studies involving laboratory-reared mosquitoes; (v) studies that did not provide exact collection site locations; (vi) studies that did not provide information on mosquito identification methods.
All articles were organized using EndNote, and data was abstracted into a Microsoft Excel table. A primary reviewer (MC) independently screened all titles and abstracts to determine articles that could immediately be discarded and articles to be included in the second stage of review. During this second stage of review, full text articles were reviewed to identify candidates for inclusion in the study. A secondary reviewer (AP) examined the screening results to verify the final list of eligible articles. From those studies that met our inclusion criteria, collection data were extracted focusing on all information relevant to preserving the collection event [28]. Locality data for each collection event was georeferenced using the point-radius method [29] and data was standardized using the WRBU/VectorMap Best Practices Guide to Data Management and Reporting [30]. All duplicate coordinates were removed from the dataset. In addition, the spThin package in the R statistical software was used to reduce clustering of presence records [31]. A 1-km distance threshold was used to ensure that no more than one presence point occurred within each pixel of the environmental rasters. See the S1 Table for a full list of sources, collection dates, and coordinates for each collection location.
A fundamental assumption of ENMs is that species occurrence records are collected through systematic or random sampling (i.e., unbiased samples) [32], but this assumption is often violated when certain areas are oversampled because they are more easily accessible [33]. This spatial bias can reduce model accuracy because environmental features of these more accessible areas are overrepresented in the model, leading to issues like artificial clustering due to the uneven sampling effort [34] and errors of omission or commission [35]. One solution to correct for sampling bias is the selection of background points with the same selection bias as the presence points [33]. MaxEnts default procedure is to select background points at random from the study extent [32]. However, we generated a bias file using the MASS package in the R statistical software to ensure that the background sampling represented the record density of the occurrence points. As a result, background points were chosen preferentially from areas with a high density of presences. We used MaxEnts default setting to select 10,000 background points during the modeling process.
Variable selection
A total of 32 topographic, climate, and landscape variables were considered for inclusion in the model. The 19 bioclimatic variables from the WorldClim version 2 website were downloaded at a 30 arc-second (~1km) spatial resolution [36]. The Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data (GMTED) slope and elevation datasets were downloaded from the ESRI Living Atlas of the World database at a 7.5 arc-second (~250m) spatial resolution [37]. The Food and Agricultural Organizations Digital Soil Map of the World was downloaded at a spatial resolution of 5 arc-minutes (~8km) [38]. Three additional raster layers were created from the initial elevation raster using the flow direction, flow accumulation, and aspect tools from the ESRI ArcGIS Pro Spatial Analyst toolbox [39]. Aspect was transformed to Northness (calculated as cos(Aspect)) using Raster Calculator in ArcGIS Pro [34].
Several variables derived from NASAs Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing platform [40] were also considered for our model. This data was provided by the Malaria Atlas Project (https://malariaatlas.org/). Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data and landcover classification data at 2.5 arc-minute (~5km) resolution were accessed from MODIS MCD43D62-68 and MCD12Q1 products, respectively [41,42]. The annual, gap-filled [43] EVI raster layers spanning the years 20002020 were used to calculate two synoptic raster layers representing the EVI mean and standard deviation over this time period. In addition, we considered proportional land cover variables for four land cover types that may influence the Hg. janthinomys distribution: evergreen broadleaf forest, savannas, grasslands, and urban/built up. Annual land cover layers spanning the years 20002020 were used to calculate synoptic raster layers representing the mean proportional land cover for each land cover class. Finally, we considered a categorical land cover raster representing the dominant land cover class within each raster grid cell. Land cover classes were based on the International GeosphereBiosphere Programme (IGBP) classification scheme.
A complete list of the raster layers considered for the model is included in the S2 Table. All raster layers were clipped to the extent of South America (15.925°N, 55.983°S, 109.458°W, 28.841°E), re-sampled to a 1000m resolution using bilinear interpolation, and transformed to the WGS 1984 World Mercator projected coordinate system using the Extract by Mask function in ArcGIS Pro. However, it is important to note that resampling of coarser spatial resolution data to the final 1000m spatial resolution did increase the spatial resolution of the variables but did not increase the precision of the data [44]. Country shapefiles were accessed through the geoBoundaries Global Administrative Database [45].
Covariate significance assessment
A covariate significance assessment was conducted on the sample record collection dataset in order to develop a more refined, statistically robust ENM [46]. Covariate significance was assessed via the t-test and r2-maximization criteria at the 95% confidence level ( = 0.05). Number density was used as the dependent variable, and three multiple least-squares regression models were developed and tested to evaluate the linear and quadratic terms of each covariate: 1) a linear-only (LO) model using the linear terms of each covariate; 2) a quadratic-only (QO) model using the quadratic terms of each covariate; and 3) a linear-quadratic (LQ) model that incorporates both the linear and quadratic terms of each covariate. Covariates were tested for correlation/collinearity as part of the covariate significance assessment. Covariates that are directly correlated with other covariates were removed prior to the covariate analysis. For example, bioclim7 was removed due to correlation/collinearity with bioclim5 and bioclim6 (Table 1). As part of the multiple linear and quadratic regression analysis, the correlation coefficient (r) was calculated between each pairwise combination of covariates as an indicator of their degree of correlation (e.g., -1 = high negative correlation; +1 = high positive correlation; 0 = no correlation); and 2-D covariate and correlation matrices were generated that summarize these r values. In addition, a Comparison of Regressions analysis was conducted to assess for significant differences among the correlation coefficient (r), regression slopes (of each covariate in the regression equation), elevation (or regression intercept), and coincidental regression among the regression equations, for each of the regression models (LO, QO, LQ).
The Multiple Addition (MA) and Multiple Removal (MR) methods were used to sequentially add and remove, respectively, one covariate at a time to and from the developing regression model, and to assess the statistical significance of the covariate addition/removal at each successive step. In the MA process, covariates were sequentially added in the order of highest to lowest significance until all significant (P &lt; 0.05) covariates were added. In the MR process, covariates were sequentially removed in the order of lowest to highest significance until all insignificant (P &gt; 0.05) covariates were removed [46]. A total of six optimal model runs were conducted: three models (LO, QO, LQ) by two sequential methods (MA, MR). A covariate was labeled as significant if at least one of its terms (linear or quadratic) was retained in at least one of the six optimal models (to establish consensus among models).
To assess model variance, the r2 and adjusted r2 values were calculated at each sequential step to generate plots of these variance measures as a function of the number of covariates terms (N) in the given regression model. Generally, r2 increases with an increase in the number of covariate terms (N) in the model, whereas the adjusted r2 either increases or decreases. A decrease in adjusted r2 with an increase in N reflects the importance of the penalty function (a warning indicator of over-parameterization) offsetting any increase in explained variance obtained by adding the additional covariate term. In any model adjustment, in which covariate terms are added to or removed from the model, tradeoffs exist between r2-maximization and covariate significance (ability to explain a significant proportion of variance source, as quantified by r2, the correlation coefficient r, and P-value). The model exhibiting maximum r2 (typically the model with the most covariate terms) is not necessarily the optimal model, especially in cases with relatively small sample sizes, since theres a potential risk of over-parameterization (low degrees of freedom or difference between sample size and number of model adjustable parameters). Furthermore, in over-parameterized models, adding additional covariate terms does not significantly improve model fit (increase r2), and the average variance source explained by each covariate term in the model is usually relatively low, compared to models with fewer but more significant covariate terms.
Bilinear interpolation was used to estimate covariate values at each sample record collection data point by overlaying the covariate raster grids on the sample data points, identifying the 1-km resolution grid-box that each sample data point resides in, converting the geographic coordinates of the sample data point and four corner points of the grid-box to easting-northing, and calculating spatial distances as the basis for interpolation.
Model settings and performance
The MaxEnt approach to developing ENMs has emerged as one of the most popular techniques for species distribution modeling due to its high predictive accuracy [47] and low sensitivity to sample size [48]. MaxEnt is widely used due to its ability to model complex relationships and interactions between predictors and to avoid overfitting using regularization [48,49]. The MaxEnt technique uses presence-only collection data and a suite of relevant covariates, contrasting environmental conditions at presence points against randomly selected background points [32]. Comparative modeling studies have demonstrated strong performance of the MaxEnt algorithm [50,51]. MaxEnt has also performed well even with a limited sample size [48].
MaxEnt version 3.4.1 was used to generate a distribution map of Hg. janthinomys habitat suitability using topographic, landscape, and climate variables. An output format of cloglog was selected, which returns an estimate between 0 and 1 that represents the habitat suitability within each pixel [52]. The model was run using the k-fold cross validation replicated run type with 20 replicates. For this validation procedure, the data set is split into k independent subsets (i.e., folds), and the model is trained on k-1 subsets and validated using the kth subset [32]. Therefore, each replicate in our model was trained on approximately 90% of the occurrence records and validated using approximately 10% of the occurrence data. In addition, the maximum iterations were set to 10,000 and all other settings were left as their defaults. Features were selected automatically based on the findings of a similar study that reported improved model performance with automatic feature selection versus manual selection [53]. The jackknife test as well as the percent contribution and permutation importance were used to assess the relative importance of each variable in the model. The permutation importance is calculated by randomly permuting the values of each variable on training presence and background data and then reevaluating the model on the permuted data. The resulting drop in training AUC is calculated for each variable, with a greater decrease indicating greater importance of that variable. In order to perform the jackknife procedure, the MaxEnt program runs several models where each variable is omitted in turn, followed by additional models where each variable is used in isolation to predict the species distribution.
The model was run with the significant variables identified from the covariate analysis. The area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) was used to assess model performance, based on the average AUC across the 20 model replicates. An AUC of 1 suggests that the model perfectly predicts the distribution of the vector while an AUC of 0.5 suggests that the model is not able to predict the distribution better than random chance. We used the AUC of test data (AUCTEST) to assess model performance instead of the AUC of training data (AUCTRAIN) due to the problems of overfitting associated with the AUCTRAIN statistic [54].
Results
Haemagogus janthinomys collection data
Overall, 177 unique geolocations of verified Hg. janthinomys presence from 11 countries in South America (including Trinidad and Tobago) were documented, with most records from Brazil (n = 122), French Guiana (n = 20), and Colombia (n = 11) (see Fig 1 and Table 1). Within Brazil, the majority of collection events were recorded in the states of Amazonas (n = 20), Rio de Janeiro (n = 16) and Para (n = 14). Overall, the dates of collection ranged from 193536 to 20192020. The majority of collection events (n = 127) occurred since the year 2000. After thinning the collection events to ensure that no more than one record coincided with each 1-km pixel in the environmental rasters, 34 records were dropped. Therefore, 143 presence points and 10,000 background points were used to develop the ENM. A complete list of collection events is included in the S1 Table.
Covariate selection
Nine continuous covariates were selected for inclusion in the final ENM based on the covariate significance analysis: BIO1 (annual mean temperature), BIO2 (mean diurnal range), BIO5 (maximum temperature of warmest month), BIO6 (minimum temperature of coldest month), BIO9 (mean temperature of driest quarter), BIO14 (precipitation of driest month), BIO15 (precipitation seasonality), BIO19 (precipitation of coldest quarter), and the categorical land cover class (See Table 2 for variable descriptions). These nine variables were labeled as significant because at least one of their terms (linear or quadratic) were retained in at least one of the six optimal regression models. The BIO15 and land cover variables were retained in four of the optimal models while BIO14 and BIO19 were retained in three of the optimal models. BIO5 was retained in two of the optimal models while BIO1, BIO2, BIO6, and BIO9 were each retained in one optimal model. In addition, a tenth variable, EVI, was included in the model due to the influence of vegetation on the mosquitos abundance [5558]. Although this variable was initially discarded based on the results of the covariate significance assessment, we felt that the inclusion of EVI would improve the accuracy of the final model.
The minimum, maximum, and average values of the nine continuous variables were extracted at each Hg. janthinomys collection point. The results are presented in Table 2 along with the percent contribution and permutation importance of each variable according to the MaxEnt model. The average value for the five temperature variables at the Hg. janthinomys collection points were: 24.3°C (average annual temperature), 9.5°C (mean diurnal range), 30.8°C (max. temperature of warmest month), 17.4°C (min. temperature of coldest month), and 23.5°C (mean temperature of driest quarter). The average value for the three precipitation variables at the Hg. janthinomys collection points were 55.3mm (precipitation of driest month), 56.6% (precipitation seasonality), and 475.5mm (precipitation of coldest quarter) while the average EVI value was 0.4. Finally, the most common land cover class across the collection points was evergreen broadleaf forest (n = 55).
Ecological niche model
The habitat suitability map for Hg. janthinomys is presented in Fig 2 and a map of the model uncertainty (i.e., standard deviation) for the 20 replicate runs is presented in Fig 3. The suitability map represents the average of the 20 replicate runs incorporating the nine most significant variables identified by the covariate significance assessment and the additional EVI variable that was included in the model. The average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for testing data (AUCTEST) across the 20 model replicates was 0.84 (SD±0.07). The analysis of variable contribution (see Table 2) demonstrated that the mean diurnal range contributed the greatest amount of information to the model (41%), followed by land cover (32.1%), and the maximum temperature of the warmest month (15.8%). Similarly, the jackknife tests of both training gain and test gain revealed that these same three variables were the most important variables for developing the ENM. In other words, these variables increased the training/test gain most substantially when used in isolation and decreased the training/test gain most substantially when omitted from the model. In addition, the permutation importance was greatest for average annual temperature (34.8%) followed by mean diurnal range (31.6%).
The response curves for each covariate are presented in Fig 4. These curves represent the dependence of the predicted suitability on each variable, based on a MaxEnt model created using only the corresponding variable. The response of Hg. janthinomys to the variable with the greatest percent contribution (mean diurnal range) demonstrated optimal conditions at a lower temperature range, followed by a steep decline as the range increased. The response to the maximum temperature of the warmest month showed an increase in suitability as temperature increased with a peak at 31°C followed by a steep decrease. In addition, the response to the categorical land cover variable demonstrated that the urban/built-up land cover class was highly suitable for Hg. janthinomys presence. Finally, the response to annual average temperature revealed a steady increase across values that peaked around 24°C, followed by a steep decline. The response curves for the remaining variables are presented in Fig 4.

The ENM suggested that the regions with greatest Hg. janthinomys habitat suitability can be found in the coastal states of Brazil, including Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Sao Paulo, etc. High suitability for Hg. janthinomys presence was also apparent on the Western coast of Colombia (especially in the departments of Choco and Narino) and in several states of Ecuador and Venezuela. The majority of Trinidad and Tobago was found to be highly suitable in addition to the coastal regions of Guyana and French Guiana.
Discussion
This study has produced a comprehensive database of Hg. janthinomys collection events as well as a predicted distribution of Hg. janthinomys habitat suitability. Using the MaxEnt modeling software, we successfully developed a distribution map which provides a contemporary prediction of the mosquitos potential ecological niche, incorporating the publicly available records of Hg. janthinomys presence. As an important vector of YF and MAY viruses, it is crucial for health planners to be informed of where this species may contribute to human infections across South America. The model may guide surveillance activities for Hg. janthinomys by identifying high suitability regions for vector presence.
MaxEnt provides the opportunity to develop ENMs using a relatively small number of collection records. However, the paucity of high-resolution geographical distribution data for Hg. janthinomys is important to consider when evaluating this model. Our model predicted the potential ecological niche of the Hg. janthinomys mosquito with an AUC of 0.84, demonstrating several regions of high suitability throughout South America. These findings are consistent with an ecological niche model published in 2010, which found optimal conditions for Hg. janthinomys along the coast of northeast Brazil and northern Venezuela, based on 78 presence records [18]. Our model included several important variables related to the mosquitos distribution (e.g., EVI and categorical land cover) that were not included in the previous model [18]. Furthermore, we have included a bias layer to account for sampling bias during the selection of background points. Although our expanded distribution dataset provides a more contemporary prediction of Hg. janthinomys niche, additional collection data from a wider geographic range is greatly needed.
Our model may serve as an important tool for public health authorities concerned with the spread of MAYV. Although MAYV outbreaks have only occurred sporadically, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has emphasized its growing importance and recommended increased surveillance and enhanced diagnostic capacity [59]. Our model identified areas of high suitability for Hg. janthinomys, the primary MAYV vector, in the urban coastal region of French Guiana, which aligns with recent epidemiological findings. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that 11 of 13 confirmed MAYV cases diagnosed in 2020 occurred among residents of the urban coastal areas [60]. Additional locations of MAYV outbreaks in Para, Brazil [61,62] and Portuguesa, Venezuela [63] have also occurred in regions of moderate-to-high suitability for the vector according to our model. During a major outbreak of MAYV in the town of Belterra, Brazil, Hg. janthinomys mosquitoes were identified as the principal disease vector [64], highlighting the importance of this mosquito in the MAYV transmission cycle.
Haemagogus janthinomys has also been identified as an important vector during outbreaks of sylvatic YFV in Brazil over the last several decades [5,6567]. During the most recent outbreak (201618), 20 pools of Hg. janthinomys were positive for YFV out of 162 pools tested overall and the minimum infection rate (MIR) of Hg. janthinomys was 34.48, second only to Hg. leucocelaenus at 34.92 [5]. Therefore, these two mosquito species were identified as the most important sylvatic vectors. The recent YFV outbreaks occurred in areas identified by our model as moderate-to-high suitability for Hg. janthinomys presence, especially along the coastal areas in the Brazilian states of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Espirito Santo, and in the eastern portion of Mato Grosso. Haemagogus janthinomys was also implicated as the primary vector during YFV outbreaks in the Atlantic Forest region in the state of Rio de Janeiro during the 1930s-1940s [68]. Therefore, areas predicted as highly suitable for Hg. janthinomys occurrence may serve as locations of potential disease spillover that could be targeted for increased surveillance and enhanced vector control and disease mitigation efforts.
Prior research has suggested that environmental factors such as temperature and precipitation contribute to Hg. janthinomys abundance [19]. Several studies have reported that Hg. janthinomys abundance was substantially higher in the wet season than in the dry season [6971] and relative humidity was significantly correlated with Hg. janthinomys abundance [55]. Several variables related to precipitation (the precipitation of the driest month, the precipitation seasonality, and the precipitation of the coldest quarter) were included in our model, although none contributed a substantial amount of information. The greatest suitability for Hg. janthinomys presence occurred between 0% and 15% precipitation seasonality, suggesting that the mosquito is found in areas of lower variability in rainfall.
The analysis of variable contributions demonstrated that BIO2 (mean diurnal range) had the greatest relative contribution to our model and the greatest training and test gain based on the jackknife test. According to the response curve for BIO2, the ideal diurnal range for mosquito suitability peaks at 6°C followed by a steep decline. Furthermore, the most important variable in our model according to permutation importance was BIO1 (annual average temperature), with peak suitability occurring around 25°C. Several studies have explored the impact of temperature fluctuations on Aedes and Anopheles mosquito dynamics [7274], demonstrating that large diurnal temperature range can affect life history traits including larval development time, adult survival, and reproductive output. Our findings also suggest that average temperature and daily temperature fluctuations may impact habitat suitability for Hg. janthinomys. Peak activity of Hg janthinomys has been found to occur during periods of high temperature [69]. In addition, temperature was found to be significantly correlated with Hg. janthinomys abundance at various canopy heights [55]. However, further research is necessary to better understand the impact of temperature fluctuations on Hg. janthinomys activity and its ability to transmit pathogens.
The categorical land cover variable also had a large relative contribution to our models. The most common land cover type at the Hg. janthinomys occurrence points was evergreen broadleaf forest. Haemagogus janthinomys is an arboreal species that has recently been detected in many different forest types including mangrove, semi-evergreen seasonal, evergreen seasonal, and young secondary forest [58]. Researchers have captured Hg. janthinomys mosquitoes in the canopy of the Brazilian rainforest, as high as 16m above the ground [5557]. The presence of forest cover is therefore an important predictor of the Hg. janthinomys distribution due to the mosquitos acrodendrophilic nature. Despite its preference for forest canopies, blood meal analysis has demonstrated that Hg. janthinomys feeding patterns are diverse, and female mosquitoes may move between the canopy and ground level to collect a blood meal [75]. Although Hg. janthinomys mosquitoes bite predominantly in the tree canopy, they have demonstrated substantial dispersion, being detected frequently at ground level and in open fields [5,56].
The response of the land cover variable to Hg. janthinomys suitability identified the urban/built-up land cover class as an important predictor of Hg. janthinomys presence. Although Hg. janthinomys mosquitoes are primarily an arboreal mosquito, they have been detected in forest fragments adjacent to major urban areas. For example, Hendy et al., reported the presence of Hg. janthinomys at an urban park in Manaus, Brazil, within 100m of the forest edge [76] and at another urban park bordering the northern edge of the city [56,76]. Similarly, de Abreu et al., detected Hg. janthinomys in small forest fragments close to urban areas and in urbanized settlements in recently cut forests [5]. An additional study found Hg. janthinomys close to agricultural communities in Trinidad [58]. It is evident that forest fragmentation may play an important role in Hg. janthinomys presence and encourage feeding in peri-domestic or peri-urban environments [77]. Furthermore, Hg. janthinomys mosquitoes have demonstrated the ability to travel up to 11.5km [78,79]. These findings underscore the importance of Hg. janthinomys as a potential bridge vector between sylvatic and urban transmission cycles.
Changing patterns of land use/land cover and encroachment into forested areas may increase human exposure to Hg. janthinomys and to the pathogens they transmit. Several studies have suggested an occupational risk to MAYV infection among rainforest hunters [80] and forest crop-plot workers [81]. In addition, high MAYV seroprevalence has been found in populations residing close to forested areas [82,83]. Communities in close proximity to the forest should therefore be prioritized for vector and pathogen surveillance to determine if MAYV or YFV are circulating in local mosquito populations.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the findings. One major limitation is the sampling bias associated with mosquito collections. Areas of high accessibility, including those in close proximity to roads, are more likely to be sampled, potentially leading to inaccurate models [35]. As a result, the presence records that we have compiled do not represent the complete ecological niche of Hg. janthinomys but may be biased toward accessible locations. We attempted to correct for sampling bias by including a bias layer during the model-building process, according to techniques proposed by Phillips et al. [33], to ensure selection of background points with the same bias as the presence records. However, it is likely that our results are still impacted by the sampling bias inherent in our data set.
Another limitation inherent in the ecological niche modeling process is the use of a limited set of environmental covariates. While the covariate significance assessment identified insignificant covariates (subsequently removed from the statistically robust ENM) from the complete pool of 32 topographic and bioclimatic covariates, there may be additional covariates not included in this pool that are potentially significant and hence could be incorporated into the ENM. Although these variables play an important role in predicting areas of high suitability for Hg. janthinomys, other factors such as human population density, socio-economic status, host migration patterns, presence of other mosquito species (in competitive and symbiotic associations for available ecological niches), and intensity of mosquito control and disease mitigation programs can also impact the occurrence probability, habitat suitability, and geographical distributions of Hg. janthinomys.
An additional limitation is the inability to accurately assess impacts of environmental and topographic variability on Hg. janthinomys habitat suitability in countries with few Hg. janthinomys collection points (e.g., Peru). Among the 11 South American countries from which Hg. janthinomys surveillance data were collected, six countries had two or fewer collection records (collectively 5.6% of the total points used in model), whereas over two-thirds (65%) of the surveillance data used in the model were collected from one country (Brazil), reflecting a highly uneven country-level distribution of surveillance data (Table 1). When data is limited in a geographic area, outliers may carry more weight in the modeling process [48]. Furthermore, model performance may be subject to regional differences, whereby algorithm performance is superior in one region compared to another [48]. This highlights the need for further mosquito sampling across a wider geographic space in order to better characterize the conditions where Hg. janthinomys occurs.
Another potential limitation is related to the marginal response curve for the land cover variable which demonstrated very high vector habitat suitability in the urban/built-up land cover class. This may be attributed to the relatively narrow range of low urban land cover values at the sample data points. Some inaccuracies may be expected in these predictions, since the model is forced to extrapolate habitat suitability predictions beyond the range of urban land cover values for which the model was calibrated. Sample size was simply insufficient in the range of higher urban land cover for the model to be statistically robust to make realistic predictions of habitat suitability at higher land cover values. In actuality, higher urban land cover may signify lower habitat suitability, particularly since Hg. janthinomys is known to prefer forested landscapes [58]. Therefore, the species response profile may actually decrease at higher urban land cover values.
Recommendations for future research may include investigating additional mosquito species, identifying under sampled regions via surveillance gap analysis, conducting follow-up surveillance studies in these under sampled regions to reduce sampling bias, incorporating morphological and molecular data on the MAYV and YFV disease pathogens, and running updated models with the enhanced record collection dataset in efforts to further improve the efficacy and statistical robustness of the ecological niche models.

Introduction
Mosquitoes belonging to the family Culicidae are widely distributed across the globe. Much of this success is related to its ability to colonize the most different types of habitats. In their immature stage, they colonize natural and/or artificial aquatic environments of different types and sizes. For example, the Amazonian sylvatic mosquitoes of the Anophelini tribe are usually found in lakes, rivers, and fish ponds, while those of the Sabethini tribe develop in phytotelms [1, 2]. Other Amazonian species, such as those belonging to the Culicini and Aedini tribes, are eclectic regarding breeding grounds and can be found in ponds, artificial containers that accumulate water, holes in trees, and others [3]. Regarding their importance in the aquatic food chain, mosquito larvae are food for dragonflies, fish, and beetle species [4].
Mosquitoes are notably one of the main focuses of studies about emerging and re-emerging diseases worldwide. A significant fraction of the 3,614 existing mosquito species [5] are vectors of various arboviruses and other parasites that cause millions of infections and deaths in humans, mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. For example, in Brazil, severe outbreaks of arboviruses, such as Dengue (1,172,882 probable cases and 585 deaths), Zika (5,699 probable cases), Chikungunya (122,075 probable cases and 23 deaths), Yellow Fever (1,267 suspected epizootics and four deaths), have been recorded in recent years; however, the impact of co-circulating arboviruses is still unknown [6, 7]. Multifactorial causes are responsible for these outbreaks; among such factors is the change in the composition of the vector fauna caused by anthropic actions.
Several vectors of human diseases, particularly the Culicidae, are sensitive to anthropic environmental changes. When the environment is impacted, the mosquitoes suffer changes in their abundance and diversity, and in many cases, the type of landscape is directly related to their distribution and the occurrence of their hosts [8]. In addition, anthropogenic activities often result in modified habitats exhibiting various environment filter differences. Deforested habitats, for instance, are characterized by higher temperatures and greater light intensity, which can limit the occurrence of more sensitive species [9]. Nevertheless, these same conditions can reduce the larval development time for certain mosquito species [10]. Furthermore, due to the environmental alterations caused by anthropogenic activities, there is often irregular and intense rainfall, which, combined with the increased availability of human-made structures that collect water (such as fish farming tanks, water storage tanks, and improperly disposed of trash), can provide a more diverse range of oviposition sites.
Habitat modification can generate different scenarios of mosquito Beta-diversity within a landscape. Several non-random local extinctions of habitat-specialist, or more sensible species, can show us a pattern where the community of the ""new"" habitats is a subset of the original habitat (nested pattern) [11]. The community of the modified habitat can receive new species by migrating from other habitats, generating a nested pattern [12]. Both mechanisms of pattern generation through nestedness do not necessarily exclude one another, and immigrant species can potentially replace locally extinct species or even cause their extinction, leading to a community with high species turnover [11, 13]. Chaves et al. [14] verified the association between the percentage of vegetation cover and the diversity of Amazonian mosquitoes and found that, in general, the decrease in vegetation cover led to the loss of Culicidae diversity, however, Anopheles darlingi, the primary vector of malaria in the region, has become dominant in the most anthropized areas.
Both nested and turnover patterns of Beta diversity are not excluded within a landscape. Some studies have identified the ecotone between forested and anthropic areas to host more species of Culicidae because they harbor both: species typical of forests and habitat-generalist commonly found in anthropized areas [15, 16]. So, anthropization can generate a complex landscape, increasing the Beta-diversity among different landscape unities. This higher diversity can influence the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases since sylvatic mosquito vectors are frequently found in these places [17]. Vieira et al. [18] identified sylvatic vectors Cx. declarator and Cx. (Melanoconion) spp. in urbanized areas of a region in the Southern Amazon. In addition to this evidence of apparent modification of the fauna in response to anthropization, there is also concern regarding the spillover phenomenon, where pathogens such as arboviruses, which were previously restricted to the sylvatic cycle, start circulating in previously uninfected human population, through bridge vectors [1921]. Identifying such a phenomenon is a crucial factor in predicting future outbreaks.
On a more local scale, people living in rural Amazonian settlements are constantly affected by mosquito-borne diseases, which might be an effect of landscape modification due to sustenance practices, such as deforestation for subsistence agriculture or extensive livestock farming, fish farming ponds, hunting, and others [22, 23]. As the type of landscape can influence the mosquito community, our study primarily aimed to compare the abundance, richness, and patterns of the composition of mosquitoes among the forest, forest edge, and peridomicile habitat in small farms of Brazilian Central Amazon, and also identify the species composition of each habitat.
We hypothesize that different mosquito species will react differently to their habitat changes. More generalist mosquito species, which can use various breeding sites, possess a varied diet, and withstand sudden abiotic changes, will likely colonize diverse environments. Conversely, species with more restricted breeding habits will show a restricted distribution within our sample sites, limited to specific environments, such as more forested or anthropized areas. Based on this, we predict that: 1) the richness and the abundance of species will be higher on the edge of the forest; 2) the three habitats will show a different mosquito composition. When considering the causes for the potential differences in mosquito species composition, we infer that: 2.1) most of the variation will be due to the replacement of species between habitats (turnover), and; 2.2) this will result in different indicator species to each habitat type. The variation in mosquito species composition between environments due to nesting will only account for a small portion of the mosquito population.
Methods
Study area
Mosquitoes for this study were collected in a rural settlement of Rio Pardo (S01º4902.4"" W060º1903.6""), municipality of Presidente Figueiredo, in the state of Amazonas, Brazil. The settlement is located in a dense ombrophilous terra firme forest bordering the Canoas Settlement, WaimiriAtroari Indigenous Reserve, and private or Brazilian government lands. Rio Pardo was officially created in 1996 through the National Institute for Colonization of Agrarian Reform and comprised an area of about 28,000 hectares, approximately 550 inhabitants, and around 170 households. The settlement consists of 6 unpaved roads, wooden houses, monoculture plantations, and fish ponds. According to the Köppen-Geiger classification, the climate in the area is moist tropical [24], with an average annual temperature of 27°C and two climatic seasons: rainy (November to May) and dry (June to October) (Fig 1).

From a satellite image of IKONOS, 18 sampling points were randomly selected. Each point was delimited by a 200-meter buffer and covered three different environments: forest (area with vast preserved and non-flooded vegetation""terra firme"" rain forest); forest edge (intermediate region, between the anthropized site and the natural vegetation fragment); and peridomicile (surrounding the residence, having an orchard, vegetable garden and livestock like chickens, pigs, dogs, and others).
Mosquito collection
Eight collections were interspersed between 2020 and 2021 (S1 Table). To capture a greater diversity of immatures, we used three types of larvitraps (bamboo internodes, plastic containers, and tires) (S1 Fig). The bamboo internode container was made by cutting the top opening of each internode, thus, facilitating the removal of the collected material. The tires were received as donations from tire stores and cut in halves. After the confection, all larvitraps were sanitized to avoid contamination. In each type of environment, one unit of each kind of larvitraps was installed so that in the end, each sampling point had nine larvitraps (1 x 3 x 3) and a total of 162 larvitraps (18 x 3 x 3) per collection event. The larvitraps were installed 1 m above the ground and filled with about 500 ml of untreated well water. Fifteen days after installation, all water and the organic material were removed from each larvitraps, inserted in individual plastic bags, duly labeled, and the larvitraps were refilled with water. In the laboratory, the collected material was sorted to separate possible predators, and the mosquito larvae were reared in plastic pots containing water and organic material obtained from the larvitraps at the time of collection. The emerged adults were stored in a -20 refrigerator for later identification with dichotomous keys [25, 26]. The nomenclature used in this study was according to [27].

We declare that all participants were instructed, agreed to participate in the study, and signed a written consent form. This work did not include minors.
Data analysis
To evaluate the effects of environments on mosquito abundance of individuals and the number of species, we used Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) with Gaussian distribution (for normally distributed abundance values) and Poison distribution (indicated to count data). The type of trap installed at the sites (1|trap/site) was used as a random factor in the model. The lme4 and lmerTest packages were used to perform the GLMMs and evaluated the adequacy and overdispersion using the DHARMa package [2830]. The rarefaction curve, based on individuals, was constructed to determine whether the number of mosquitoes collected in the environments reached the species richness saturation point. To evaluate the influence of environments on mosquito composition, we applied a Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) with the vegan package [31]. After detecting significant differences (p&lt;0.05), we performed a paired PERMANOVA (pairwiseAdonis package) [32] to identify the environment(s) where this difference was observed. We have also used a Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) to spatially represent the species diversity profiles of each environment with the ggplot2 and vegan packages functions, adonis and metaMDS [31, 33].
To determine whether the dissimilarity in species composition could be explained by species substitution or nestedness, we applied the additive partitioning of beta diversity using the betapart 1.5.6 package [34]. We used the qualitative data matrix to calculate the beta diversity using the Sørensen dissimilarity index (SOR), partitioned into beta Simpson (SIM), which indicated species substitution, and beta nestedness (NES), which quantified subsets of communities. To verify the possible fidelity and specificity of species to specific environments, the species indication value (IndVal) was obtained with the labdsv package [35]. Except for the rarefaction curve, which was performed using the Past 4.09 program [36], all other statistical analyses were performed using the R software [37].
Results
A total of 15,547 individuals were collected, which were distributed among 26 species of immature mosquitoes. Among the environments, the forest had a greater abundance of mosquitoes, with 5,555 individuals, followed by forest edge, with 5,428 individuals, and peridomicile, with 4,564 individuals. Forest edge showed a higher species richness with 26 species, while in forest and peridomicile, the richness of immature mosquitoes was in both, represented by 20 species (Table 1).
In all environments, the most abundant species was Culex urichii, representing 65.92% of the total specimens collected in the forest, 57.06% in the forest edge, and 35.43% in the peridomicile. The second and third most abundant species in forest and forest edge were, respectively, Cx. (Melanoconion) sp. (20.95% in forest, 17.08% in forest edge) and Orthopodomyia fascipes (4.05% in forest, 8.79% in forest edge). In addition to Cx. urichii, the other most abundant species in the peridomicile, were Aedes albopictus (26.31%) and Trichoprosopon digitatum (9.22%).
The abundance (x2 = 5.6088, df = 2, p = 0.06) and richness (x2 = 9.1881, df = 2, p = 0.01) of mosquitoes were influenced by the difference among studied environments. Forest edge and forest showed similar abundance averages (± 110 individuals), while peridomicile averaged ± 80. As for richness, peridomicile and forest edge were closer in their averages (± 5.8 species), whereas forest showed the lowest average (± 4.8 species) (Fig 2).

It was possible to obtain the asymptote in the rarefaction curve of the species in all environments. For the forest edge, species diversity started being different from 1,500 specimens upwards compared to the other environments. Forest and peridomicile showed relative approximations in their means and standard deviation of species diversity (Fig 3).

The species occurrence between the three environments differed significantly (PERMANOVA r2 = 0.12868, F 11.668, p = 2e-04). The paired PERMANOVA test showed that all environments were statistically distinct from each other: Forest edge x Forest (r2 = 0.02684, F 2.8964, p = 0.025); Forest edge x Peridomicile (r2 = 0.08008, F 9.1401, p = 0.001); Forest x Peridomicile (r2 = 0.17611, F 22.6527, p = 0.001). The spatial distribution of species frequency among the three environments showed more significant dissimilarity between the peridomicile and forest. In contrast, the forest edge was more similar to the forest (Fig 4). In general, when evaluating the composition from the occurrence of species, the additive partition of SOR (SOR, mean = 0,5400838) showed that 73% of the dissimilarity was due to species substitution among sampling points (turnover, mean = 0,3974169) and just 27% was due to difference in richness among sampling points (nesting, mean = 0,142667).
Eleven species were identified as potential bioindicators. Orthopodomyia fascipes and Wyeomyia aponoroma showed greater specificity and fidelity to the forest edge environment. Culex (Mel.) sp. and Cx. urichii were the bioindicators of forest habitats. Aedes albopictus, Toxorhynchites haemorrhoidalis, Sabethes bipartipes, Limatus durhamii, Haemagogus janthinomys, Sa. tridentatus and Sa. glaucodaemon were associated with the peridomicile environment (Table 2).
Discussion
Our study in an area of recent settlement in Central Amazonia suggested that habitat anthropization may cause variation in the abundance, richness, and composition of mosquito species. These results have several significant consequences from ecological and public health points of view. We observed that the substitution of mosquito fauna (turnover) is the main component of the beta diversity associated with the landscape changes. So, the effect of anthropic modification on landscape generates ""new"" habitats, permitting the establishment or favoring the survival of those species which were not common to the forest. This causes a scenario where a given person on the deforestation frontier faces three different mosquito fauna associated with each habitat, separated only by a few meters: the peridomicile, the forest edge, and the forest. Thus, this person is consequently subjected to a greater variety of diseases transmitted by mosquito vectors.
The species collected in this study are relatively common throughout the Amazon region and, for example, represent 45% of the total species richness recorded in Rio Pardo [15]. As these are micro-breeding sites, it was predictable that most of the mosquitoes collected were associated with phytotelma, which reduced the richness of mosquitoes in this study. However, our rarefaction curve proved that it was possible to collect at least the most common species from the analyzed sites based on our capture method. Other studies conducted in the Brazilian Amazon have shown difficulties in sampling until mosquito richness is saturated, especially when dealing with forest environments [38, 39]. The use of multiple collection methods can maximize the capture of different Culicidae species. One of the latest inventories to record a high richness of Amazonian species was carried out by Hutchings et al. [40], where, through capturing adult and immature mosquitoes with different types of traps, the authors successfully identified 112 species of mosquitoes.
Being the most abundant species in the study, Cx. urichii represented more than half of the collected mosquitoes and was also present in all environments. In our previous study [41], Cx. urichii was also classified as the most abundant species, but in other surveys of regional fauna, this species was observed in low abundance [42, 43]. This species is generally present in primary and secondary forest environments and, so far, has not been associated with arboviruses [44, 45]. Culex (Mel.) and Or. fascipes were observed to be in greater abundance in the forest habitat. It was not possible to identify the mosquitoes of the subgenus Melanoconion at the species level, as it is a species complex, but in general, these culicids are present in various environments, ranging from preserved to highly anthropized sites [46, 47]. Some species of Cx. (Mel.) participate in the natural cycle of arboviruses, including Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis and West Nile virus. However, Or. fascipes is a primarily sylvatic mosquito with no medical importance [48]. In the peridomicile habitat, the most abundant mosquitoes were found to be Ae. albopictus and Tr. digitatum. Both Ae. albopictus and Tr. digitatum are associated with anthropic environments and are vectors of several arboviruses [49, 50]. Therefore, the abundance of such species in the peridomicile environment represents a high risk of arbovirus outbreak for people living in this settlement.
This study observed the effect of the environment on mosquito abundance and species richness. The averages and absolute values of abundance and species richness in the environments indicated that the most preserved and transitional locations had higher abundances, whereas the richness was higher in transitional and anthropized areas (Fig 2). Forest edge, classified as a transition environment, was associated with higher abundance and species richness. The change in the mosquito richness and abundance pattern is generally correlated; preserved areas with greater richness and anthropized areas with greater abundance have been reported in some studies (e.g., [16, 51, 52]). In the Southern Brazilian Amazon, Vieira et al. [53] reported differences in mosquito abundance and richness between different sites and observed that abundance and richness were positively correlated with disturbed landscapes. Due to the particularity of each study, such as sampled locations, collection method, and others, it isnt easy to measure what may be leading to this difference in abundance and richness between preserved and anthropic environments.
It was possible to identify a difference in the composition of the mosquito community, as predicted in our hypothesis. The group of species that composed each environment was somewhat expected, for example, Ae. albopictus and Li. durhamii were correlated to the peridomicile; these species are usually known to have preferences for the most anthropic sites [50, 54]. However, mosquitoes, like Hg. janthinomys and some species of the genus Sabethes, usually known as sylvatic, were observed to be associated with the anthropic environment. Other studies have also reported the presence Hg. janthinomys in forest edges, open fields, and urban/built-up land cover [55, 56]. We believe that the alteration of its natural habitat due to deforestation, associated with food eclecticism [57], and its ability to fly great distances [58] may cause the successful colonization of Hg. janthinomys in new environments. As for Sabethes species, despite being associated with anthropized environments in this study, such results need to be further investigated since the general abundance of these species was low. However, Hendy et al. [59] propose that due to the ability of Sabethes species to reproduce in a wide variety of phytotelms, they can establish themselves on the forest edges.
Orthopodomyia fascipes and Wy. aponorama, which are usually frequent in preserved environments with their immatures developing into phytotelmata [25, 60], were associated with the forest edge environment in this work. Although we have not evaluated other factors related to the presence of these species, we suggest that the microbreeding sites found at the forest edge, as well as the greater intensity of light and higher temperature, when compared to the interior of the forest, could be promoting the establishment of Or. fascipes and Wy. aponorama in these environments. The difference in the composition of the culicids community in our investigation area was primarily associated with the change of species among the sampling points concerning the environments analyzed (see Results). The turnover in the mosquito community due to landscape gradients is routinely observed in other studies [13, 6163] and is generally influenced by the characteristics of the local habitat. In this case, associated anthropogenic species are favored and replace the peridomiciles typical local fauna. Also, the occurrence of some species is favored in the forest edge. The mechanisms of such replacement are still unknown, but we suggest they are associated with factors such as ecological filtering, competition, predation, and others [9, 64]. So, based on our results, we can say that there are three locally adapted non-independent communities, one for each studied habitat. The occurrence and abundance of typically sylvatic vector species in anthropic environments, such as those identified here (Table 1), maybe a worrying factor and possibly lead to an increase in human-vector contact [65, 66]. The presence of anthropic vectors, e.g., Ae. albopictus, in forest edges and forests, also impose a risk of infection of viruses in each habitat (Table 1).
From an epidemiological point of view, the specificity of sylvatic vectors in the peridomiciliary environment represents an additional aggravating factor for rural inhabitants, who generally live in conditions of social vulnerability in the settlement. As favorable conditions were created for establishing sylvatic species in anthropic environments, especially vectors, local arboviral outbreaks could possibly emerge and re-emerge. The high seroprevalence of the Mayaro virus in children and women from Rio Pardo, who usually did not frequent the forest, raised the hypothesis that this arbovirus was possibly being transmitted by other vectors [67]. However, based on our results (see also [41]), we cannot rule out the possibility that the primary vector, Hg. janthinomys is involved in the transmission cycle of this virus in this settlement.
Our study corroborated our hypotheses and provided evidence that anthropogenic changes influence the Amazonian mosquito community. We showed that species richness and abundance of mosquitoes were correlated with habitat type. The difference in the composition of the mosquito fauna is primarily related to the substitution of the dominant species among different environments (turnover). The presence and higher abundance of notorious vector species, such as Ae. albopictus and the other indicators species, in the peridomicile environment, associated with favorable conditions for their establishment and survival (e.g., access to food resources and a variety of breeding sites), increases the risk of circulating arboviruses. Such observations reinforce the need for further exploratory field studies regarding the landscape features and their modifications that may shape the mosquito community, as environmental changes arising from anthropic factors significantly impact the diversity of mosquitoes.

At the Annual Shareholders' Meeting
1. To resolve on the financial statements and management accounts for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.
The Company's financial statements for the fiscal year ended on December 31, 2023, as disclosed on the CVM and B3 websites, through the IPE Module of the Empresas.NET System, and published on the website and in the newspaper Valor Econômico (""Financial Statements
""), were reviewed by the Company's Board of Directors at a meeting held on March 26, 2024, and forwarded for disclosure and resolution at the Annual Shareholders Meeting, pursuant to article 19, item VI, of the Company's Bylaws.
JBS's Fiscal Council reviewed the Financial Statements and issued an opinion on March 26, 2024, indicating that the Financial Statements are in a condition to be disclosed by the Company. Additionally, the Company's Statutory Audit Committee, in a meeting held on March 25, 2024, issued its report recommending that the Financial Statements be forwarded to the Company's Board of Directors for evaluation.
Management's comments on the Company's financial situation are attached as Appendix

Therefore, it proposes the approval of the annual and overall compensation for management and individual members of the Fiscal Council and the Statutory Audit Committee for the fiscal year of 2024, in the amount of up to R$269,342,164.59 (two hundred and sixty-nine million, three hundred and forty-two thousand, one hundred and sixty-four reais and fifty-nine cents).
With regard to the overall compensation of the members of the Company's Fiscal Council, management emphasizes that such amount will be, for each sitting member, equal to 0.1 (one tenth) of the compensation that, on average, is attributed to each executive officer, not including profit sharing, until the Company's next annual shareholder meeting, noting that such amount may only be altered according to article 162, paragraph 3, of the Brazilian Corporation Law. Additionally, alternate members will only receive remuneration in the absence of the respective sitting member.
The information relating to section 8 of the Reference Form can be found in Appendix III
 of this Proposal, in compliance with article 13 of CVM Resolution 81.
The amount proposed for the overall compensation for management relating to the fiscal year of 2024 is compatible with the amounts usually paid by the market and with the criteria and conditions adopted by the Company to comprise the compensation for the members of its management.
Management informs that the overall limit approved by the ASM 2023, relating to the compensation for the fiscal year of 2023, in the total amount of R$126,180,813.41 (one hundred and twenty-six million, one hundred and eighty thousand, eight hundred and thirteen reais and forty-one cents) was effectively paid.
For reference, the table below indicates the amounts actually paid as compensation for the members of the Company's management and Fiscal Council in the last three fiscal years:

In compliance with the provisions of article 150 of the Brazilian Corporation Law and article 16, paragraph 9, of the Company's Bylaws, given the resignations submitted by Mrs. Leila Abraham Loria, Mrs. Claudia Pimentel Trindade Prates, and Mr. Estêvão de Almeida Accioly, the Company's Board of Directors appointed, on July 20, 2023, Mrs. Kátia Regina de Abreu Gomes, Mr. Paulo Bernardo Silva and Mr. Cledorvino Belini to replace them.
Under the legal and statutory provisions referred to above, in the event of a vacant position for a member of the Board of Directors, or his/her alternate, the replacement may be appointed by the remaining directors and shall be valid until the Company's subsequent Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Therefore, the Company's management proposes to ratify the election of the following members to its Board of Directors:
<table><tr><td>(i)</td><td>

 </td></tr></table>
The ratification of the election of the aforementioned members was examined by the Company's Governance Committee, which issued a recommendation to the Board of Directors in favor of this ratification. The Company's Board of Directors expressed that the nomination of each candidate as member of the Board of Directors adheres to the Nomination and Training Policy for Members of the Board of Directors, Executive Board, and Committees.
Management clarifies that, pursuant to article 11 of CVM Resolution 81, the information regarding the professional experience and independence of the candidates for the positions of members of the Board of Directors indicated above are detailed in Appendix II
 of this Proposal.
5
2. To resolve on the eligibility of the three members of the Board of Directors as independent Board members.
The adherence of the nominated members, namely Kátia Regina de Abreu Gomes, Paulo Bernardo Silva and Cledorvino Belini with the independence criteria established in the Novo Mercado Regulation, in CVM Resolution 80/2022, and the Company's Bylaws was analyzed by the Company's Board of Directors and the members of its Governance, Compensation and Nomination Committee, who are in favor of their characterization as independent members.
The Company also received statements from the newly elected Board Members stating that they (a) are not direct or indirect controlling shareholders of the Company; (b) do not have voting rights in Board of Directors' meetings bound by shareholders' agreements related to the Company; (c) are not spouses, partners, or relatives, up to the second degree of the controlling shareholder, Company managers, or managers of the controlling shareholder; and (d) have not been employed or served as executive officers of the Company or its controlling shareholder in the last 3 (three) years.
3. To resolve on the increase in the number of members to comprise the Company's Board of Directors for the current term of office until the annual shareholders' meeting to be held in 2025, from 9 (nine) to 11 (eleven) members.
Pursuant to article 16 of JBS's Bylaws, the Board of Directors may be comprised of a minimum of 5 (five) and a maximum of 11 (eleven) members, with a unified term of office of 2 (two) years.
The Company's Annual General Meeting held on April 24, 2023, established the number of members to comprise the Board of Directors as 9 (nine), with a term of office the Annual Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2025.
The Company's management proposes, in this AESM, the approval for 2 (two) new seats, increasing the number of sitting members from 9 (nine) to 11 (eleven), with a unified term of office of 2 (two) years, until the Annual Shareholders' Meeting that analyzes, discusses, and votes on management accounts and the financial statements for the fiscal year ended on December 31, 2024.
6
4. To resolve on the election of 2 (two) new sitting members for the Company's Board of Directors.
If item (3) of the agenda of the AESM is approved, the management of JBS proposes to elect the following candidates to fill the two new approved seats for the Company's Board of Directors:
<table><tr><td>Name</td></tr><tr><td>
 Wesley Mendonça Batista</td></tr><tr><td>
 Joesley Mendonça Batista</td></tr></table>
 The Company's Board of Directors expressed that the nomination of each candidate as member of the Board of Directors adheres to the Nomination and Training Policy for Members of the Board of Directors, Executive Board, and Committees.
Management clarifies that, pursuant to article 11 of CVM Resolution 81, the information regarding the professional experience of the candidates for the positions of members of the Board of Directors indicated above are detailed in Appendix II
 of this Proposal.
Lastly, considering this is not a general election for the Board of Directors, as understood by the CVM Board (Process CVM RJ 2016/4098 and Process CVM SEI 19957.009411/2017-46, app. on 04/02/2019), the procedures for the multiple voting and separate election will not apply to the elections of the members of the Board of Directors to be carried out at this meeting.
5. To resolve on the rectification, in the protocol and justification for the incorporation, by the Company, of Midtown Participações Ltda. (""Merger
"") on information related to the real estate properties transferred to the Company within the scope of the Merger, and ratify all other provisions set forth in said instrument.
With the purpose of including new properties to be transferred to JBS arising from the incorporation of Midtown Participações Ltda. (""Midtown
"") by JBS, approved by the Company's Annual and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting held on April 30, 2018, registered at JUCESP under file number 304.772/18-5 on July 29, 2018, management proposes the approval of the adjustments in Appendix III
 of the Protocol and Justification for the Incorporation of Midtown by JBS, signed on April 30, 2018, by the management of both companies (""Protocol
""), and the information about the properties transferred to JBS within the scope of the Merger are provided in Appendix IV
 of this Proposal. The property registrations to be included are as follows:
<table><tr><td></td><td>
REGISTRATION No. 24,344 - PONTES E LACERDA/MT
 </td></tr></table><table><tr><td></td><td>
REGISTRATION No. 18,186 - PONTES E LACERDA/MT

 </td></tr></table>

The Company highlights that the Annual and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting, held on April 22, 2022, approved the inclusion of Appendix III to the Protocol, which included the description of certain properties to be transferred within the scope of the Merger, in compliance with requirements formulated by Notaries of Property Registration.
Furthermore, management proposes to ratify all other terms and conditions of the Merger established in the Protocol, with no changes being proposed in the structure of the Merger or in the rights and obligations attributed to the parties as a result of the Merger.
Management emphasizes that under the terms of the Protocol, Midtown was fully extinguished due to the Merger, being succeeded by the Company in all its rights and obligations, universally and for all legal purposes, without any continuity solution; and the Company's Annual and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting, held on April 30, 2018, authorized the Company's Executive Board to perform all acts required to carry out the Merger.
6. To resolve on the amendment of article 10, paragraph 1, of the Company's Bylaws to update the minimum call notice deadline for JBS' Annual Shareholders' Meeting.
The Company's management proposes to amend paragraph 1, article 10 of JBS' Bylaws, considering the modification to Law 6,404/76, promoted by Law 14,195, of 2021, to establish the deadline for calling the Annual Shareholders' Meeting under current and applicable laws and regulations. The legal and regulatory deadlines are already observed by JBS for calling its shareholders' meetings, so the proposed change will not result in financial or legal effects.
If the proposed change is approved by this AESM, the new wording for article 10, paragraph 1, of the Company's Bylaws will come into effect as indicated in Appendix VI
. The table that highlights the changes and proposed amendment to the Bylaws, as well as its justification, as required by CVM Resolution 81, is available in Appendix V
 of this Proposal.
7. To authorize the Company's Executive Board to carry out all necessary or convenient acts to effectively implement the resolutions approved.
If shareholders approve the matters on the agenda, management proposes the Company's Executive Board to be authorized to perform any and all acts necessary or convenient to implement such matters, thus enabling the resolutions approved to come into effect.
General Information:
Management informs that shareholders may participate in the AESM (i) in person (in this case, they may participate through a duly constituted proxy) or (ii) via Remote Voting Form, according to the documents made available on the websites of the CVM (www.cvm.gov.br), and B3 (www.b3.com.br), at the Company's headquarters, and on its Investor Relations website (https://ri.jbs.com.br/).
The Company suggests that, if possible, shareholders should prefer to participate in the AESM by submitting the Remote Voting Form to the service providers capable of collecting and transmitting instructions for filling out the form (custodian or bookkeeping agent), given the greater simplicity of this procedure.
JBS also informs that, exceptionally for this AESM, aiming to facilitate the participation of its shareholders, it will accept Remote Voting Forms, proxy instruments (duly accompanied by an identity document and/or relevant corporate acts that prove the grantor's powers) and other documents to be submitted via https://assembleia.ten.com.br/460498236 or by e-mail to ri@jbs.com.br, without notarization, legalization or apostille, according to the instructions available in the Call Notice.
Finally, the Company requests that the documents required for shareholders to participate in the AESM be sent preferably
 by 72 (seventy-two) hours prior to the meeting.

ANNEX I TO THE MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL FORORDINARY AND EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING OF JBS S.A.TO BE HELD ON APRIL 26, 2024
DIRECTORS´ COMMENTS
(As per item 1 of Annex I of CVM Resolution No. 81, of March 29, 2022)
2. Directors' Comments
2.1. Directors' comments on:
a) General financial and equity conditions
The Company's Executive Board believes that, through its product diversification strategy, its growth potential and its global production and distribution platform, combined with its positioning as a leader in the global animal protein market, JBS has sufficient financial and equity conditions to continue its business plan and meet its short and long-term obligations, including loans, financials as well as to finance its activities and cover its funding needs for at least the next 12 months.
As of December 31, 2023, the indebtedness ratio was 3.39x (represented by current liabilities plus non-current liabilities and divided by shareholders' equity), increasing compared to the 3.18x ratio of December 31, 2022. The increase presented in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 is primarily due to the distribution of R$2.2 billion in dividends.

The ratio of net debt (represented by current loans and financing plus non- current loans and financing and decreased by cash and cash equivalents) and shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2023 was 157.6%, in line when compared to the previous year, which also was 157.6%.
In the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company presented a balanced capital structure between equity and third parties in the proportion presented in the item (c) below.

 Annex I-1
The Company's need for resources primarily refers to: (i) purchase of raw material, and the acquisition of animals and grains for feeding animals for processing represents an important portion of this account; (ii) tax, labor and social obligations; (iii) payment of interest and principal on loans and financing; (iv) payment of taxes; and (v) capital expenditures related to the acquisition and maintenance of fixed assets.
The Company's main sources of funds are: (i) cash generated by operating activities and (ii) loans and financing.
The Directors believe that the cash available, the cash generation from their operating activities and the refinancing of the Company's existing loans and financing will be sufficient to cover their liquidity needs and financial commitments for the next 12 months.
Adjusted EBITDA in the period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 was R$17,146.1 million and net financial expenses in the same period were R$6,748.0 million. Thus, Adjusted EBITDA presented a coverage index of 2.5 times net financial expenses. The net debt balance, composed of loans and financing deducted from cash and cash equivalents on December 31, 2023 was R$74,058.1 million, corresponding to 4.32 times the Adjusted EBITDA.
Adjusted EBITDA in the period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 was R$34,568.4 million and net financial expenses in the same period were R$6,352.3 million. Thus, Adjusted EBITDA presented a coverage index of 5.4 times net financial expenses. The net debt balance, composed of loans and financing deducted from cash and cash equivalents on December 31, 2022 was R$79,171.9 million, corresponding to 2.29 times the Adjusted EBITDA.
d) Sources of financing for working capital and for investments in non-current assets used
The Directors believe that the cash generation from the Company's operating activities is sufficient to meet working capital obligations and investments in non-current assets. If there are any mismatches in cash and cash equivalents with the amounts due in the short term, the Company has credit facilities in the main commercial banks operating in Brazil, the United States and other countries. The Company may also use issues of debt securities in the local and international capital markets.
e) Sources of financing for working capital and for investments in non-current assets that it intends to use to cover liquidity deficiencies
The Officers believe that the cash generation from the Company's operating activities is sufficient to meet working capital obligations and investments in non-current assets. If there are any mismatches in cash and cash equivalents with the amounts due in the short term, the Company has credit facilities in the main commercial banks operating in Brazil, the United States and other countries. The Company may also use issues of debt securities in the local and international capital markets.
f) Debt levels and the characteristics of such debts, further describing:
(i) Relevant loans and financing agreements
As of December 31, 2023, loan and financing agreements totaled R$96,821.8 million, of which R$4,316.4 million represented short-term loans and R$92,505.5 million corresponded to long- term loans. On this date, loan and financing agreements represented 60.8% of current and non- current liabilities, totaling R$159,113.8 million.
As of December 31, 2022, loan and financing agreements totaled R$92,354.1 million, of which R$8,228.6 million represented short-term loans and R$84,125.5 million corresponded to long- term loans. On this date, loan and financing agreements represented 58.3% of current and non- current liabilities, totaling R$158,301.7 million.
Our financing strategy has been and will be, over the next several years, to: (1) extend the average maturity of our outstanding indebtedness, including by refinancing short-term debt through longer-term borrowings and issuing longer-term debt securities, in order to increase our liquidity levels and improve our strategic, financial and operational flexibility; and (2) reduce our financing costs by accessing lower-cost sources of finance, including through the capital markets and export finance.
Based on the profile of our indebtedness as of December 31, 2023 and our track record, we believe we will continue to be able to raise funds in U.S. dollars, euros and reais to meet our financial obligations. We further believe that our capital expenditures during recent years, in addition to capital expenditures that we intend to make in the near future, will allow us to increase our ability to generate cash, to strengthen our credit ratios and to enhance our capacity to meet our financial obligations.

Sustainability-Linked Bonds
We have issued three series of Sustainability-Linked Bonds in the international capital market, as follows:
<table><tr><td></td><td>
JBS USA 3.625% Sustainability-Linked Notes, maturing in January/2032 in the amount of US$923.0 million;
 </td></tr></table><table><tr><td></td><td>
JBS USA 3,000% Sustainability-Linked Notes, maturing in May/2032 in the amount of US$1.0 billion; and
 </td></tr></table><table><tr><td></td><td>
PPC 4.250% Sustainability-Linked Notes, maturing in April/2031 in the amount of US$1.0 billion.
 </td></tr></table>
As described below, each series of sustainability-linked notes contains certain sustainability performance targets from JBS S.A., JBS USA or PPC that, if not met, will result in an increase in the interest rate payable on the respective notes. However, the notes may not satisfy an investor's requirements or any future legal, quasi-legal or other standards for investing in assets with sustainability characteristics, and none of the issuers or their guarantors has committed to (i) allocating the net proceeds specifically to projects or business activities that meet sustainability criteria or (ii) are subject to any other limitations or requirements that may be associated with green bonds, social bonds or sustainability securities in any particular market.
The sustainability performance targets applicable to the notes are uniquely tailored to the business, operations and capabilities of JBS S.A., JBS USA and PPC, and do not easily lend themselves to comparisons with similar sustainability performance targets and the related performance of other companies. In addition, as there is currently no generally accepted definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise), nor a market consensus on what criteria a particular financial instrument should meet in order to qualify as ""green"", ""social"", ""sustainable"" or ""Sustainability- Linked"" (and, furthermore, the requirements of any label may evolve from time to time), no guarantee has been or could be given to investors by the issuers or guarantors of the notes or any second party opinion providers or any third-party assurance or attestation service provider appointed by each company (""External Verifier"") that the notes will meet all or any investor expectations with respect to the notes or the respective sustainability performance targets qualified as ""green,"" social "","" sustainable ""or"" linked to sustainability ""or that any adverse and/or other social impacts will not occur in connection with JBS, JBS S.A. and/or PPC USA or striving to achieve the respective sustainability performance targets and net resource use of the notes.
In addition, no guarantee or representation has been given by the issuers and guarantors of the notes, any third party opinion providers or any External Verifier as to the suitability or reliability for any purpose of any third party opinion, report or certification in connection with the offering of the notes or the respective sustainability performance targets to meet any green, social, sustainability, sustainability-linked and/or other criteria. Any opinion, report or certification is not - and should not be - considered.
There is no assurance as to the extent to which JBS S.A., JBS USA and/or PPC will be successful in significantly reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. While failure to achieve applicable sustainability performance targets will give rise to an upward adjustment of the interest rate relating to the notes, such failure will not be an event of default under the notes, nor will issuers and/or guarantors thereof be required to repurchase or redeem any notes in such circumstances.
Annex I-12
JBS USA 3.625% Sustainability-Linked, due in January/2032
In June 2021, JBS S.A. adopted a Structure of Bonds Linked to Sustainability establishing its strategic sustainability priorities and setting goals in relation to one of its main priority areas: Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity (as defined below). The long-term objective of JBS
S.A. is to reduce the Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity by the end of 2030, as measured against the base year 2019. As part of this goal, JBS S.A. has established a Sustainability Performance Target to reduce its Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity by 16.364% by December 31, 2025, based on linear annual improvements over the base year 2019, which will result in a 30% reduction by the end of 2030, subject to certain exclusions related to significant acquisitions and changes in laws and regulations.
JBS S.A. defines ""Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity"" as MTCO2e divided by metric tons (""MTCO2e/MT"") produced. JBS S.A. defines ""MTCO2e"" as the sum of Scope 1 emissions (primarily from burned fuels, dry ice/gaseous CO2 used as a manufacturing aid and wastewater treatment systems) and Scope 2 emissions (primarily from purchased electricity) during a given period of JBS S.A.'s global operations, measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, and ""tons produced"" as the sum of beef, chicken, fresh, frozen and value-added pork and their respective processed by-products and offals produced during a given period, measured in increments of metric tons. For the year ended December 31, 2019, JBS S.A.'s Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity was 0.2693 MTCO2e/MT produced (Scope 1 and 2), subject to third-party verification.
Pursuant to JBS USA's 3.625% Sustainability Linked Notes due January 2032, if JBS S.A. fails to meet the Sustainability Performance Target and provide confirmation to the fiduciary together with a related confirmation by an External Verifier at least 30 days prior to January 15, 2027, the interest rate payable on the notes will be increased by 25 basis points from January 15, 2027 until the due date of January 15, 2032 inclusive.
JBS USA 3,000% Sustainability-Linked Notes, due in May/2032
In November 2021, JBS USA adopted a Sustainability Linked Securities Framework setting out its strategic sustainability priorities and setting targets with respect to one of its key priority areas: Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity (as defined below). JBS USA's long-term goal is to reduce the Global Intensity of Greenhouse Gas Emissions by the end of 2030, as measured against the base year 2019. As part of this goal, JBS USA has established a Sustainability Performance Target to reduce its Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity by 20.30% by December 31, 2026, based on linear annual improvements over the base year 2019, which will result in a 30% reduction by the end of 2030, subject to certain exclusions related to significant acquisitions and changes in laws and regulations.
JBS USA defines ""Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity"" as MTCO2e divided by metric tons (""MTCO2e/MT"") produced. JBS USA defines ""MT of CO2e"" as the sum of Scope 1 emissions (primarily from burned fuels, dry ice/gaseous CO2 used as a manufacturing aid and wastewater treatment systems) and Scope 2 emissions (primarily from purchased electricity) during a given period of JBS USA's global operations, measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, and ""tons produced"" as the sum of beef, chicken, fresh, frozen and value-added pork and their respective processed by-products and offals produced during a given period, measured in increments of metric tons. For the year ended December 31, 2019, JBS USA's Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity was 0.23807 MTCO2e/MT produced (Scope 1 and 2), subject to third-party verification.
Annex I-13
Pursuant to JBS USA's 3,000% Sustainability Linked Notes due May 2032, if JBS USA fails to meet the Sustainability Performance Target and provide confirmation to the fiduciary together with a related confirmation by an External Verifier within six months after December 31, 2026, the interest rate payable on the notes will be increased by 25 basis points from November 15, 2027 through and including the due date of May 15, 2032.
PPC 4.250% Sustainability-Linked Notes, maturing in April/2031
In March 2021, PPC adopted a Structure of Bonds Linked to Sustainability establishing its strategic sustainability priorities and setting goals in relation to one of its main priority areas: Greenhouse Gas Emissions (as defined below). PPC's long-term goal is to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions intensity by the end of 2030, as measured against the base year 2019. As part of this target, PPC has established a Sustainability Performance Target to reduce its Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity by 17.679% by December 31, 2025, based on linear annual improvements over the base year 2019, which will result in a 30% reduction by the end of 2030, subject to certain exclusions related to significant acquisitions and changes in laws and regulations.
The PPC defines ""Greenhouse Gas Emission Intensity"" as tCO2e divided by 100 lbs. (""tCO2e/100 lbs."") produced. PPC defines ""tCO2e"" as the sum of Scope 1 emissions (from stationary and mobile sources) and Scope 2 emissions (from indirect emissions) during a given period of global operations, including, without limitation, the use of dry ice, measured in metrics tons of carbon dioxide equivalent and ""lbs. produced"" as the sum of fresh, frozen and value-added chicken, pork and their respective processed by-products and offals produced during a given period, measured in 100 lb. increments. For the year ended December 31, 2019, PPC's Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity was 0.00988 tCO2e/100 lbs. produced, subject to third-party verification.
Pursuant to the terms of the 4.250% Sustainability Linked Notes of PPC due April 2031, if PPC fails to meet the Sustainability Performance Target and provide confirmation to the administrator together with a related confirmation by an External Verifier at least 30 days prior to October 15, 2026, the interest rate payable on the notes will be increased by 25 basis points from October 15, 2026 through and including the due date of April 15, 2031.
Sustainability-Linked CRAs
In December 2021, JBS S.A. issued debentures underlying two series of CRAs linked to sustainability maturing in 2031 and 2036, respectively, in the aggregate principal amount of R$1.1 billion. These debentures are issued in reais and yield interest at rates of 5.8376% per annum and 6.1977% per annum, respectively.
As described below, these CRAs and the underlying debentures contain a sustainability performance target that, if not met, will result in an increase in the interest rate payable on the CRAs and the underlying debentures. However, CRAs and underlying debentures may not meet an investor's requirements or any future legal, quasi-legal or other standards for investment in assets with sustainability characteristics, and JBS S.A. has not committed to (i) allocate net proceeds specifically to projects or business activities that meet sustainability criteria or (ii) are subject to any other limitations or requirements that may be associated with green instruments, social instruments or sustainability instruments or other financial instruments in any particular market.
The sustainability performance target applicable to debentures and CRAs are uniquely tailored to the business, operations and capabilities of JBS S.A. and do not easily lend themselves to comparisons with similar sustainability performance targets and the related performance of other companies. In addition, as there is currently no generally accepted definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise), nor a market consensus on what criteria a particular financial instrument must meet to qualify as ""green"", ""social"", ""sustainable"" or ""sustainability-linked"" (and, furthermore, the requirements of any label may evolve from time to time), no guarantee has been or could be given to investors by JBS S.A., the issuer of the CRAs or any providers of second party or any third-party guarantor or attestation service provider appointed by JBS S.A. (""External Verifier"") that the debentures or CRAs will meet all or any investor expectations with respect to the debentures or CRAs or the sustainability performance target qualified as ""green"", ""social,"" ""sustainable"" or ""linked to sustainability"" or that any adverse social and/or other impacts will not occur in connection with JBS S.A. striving to achieve the sustainability performance target or the use of the net proceeds from the offering of the debentures or CRAs.
Annex I-14
In addition, no guarantee or representation has been given by JBS S.A., the issuer of the CRAs, any third party opinion providers or any External Verifier as to the suitability or reliability for any purpose of any third party opinion, report or certification in connection with the offering of the CRAs and the underlying debentures or the respective sustainability performance targets to meet any green, social, sustainability, sustainability-linked and/or other criteria. Any opinion, report or certification is not - and should not be - considered, included and/or made part of this prospectus or registration statement.
There is no guarantee as to the extent to which JBS S.A. will be successful in significantly diminishing its sustainability performance globally. Although failure to meet the sustainability performance target will give rise to an upward adjustment of the interest rate relating to the CRAs and the underlying debentures, such failure will not be an event of default under the CRAs or the underlying debentures nor will their issuers be required to repurchase or redeem the CRAs or the underlying debentures in such circumstances.
In October 2021, JBS S.A. adopted a Sustainability Linked Framework establishing its commitment to a deforestation-free supply chain in Brazil, ensuring that all suppliers comply with its zero tolerance policy for illegal deforestation and other social and environmental criteria described in its Responsible Sourcing Policy As part of this objective, JBS S.A. established a Sustainability Performance Goal to have the number of cattle related to direct suppliers registered in its Transparent Livestock Platform by the end of 2025 equal to 100% of the number of cattle slaughtered by JBS S.A. in Brazil in 2024. The Sustainability-linked framework is not included in this prospectus or the registration statement, nor is it incorporated into this prospectus or the registration statement by reference.
JBS S.A. has developed a supplier monitoring system that uses satellite images and georeferenced data from supplier farms to try to ensure that the company buys raw material only from producers who fully meet its socio-environmental criteria, including zero tolerance for illegal deforestation and encroachment on protected areas, such as indigenous lands or environmental preservation areas; having no areas embargoed by the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA); and not being on the Ministry of the Economy's Forced Labor Black List. The system also blocks the purchase of livestock from farmers involved in rural violence or land conflicts. As a result, JBS S.A. has blocked more than 11,000 cattle supply farms for non-compliance to date. In 2020, JBS S.A. made a stronger commitment to sustainability in the Amazon biome by launching its own privately funded blockchain platform, the Transparent Livestock Platform, which enables JBS to advance cattle traceability and monitor its entire livestock supply chain, including suppliers from our suppliers. Direct livestock suppliers have been asked to provide information about their suppliers through the Transparent Livestock Platform, which analyzes compliance suppliers from our suppliers' farms, which will be validated by third parties. The result of the analysis will be sent directly to the JBS supplier, who will be able to view socio-environmental compliance throughout its supply chain. It is our goal, through blockchain technology, to maintain a commitment to the security and confidentiality of third party information throughout the process. Direct suppliers are responsible for registering their own suppliers (i.e. our secondary suppliers) on the platform. The direct suppliers will collect your data through a specific application - developed by us - that will screen the necessary information from the official documents for the platform. The platform will automatically send the results of the socio-environmental analysis of secondary suppliers' ownership to direct suppliers, allowing them to manage their own supply chain, in accordance with JBS S.A's Responsible Procurement Policy.
As of January 1, 2026, it will be mandatory for all JBS S.A. direct livestock suppliers to adhere to the Transparent Livestock Platform and demonstrate that their own supply chain meets JBS S.A's Responsible Procurement Policy. Suppliers who do not cooperate and comply will be prevented from selling to JBS S.A. A transparent roadmap with intermediate targets to assess progress from now until 2025 has also been developed. This includes annual targets based on the previous year's total slaughter and expressed in number of heads of cattle for each period, to ensure incremental progress. Annual targets will be checked annually by third parties.
Under the sustainability-related CRAs, if JBS S.A. fails to meet the Sustainability Performance Target and confirms this by an External Verifier by May 31, 2026, the interest rate payable on the underlying CRAs and debentures will be increased by 25 basis points and including May 31, 2026 up to and including the respective maturity dates.

Revolving Credit Facility can be increased to US$500.0 million with an accordion expansion feature, which is subject to obtaining lender commitments. The JBS S.A. Revolving Credit Facility initially matures in August 2025 and includes two one-year extensions that can be exercised at the borrowers' option. Pursuant to the terms of the JBS S.A. Revolving Credit Facility, the interest rate under any borrowings will accrue at an adjusted secured overnight financing rate (""SOFR""), plus applicable margins that are based on the corporate rating of JBS S.A. As of December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under the JBS S.A. Revolving Credit Facility.
JBS USA Senior Unsecured Revolving Facility
On November 1, 2022, JBS USA, JBS USA Food Company, JBS USA Finance, Inc. (prior to its dissolution), JBS Australia and JBS Canada, as borrowers, entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility (the ""JBS USA Senior Unsecured Revolving Facility""), with Bank of Montreal, as administrative agent, and the lender parties thereto. The JBS USA Senior Unsecured Revolving Facility provides for a revolving credit commitment in an amount up to US$1,500.0 million with a maturity in 2027, with two one-year extension options at each lender's discretion. The facility is available in two tranches of US$900.0 million and US$600.0 million and in multiple currencies, subject to sub-limits with respect to any amounts borrowed in currencies other than amounts borrowed in Dollars. These loans bear interest at the applicable benchmark rate or the prime rate plus applicable margins that are based on the corporate credit or family rating of JBS USA.
Guarantees. Subject to the JBS USA Collateral Cure described below, borrowings are guaranteed by JBS S.A., certain other direct or indirect parent companies of JBS USA, each of the borrowers under the JBS USA Senior Unsecured Revolving Facility and any subsidiary of JBS USA that guarantees material indebtedness of any borrower or any subsidiary that is a guarantor. Following a JBS USA Collateral Cure (as described below), each wholly-owned subsidiary of each borrower is required to become a guarantor.
Covenants. The JBS USA Senior Unsecured Revolving Facility contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default. In addition, the JBS USA Senior Unsecured Revolving Facility and subject to the JBS USA Collateral Cure described below, includes a financial maintenance covenant that requires compliance with a maximum total debt to capitalization of 55.0%, which shall be tested at the end of each fiscal quarter of the borrowers (the ""JBS USA Financial Maintenance Covenant"").
Collateral Cure. After the end of any fiscal quarter, the borrowers may give notice that they will not be in compliance with the JBS USA Financial Maintenance Covenant and instead may elect to cause the borrowers, the guarantors and each subsidiary guarantor to provide security interests in the collateral that secured the prior secured revolving credit facility (the ""JBS USA Collateral Cure""). From and after the date of the JBS USA Collateral Cure, the JBS USA Financial Maintenance Covenant will no longer be in effect and availability under the JBS USA Senior Unsecured Revolving Facility will be limited and subject to collateral coverage utilizing a 75% advance rate on U.S. receivables and a 50% advance rate on U.S. inventory, subject to certain exceptions.
As of December 31, 2023, there were no outstanding borrowings under the JBS USA Senior Unsecured Revolving Facility.
Annex I-16
PPC Credit Facility
On October 4, 2023, PPC and certain of PPC's subsidiaries entered into a Revolving Syndicated Facility Agreement (the ""PPC Revolving Credit Facility"") with CoBank, ACB as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the other lenders party thereto. The PPC Revolving Credit Facility replaced the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of August 9, 2021 (as amended, modified, extended, restated, amended and restated, replaced, or supplemented prior to the date hereof, the ""PPC Existing Credit Agreement""). The PPC Revolving Credit increased PPC's availability under the revolving loan commitment from $800.0 million to $850.0 million, amended certain covenants, and extended the maturity date of PPC's revolving loan commitments from August 9, 2026 to October 4, 2028. Outstanding borrowings under the PPC Revolving Credit bear interest at a per annum rate equal to either SOFR or the prime rate plus applicable margins based on PPC's credit ratings.
Subject to the PPC Collateral Cure (as defined below), the PPC Revolving Credit Facility is not guaranteed by any of PPC's subsidiaries and is unsecured. The PPC Revolving Credit will be used for general corporate purposes and replaces the PPC Existing Credit Agreement.
The PPC Revolving Credit contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default. In addition, the PPC Revolving Credit Facility and subject to the PPC Collateral Cure, includes a financial maintenance covenant that requires PPC not to permit its interest coverage ratio to be less than 3.50:1.00, which shall be tested at the end of each fiscal quarter of PPC (the ""PPC Financial Maintenance Covenant"").
After the end of any fiscal quarter, PPC may give notice that they will not be in compliance with the PPC Financial Maintenance Covenant and instead may elect to cause the borrowers and each subsidiary guarantor to provide security interests in the collateral that secured the PPC Existing Credit Agreement (the ""PPC Collateral Cure""). From and after the date of the PPC Collateral Cure, the PPC Financial Maintenance Covenant will no longer be in effect and availability under the PPC Revolving Credit Facility will be limited and subject to certain terms and conditions.
As of December 31, 2023, PPC had outstanding letters of credit and available borrowings under the revolving credit commitment of US$25.1 million and US$824.9 million, respectively. There were no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2023.
JBS S.A. Agribusiness Receivables Certificates
From October 2019 through October 2023, JBS S.A. issued several series of non-convertible unsecured debentures through private placements in Brazil, with maturities ranging from 2023 until 2038. These debentures are denominated in Brazilian reais and bear interest at various rates, with an annual average interest rate of 5.81% as of December 31, 2023. A larger part of these debentures have their principal amount adjusted according to the Brazilian inflation - IPCA (Índice Nacional de Preços ao Consumidor Amplo). These debentures underlie the securitization of agribusiness receivables in Brazil through the issuance of agribusiness receivables certificates (Certificados de Recebíveis do Agronegócio) (""CRAs""). The net proceeds from the issuances of these debentures have been used primarily to acquire cattle, natural products and other inputs necessary for the processing or industrialization of bovine cattle, including the slaughter, preparation of by-products, and the manufacturing of meat products from the primary slaughter process mentioned above, as well as the sale of the resulting products and by-products of such process, including exportation, intermediation, storage, and transportation of the products, by- products, and derivatives. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the CRAs was US$2,201.3 million.

The nominal income tax rate in Brazil is 34%, but the Company's effective rate may vary from period to period based primarily on fluctuations in taxable income generated by each of its subsidiaries abroad, as well as differences in nominal tax rates and tax credits generated from the taxes paid in each of these subsidiaries abroad, which can be used to offset income tax and social contribution on income due in Brazil.
In addition, permanent differences generated during the period may also impact the Company's effective rate. Such amounts generally refer to non-taxable interest on foreign subsidiaries, tax credits paid abroad, amortization of goodwill in Brazil and tax paid abroad on dividends received by non-integral subsidiaries.
In the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the effective income tax rates were different from the nominal income tax rate in Brazil mainly due to the Company having recorded a net loss in 2023 compared to a net profit in 2022, but also due to the recognition of some permanent differences, such as (1) subsidies for investments that the Company and its subsidiaries have granted by state governments, as ICMS credits - Tax on the Circulation of Goods and Services, which are granted as a stimulus to the implementation or expansion of economic enterprises. In other jurisdictions, the Company receives energy grants and training. When the reduction in income tax expense reflects the deductibility of such incentives, all conditions related to government grants have been met. Subsidies are recognized under the heading ""Sales deductions - Sales tax"" in the income statements; (2) deferred tax not constituted as a result of the reduction of financial expenses and following the policy of analysis of future profitability, the indirect subsidiary Seara Alimentos recorded deferred taxes of tax losses not constituted in previous years, considering the expectation of future taxable profits that will be available to offset such losses. The Company expects that its effective rate will continue to fluctuate in the future due to the impacts of deductions from intercompany financing and other items.

Net Revenue: Changes in Pilgrim's Pride segment net revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 compared to 2022 primarily result from the following factors:
<table><tr><td></td><td>
Effect of exchange variation: Net revenue decreased by R$3,000.0 million as a result primarily of the appreciation of the Real against the US dollar resulting in losses in the consolidation of operations in the United States;
 </td></tr></table><table><tr><td></td><td>
Organic net revenue: Organic net revenue were impacted by a 3.6% decrease in average sales prices, which includes the impact of the Euro, British pound and Mexican peso to U.S. dollar exchange rates. The decrease in average sales prices was partially offset by an increase in sales volumes in 2023 as compared to 2022.

Other factors that may impact the results of the Company's operations include outbreaks of animal diseases, product contamination or recall, the Company's ability to implement its business plan (including ability to provide financing when necessary and on reasonable terms), and the implementation of the Company's financing strategy and expense plan.
Impacts of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine:
The Russia-Ukraine war began in February 2022. The impact of the ongoing war and sanctions will not be limited to companies operating in Russia and Ukraine and could negatively impact other global economic markets, including where we operate. Impacts have included and may continue to include but are not limited to higher commodity prices such as food, ingredients and energy products, rising inflation in some countries and disruption of trade and supply chains. The conflict disrupted shipments of grain, vegetable oils, fertilizers and energy products.
The impact on agricultural markets falls into two main categories: (i) the effect on Ukrainian agricultural production, since the region is fundamental in global grain production; and (ii) the duration of the interruption in trade flows. Security and financing concerns in the region are restricting the execution of exports, which in turn is forcing demand for grain and oil to find alternative supplies. The duration of the war and related volatility make global markets extremely sensitive to the growing season's climate in other global grain-producing regions and have led to a large risk premium in future prices. Continued volatility in global markets as a result of the war has negatively affected our costs, driving up prices, increasing inflation and increasing pressure on the supply of feed ingredients and energy products in global markets. In the second quarter of 2023, Ukraine grain export volumes continued to recover, but still remain below pre-war volumes. Their supply constraints did not have a material impact on our costs during the second quarter. However, if the Black Sea Grain Initiative remains suspended, supply constraints may worsen materially.
Annex I-31
In addition, the U.S. government and other governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate have imposed sanctions and export controls against Russia, Belarus and their interests and threatened additional sanctions and controls. Our business may be impacted by rising energy prices and the availability of energy during the winter months. The impact of these measures, now and in the future, may adversely affect our business, supply chain or customers.
Also, as highlighted in note 29 of financial instruments of the financial statement of December 31, 2022, the Company and its subsidiaries generate various exposures to market, credit and liquidity risk. Such exposures are controlled in an integrated manner by the Risk Management Board, following guidelines outlined in the Financial and Commodity Risk Management Policy defined by the Risk Management Committee and approved by the Board of Directors. The Risk Control Board is responsible for mapping the risk factors that may lead to harmful financial results in the various areas of the Company and also for proposing strategies to mitigate these exposures. Its proposals are submitted to the Risk Management Committee for evaluation for subsequent submission to the Board of Directors, which oversees the implementation of the new solutions, observing limitations of scope and the guidelines of the Financial and Commodity Risk Management Policy.
Moreover, on October 7, 2023, Hamas attacked Israel, with Israel then declaring war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Escalation or expansion of hostilities, interventions by other groups or nations, the imposition of economic sanctions, disruption of shipping transit in the Straits of Hormuz or other significant trade routes, or similar outcomes could adversely affect the international trade, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Although we do not have manufacturing operations in the affected regions, we are monitoring the development and unfolding of the situation and its potential effects on our sector and operations. As of the date of this annual report, no significant impacts have been measured.
Finally, considering all subsequent events that occurred up to the date of disclosure of the financial statements, no significant effects were identified that could affect the recoverability of the assets, or change the measurement of expected losses of these statements.
Acquisitions
The Company's consolidated income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 have limited comparability with the consolidated income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of the acquisitions of (i) Vivera on June 17, 2021, (ii) Pilgrim's Food Masters on September 27, 2021, (iii) acquisition of Huon on November 17, 2021, (iv) acquisition of Sunnyvalley on December 1, 2021, (v) acquisition of Rivalea on January 4, 2022 and (vi) acquisition of TriOak on December 2, 2022.
In the analysis of operating income made by the Company for the comparison between the periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, net revenue from acquisitions is deducted from organic net revenue. The amount of net revenue from significant acquisitions that we exclude from organic revenue will depend on the measurement period and the date of completion of the acquisition. For example, in our comparison of the period ended December 31, 2022 versus the period ended December 31, 2021, (i) the acquisition of Vivera that was completed on June 17, 2021, the impact of this acquisition was excluded from organic revenue for the period from January 1, 2022 to November 17, 2022; (ii) The acquisition of Pilgrim's Food Masters that was completed on September 27, 2021, the impact of this acquisition was excluded from organic revenue for the period from January 1, 2022 to September 27, 2022, (iii) the acquisition of Huon was completed on November 17, 2021, the impact of this acquisition was excluded from organic revenue for the period from January 1, 2022 to November 17, 2022, (iv) the acquisition of Sunnyvalley was completed on December 1, 2021, the impact of this acquisition was excluded from organic revenue for the period from January 1, 2022 to December 1, 2022 of 2022, and (v) the acquisition of Rivalea was completed on January 4, 2022, the impact of this acquisition was excluded from organic revenue for the period from January 4, 2022 to December 31, 2022 and (vi) the acquisition of TriOak was completed on December 2, 2022, the impact of this acquisition was excluded from organic revenue for the period from December 2, 2022 to December 31, 2022.
Annex I-32
Exchange Rate Variation
As a global company with approximately 87% of revenue generated outside Brazil in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Company's operating results and financial condition were and will continue to be affected by the depreciation or appreciation rate of the Brazilian Real in relation to foreign currencies. Any depreciation or appreciation of the Brazilian real in relation to foreign currencies may affect the Company's revenues, causing a monetary increase or decrease, provided that the other variables remain unchanged. In addition, a substantial portion of the Company's loans and financing are stipulated in foreign currencies. For this reason, any depreciation of the Brazilian Real against foreign currencies may significantly increase the Company's financial expenses and its current and non-current loans and financing stipulated in Brazilian reais. On the other hand, any appreciation of the Real in relation to foreign currencies can significantly decrease current and non-current financial expenses, loans and financing determined in reais.
The effect of currency conversion affects the consolidated revenues and expenses generated by the Company's subsidiaries that have functional currencies other than the real, primarily JBS USA. The revenue adjustment is such that organic net revenue is presented on a constant currency basis, which isolates the effect of currency changes during the period. The effect of currency conversion is calculated by multiplying the income or expense line determined in the functional currency in the current period by the difference in the average exchange rates used to convert the income or expense line in the periods presented.
The average exchange rate of the real/dollar was R$4.99 per US$1.00 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, representing an appreciation of the real of 3.3% in relation to the corresponding period in 2022. The average exchange rate of the real/dollar was R$5.16 per US$1.00 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, representing an appreciation of the real of 4.5% in relation to the corresponding period in 2021.
The final real/dollar exchange rate on December 31, 2023 was R$4.84 per US$1.00, representing an appreciation of the real of 7.2% against the exchange rate on December 31, 2022.
(b) material changes in revenues attributable to the introduction of new products and services, changes in volumes and price changes, exchange rates and inflation.
In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Company's consolidated net operating revenue reduced 2.9% compared to the same period of the previous year, totaling R$363,816.5 million.
Comments on changes in revenues attributable to price changes, exchange rates, inflation, volume changes and introduction of new products and services are made above in section 2.1 (h) - significant changes in each item of the financial statements.
Annex I-33
Sensitivity analysis
In order to provide information on how the risks of exchange rates of the real against the US dollar to which the Company is exposed on December 31, 2023 would behave, the following are possible changes, of 25% and 50%, in the relevant risk variables, in relation to the closing quotations used in the measurement of its financial assets and liabilities, on the base date of these interim financial statements. For the calculation of the effect on the result in a probable scenario, the Company considers it appropriate to use the Value at Risk (VaR) methodology, for a 99% confidence interval and a one-day horizon. The results of this analysis are presented below in R$ thousand.

In the explanatory note to the 2023 Annual Financial Statements number 27 - Financial instruments and risk management - of the Interim Financial Statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company presents the sensitivity analysis of its foreign exchange risks associated with its exposures to other foreign currencies and also sensitivity analysis of its exposures to the main commodities.
c) material impacts of inflation, price variation of the main inputs and products, exchange and interest rates on the issuer's operating result and financial result:
Operating Income
The Company's operating performance may be affected by the cost of acquiring live animals and grains for feeding chickens and pigs, which in turn are impacted by supply and demand, and consequently by inflation, in force in the markets where the company operates. Raw material cost represented approximately 75.9% and 73.9% of the cost of production in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Gross sales revenue is affected by inflation since, in general, the Company passes on part or all of the increases in costs to its customers in the markets in which it operates through price increases. The Company cannot predict, however, whether it will be able to pass on the increase in costs to its customers in the future. Sales in the domestic markets where the Company operates directly represented 75.6% and 74.5% of gross sales revenue in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Gross sales revenue can also be affected by the exchange rate since a significant portion of the Company's sales are destined to the foreign market. Exports represented 24.4% and 25.5% of gross sales operating revenue in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Annex I-34
Financial Result
Foreign exchange variations affected and may continue to affect the financial result and indebtedness in the future, given that the Company has a portion of the indebtedness denominated in foreign currency. On December 31, 2023 and 2023, the indebtedness denominated in foreign currency was R$1,503.2 million on December 31, 2023 and R$7,146.0 million on December 31, 2022 and represented 0.7% and 3.4% of the sum of liabilities and shareholders' equity, respectively.
The Company's market risk exposures are constantly monitored, especially risk factors related to exchange rate variations, interest rates and commodity prices that potentially affect the value of financial assets and liabilities, future cash flows and net investments in operations abroad. In these cases, the Company and its subsidiaries employ financial protection instruments, including derivatives, provided that they are approved by the Risk Management Committee.
In 2023, the Company obtained financial expenses with derivatives of R$411.4 million and financial revenues with exchange rate variations of R$294.6 million. In 2022, the Company obtained financial revenues with derivatives of R$1,797.4 million and financial expenses with exchange rate variations of R$2,206.6 million.
As of December 31, 2023, a portion of the Company's total indebtedness was subject to fluctuations in interest rates, specifically the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, and the Brazil interbank deposit rate (Certificate of Interbank Deposit), or CDI, as published by CETIP and the Long-Term Interest Rate, or TJLP.
Inflation Rates
Most of the countries and regions in which we operate, including the United States, Brazil, Australia, Mexico and Europe, are currently experiencing steep inflation. None of the locations where we operate are experiencing hyperinflation. All segments had inflation in operating costs, especially in labor, freight and transportation of some materials. We also experienced high average selling prices impacted by the current inflationary environment. We responded to inflationary challenges in 2023 by continuing negotiations with clients to recoup the extraordinary costs we face. We also continue to focus on operational initiatives that aim to deliver labor efficiency, improved agricultural performance, and improved yields.
Variation of main inputs and products
Our main raw materials are cattle and feed ingredients for our chicken and pork operations. Raw materials accounted for most of the total cost of goods sold during the year ended December 31, 2022. Changes in the price of cattle, pigs and feed ingredients have a direct impact on operating costs and are based on factors beyond the control of our management, such as climate, supply volume, transportation costs, agricultural policies and others. We seek to protect the price paid for cattle purchased through financial instruments in order to try to protect ourselves from price variations between the date of purchase and the date of delivery. Our risk management department is responsible for mapping JBS Group commodity price exposures and proposing strategies to our risk management committee in order to mitigate such exposures. Biological assets are a very important raw material used by us. In order to maintain the future supply of these materials, we participate in forward contracts to anticipate purchases with suppliers. To complement these forward purchases, we use derivative instruments to mitigate each specific exposure, primarily futures contracts, to mitigate the impact of price fluctuations on inventories and sales contracts. We use the historical average amount spent on raw materials as an indication of the operating value to be protected by firm purchase agreements. The price of cattle, pigs and feed ingredients in domestic markets has fluctuated significantly in the past, and we believe it will continue to fluctuate in the coming years. Any increase in the price of cattle, pigs and feed ingredients and, consequently, in production costs may adversely affect our gross margins and our operating results if we are not able to pass on these price increases to our customers. On the other hand, any reduction in the price of cattle, pigs and feed ingredients and, consequently, our production costs, can positively impact our gross margins and our operating results.
Annex I-35
Exchange
As a global company, our results of operations and financial condition have been and will continue to be exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
Any depreciation or appreciation of the foreign currency exchange rate may impact our revenues, costs and expenses causing monetary increase or decrease, provided that the other variables remain unchanged. In addition, a portion of our loans and financing are denominated in foreign currencies. For this reason, any movement in the exchange rate may significantly increase or decrease our financial expenses and our current and non-current loans and financing. In addition, a portion of our assets, liabilities and revenues, costs and expenses are converted to the United States. Dollars for reporting purposes.
Our risk management department contracts derivative instruments previously approved by our board of directors to protect financial assets and liabilities and future cash flow from commercial activities and net investments in foreign operations. Our board of directors has approved financial instruments to hedge our exposure to loans, investments, interest payments cash flows, export estimation, raw material acquisition and other transactions, whenever they are quoted in currencies other than ours or the functional currency of our subsidiaries. The main exposures to exchange rate risk are in the US. Dollars, Euros, Pounds Sterling, Mexican Pesos and Australian Dollars.
Interest Rate
The Company has assets and primarily liabilities exposed to this risk, in operations linked to indexes such as CDI (Interbank Deposit Certificate), LIBOR (London Interbank Offer Rate), IPCA (Broad National Consumer Price Index) and SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate), among others. The Financial and Commodity Risk Management Policy does not provide mandatory guidelines regarding the proportion of exposures to pre-fixed or post-fixed rates, however, the Risk Control Board constantly monitors market conditions and may propose to the Risk Management Committee strategies involving indexers in order to reduce the Company's global exposure. The Risk Management Committee manages and monitors the Company's transition to transition rates. The Commission assesses the extent to which the contracts refer to LIBOR's cash flows, and whether these contracts will need to be amended as a result of the reform of LIBOR and how to manage the communication on the reform with counterparties. Accordingly, the Commission makes available periodic reports to the Administration of the interest rate risk and the risks arising from the reform of LIBOR.
2.3. Directors' comments on changes in accounting practices/modified opinions and emphases in the auditor's report
a) Changes in accounting practices that have resulted in significant effects on the information set out in paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2
There were no significant changes between the accounting practices adopted in the Company's financial statements in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.
b) Modified opinions and emphases in the auditor's report
There were no reservations or emphases in the Company's independent auditor's report with respect to the Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.
Annex I-36
2.4. Material effects on the financial statements
a) introduction or disposal of operating segment
As of 2022, the Company changed its management structure, and segment information began to be prepared considering JBS Australia as an individual segment. Prior to 2022, JBS Australia was embedded within the JBS Beef North America operating segment.
b) constitution, acquisition or disposal of equity interest
It is part of the Company's business strategy, the acquisition of companies, but the company maintains its current focus on gaining efficiency, both operational and financial, of its operations. Since its foundation, the Company has already made different acquisitions that added revenues from these companies.
Relevant operational events:
The Company uses the acquisition cost accounting allocation method to record business combinations that are not under common control. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated by the sum of the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred on the acquisition date to the former controlling shareholders of the acquiree, and interests issued in exchange for control of the acquiree. Generally, all assets acquired and liabilities incurred and contingent liabilities assumed are initially measured at fair value as of the acquisition date. The Company recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree in an acquisition on an acquisition basis, or at fair value or proportionate share of the non-controlling interest in the amounts recorded in the net assets. Acquisition-related costs are recognized in profit or loss when incurred.
The excess (i) of the consideration transferred; (ii) of the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree (when applicable); and (iii) of the fair value, on the acquisition date, of any previous equity interest in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. When the sum of the three items above is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired, the gain is recognized directly in the income statement for the period as ""Bargaining gain"".
On June 8, 2021, JBS entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of Rivalea Holdings Pty Ltd and 100% of Oxdale Dairy Enterprise Pty Ltd (collectively, ""Rivalea""), a leader in pig breeding and processing in Australia, for an enterprise value of AU$175 million. The acquisition was completed on January 4, 2022.
On November 17, 2021, JBS Global Luxembourg S.à r.l., a subsidiary of JBS, entered into an agreement to acquire control of the Spanish company BioTech Foods, S.L., marking the Company's entry into the cultured protein market. The acquisition was completed on May 9, 2022.
On December 13, 2021, Rigamonti, a subsidiary of JBS, signed an agreement to acquire 100% of the King's Group, an Italian specialty producer, with an investment of 82 million. The acquisition was completed on February 7, 2022.
On December 2, 2022, JBS USA, the Company's indirect controlled subsidiary, entered into an agreement for the acquisition of TriOak Foods, which operates in multiple states of the United States, in the processing of pork and marketing of grains.

On December 22, 2022, the Company disclosed a Material Fact notifying the execution of an agreement to terminate CAM Arbitral Procedure No. 186/2021, in which J&amp;F Investimentos S.A. undertook to pay the Company the amount of R$543,164,722.88 (five hundred and forty-three million, one hundred and sixty-four thousand, seven hundred and twenty-two reais and eighty- eight cents).
An Independent Ad Hoc Committee was formed, composed of five independent members of the Board of Directors, who analyzed the facts related to the arbitration and negotiated the agreement over 6 months, and in the end recommended its unanimous approval.
The transaction involved mutual settlement of indemnities arising from the facts narrated in the Collaboration Agreements entered into by the Company's controllers and former administrators with the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, and ended all claims formulated in the proceeding, including claims related to the merger of Bertin S.A. by the Company, the Blessed Holdings theme, as well as the counterclaims formulated against the Company in a much higher amount, and was approved by the competent Arbitral Tribunal.
It should be noted that the Independent Ad Hoc Committee was duly advised by external lawyers hired independently in all phases of its activities, including in the analysis and negotiation of the agreement. The agreement was approved, also unanimously, by the Board of Directors on December 16, 2022.
Annex I-38
2.5. Non-accounting measurements
a) Specify the value of the non-accounting measurements
In 2023, the Company used Adjusted EBITDA as a non-accounting measurement, as well as in 2022.

Adjusted EBITDA, which can be defined as profits before net financial income (expenses), income tax and social contribution, depreciation and amortization, equity method result and other non-recurring results, is used as a performance measure of the Company's Management.
The Company uses as a non-accounting measure the Adjusted EBITDA (according to Articles 4 and 5 of CVM Instruction No. nº 156 of June 23, 2022) adjusting the equity method result, and other non-recurring results.
The equity method result is allocated under the specific heading of the income statement.
Of the other non-recurring results, the adjusted balances are allocated in the income statement for the year ended December 31, 2022 under the following headings: ""Other revenues"" arising from extemporaneous tax debts and credits and J&amp;F Indemnity - net of PIS/COFINS, on the other hand, the ""other expenses"" related to consulting expenses with corporate restructurings. The other non-recurring results are allocated under the heading of ""general and administrative expenses"", ""cost of products sold"" and ""sales expenses"".
Annex I-39
c) explain why it believes that such a measurement is more appropriate for a correct understanding of its financial condition and the results of its operations
Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under Accounting Practices Adopted in Brazil and IFRS, nor should it be considered in isolation, or as an alternative to net income, as a measure of operating performance, or an alternative to operating cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.
Adjusted EBITDA has no standardized meaning and the Company's definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to that used by other companies. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA acts as a significant tool to periodically compare its operating performance, as well as to support certain administrative decisions. However, it should be noted that, since Adjusted EBITDA does not consider certain costs intrinsic to the Company's business, which could, in turn, significantly affect its profits, such as financial expenses, taxes, depreciation, capital expenditures and other corresponding charges, Adjusted EBITDA presents limitations that affect its use as an indicator of the Company's profitability.
In an overview, Adjusted EBITDA is additional information to our financial statements and should not be used to replace audited results, and may not be comparable with the same indicators disclosed by other companies.

d) opportunities embedded in the issuer's business plan related to ESG issues
On 2023, the Company continued fomenting ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) initiatives that provided opportunities in its business. Among them, the promotion of the circular economy, a strategic concept that aims to ensure the reduction, reuse, recovery and recycling of materials and energies, creating an economic cycle driven by the least possible disposal and waste. At JBS, this approach has given rise to new businesses for more than 15 years and to disruptive solutions that contribute to the Company's continuity of activities. A part of our business model, influencing long-term decision making, promoting a circular system that provides for the reuse and recycling of waste. A clear example of how the circular economy is applied in our business is in the cattle chain. Over the last two decades, we have developed a series of initiatives to give an adequate and sustainable destination, and with a focus to generate value to the waste from the process of animal protein production, such as tallow, skin and bovine serum. These by-products are transformed into biodiesel, collagen for the food and neutraceutics industry and soaps, contributing to the sustainable use of natural resources and benefiting the environment. This effort translates into large numbers, we are the world's largest verticalized producers of biodiesel from beef tallow. We also export to more than 40 countries another input, functional collagen, used in the food industry, with protein bases to serve different segments, such as sausages and breads. Another sector in which we operate is hygiene and cleaning products, in which we are leaders in the production of bar soaps in the B2B segment in Brazil, with 60% of the soap bars originating from beef tallow. We are also global leaders in the beef leather reuse segment - an activity that has as a positive social impact the generation of income for people in vulnerability situation. We are pioneers in Brazil to use organic waste generated in our factories to produce organic and organomineral fertilizers.
Through Biolins, a cogeneration unit, JBS also produces electricity and steam from biomass (sugarcane bagasse, eucalyptus chips and various biomass). With a processing potential of 600 thousand tons/year of raw material, it has a generation capacity of 45 megawatts hour (MW/h), a volume sufficient to supply a city of 300 thousand inhabitants. Biolins supplies 100% of electricity and steam to the Friboi, JBS Couros and JBS Novos Negócios factories in the Lins industrial park itself. Alone, the plant generates the equivalent of 16% of the total electrical energy used by all JBS units in Brazil. Finally, No Carbon, a new JBS business focused on renting electric trucks, began operations in 2022, providing logistical support to JBS's businesses in Brazil.
With an investment of R$54 million, JBS implemented in Brazil, in 2023, biodigester systems in nine Friboi facilities for the production of biogas, allowing the production of approximately 53 thousand m³/day of biogas, this is the largest project type in the protein industry in the country, reducing the environmental impact of its production process. Currently, 14 factories in the United States and Canada already have biodigester systems, producing 190 thousand m³/d of biogas. This clean energy powers boilers and is used to produce electricity in the Company's units, in addition to being sold to gas companies. Projects in operation in the USA and Canada reduced external demand for natural gas by 20%.
At JBS USA, nearly 100% of inedible by-products are destined for the production of tallow and blood-and-bone meal, which are sold to other companies for use in the manufacture of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, and in animal feed.
The maturity of management within the scope of sustainability at JBS has gained market recognition. In 2021, the Company carried out four fundraisings linked to its sustainability goals (reduction in emissions and number of livestock farmers who joined the Transparent Livestock Platform), raising US$3.2 billion. Other ESG opportunities included in JBS' business plan are reported in the Company's Sustainability Report and HUB ESG.

 8.1. Compensation Practice or Policy
a) objectives of the compensation policy or practice, informing if the compensation policy was formally approved, the body responsible for its approval, approval date, and, if the issuer discloses the policy, the websites where the document can be found
The Company's compensation policy for its management, including members of the Board of Directors, Fiscal Council, and statutory and non-statutory directors, aims to attract and retain market professionals who have qualifications, skills and profile suited to JBS's practices and business.
Compensation is established based according to market research and is directly linked to the alignment of the interests of the executives with the interests of JBS. The Company's compensation policy is approved by its Board of Directors, as recommended by the Governance, Compensation and Nomination Committee and the variable compensation policy (PPR) is based on the agreement with the workers' union.
As part of the structure for monitoring executive compensation, JBS's Governance, Compensation and Nomination Committee analyzes, according to needs and demands, the evaluation metrics of management members.
The Company's current compensation guidelines were formally approved at the Board of Directors' Meeting on November 11, 2020. JBS' Compensation Policy is available for consultation on its website (https://ri.jbs.com.br/) and on the websites of the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission - CVM (www.cvm.gov.br) and B3 S.A. - Brasil, Bolsa Balcão (www.b3.com.br).
b) practices and procedures adopted by board of directors to determine the individual compensation of the board of directors and board of executive officers
(i) the issuer's bodies and committees that participate in the decision-making process and how they do so
The Statutory Audit Committee and the Company's Governance, Compensation and Nomination Committee submit to the Board of Directors a proposal for the overall annual compensation of its management. After approved by the Company's Board of Directors, the proposal is submitted for approval to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. After approved by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the overall annual management compensation is segregated by the Board of Directors among the members (Board of Directors and Statutory Board of Directors).
(ii) criteria and methodology used to establish individual remuneration, indicating if studies are used to verify market practices, and, if so, the comparison criteria and the scope of these studies
For fixed compensation, JBS analyzes market research carried out by specialized consultancy, including for annual inflation adjustment.
Just as for all the Company's employees, the performance indicators for executives are: achievement of operational and financial goals and individual performance of each executive.
(iii) frequency and how the board of directors assess the adequacy of the issuer's compensation policy
The Governance, Compensation and Nomination Committee, an advisory body to the Board of Directors, assesses the Company's compensation guidelines and practices, formulating recommendations to the Board of Directors and periodically reviewing the corporate governance policies and practices adopted by the Company.

 Compensation is readjusted to inflation for the period, appreciation in share price (part of the variable compensation, as detailed below) and goals met, which is part of the performance evaluation process.
Furthermore, the fixed monthly compensation for the statutory and non-statutory directors is adjusted in all fiscal years, according to the percentages of the collective workers' agreements and other adjustments based on merit in the performance of their activities. Adjustments to compensation for the members of the Board of Directors, when they occur, are based on comparative market studies carried out by specialized consulting firms.
The variable compensation for the Company's directors considers the adjusted net income recorded by the Company, as well as an individual performance evaluation process, in the 360º model, which assessed behavioral performance and individual results.
The health plan offered by the Company to the members of the statutory board does not have a specific calculation and adjustment methodology, since it is determined by the insurance company.
Share-based compensation, which is granted to members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board, considers the evolution of the Company's share price and has its own calculation methodology, as described in the long-term variable compensation.
Annex III-3

a) General terms and conditions
The Company's Stock Option Plan was approved at the Annual and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting on April 30, 2014 (""Plan

8.18. Compensation - other roles
The Company did not recognize in its results during the last 3 fiscal years, and there is no amount provisioned in the current fiscal year, of any other compensation other than the ones previously informed in item 8.2.
8.19. Remuneration recognized in the controlling/controlled company
Not applicable
8.20. Other relevant information
The Company submitted to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, as a proposal for its annual and overall compensation for management and individual members of the Fiscal Council and the Statutory Audit Committee for the fiscal year of 2024, on an accrual basis, in the amount of up to R$269,342,164.59 (two hundred and sixty-nine million, three hundred and forty-two thousand, one hundred and sixty-four reais and fifty-nine cents). It is important to highlight, however, that this amount covers the compensation of independent members of the Statutory Audit Committee who are not members of the Company's Board of Directors and/or the Executive Board and/or Fiscal Council - so that the difference between (i) the value submitted to the shareholders' meeting and (ii) the expected compensation for the 2023 financial year indicated in item 8.2 above refers precisely to the compensation of the independent members of the Statutory Audit Committee.
Regarding the number of paid members of the Fiscal Council, indicated in item 8.2., the Company clarifies that one of the members of this body renounced his remuneration in 2023 and also for the 2024 fiscal year.
There is no other information deemed relevant by the Company to be disclosed in this section 8.

Mayaro virus (MAYV) is a mosquito-borne Alphavirus that is widespread in South America. MAYV infection often presents with non-specific febrile symptoms but may progress to debilitating chronic arthritis or arthralgia. Despite the pandemic threat of MAYV, its true distribution remains unknown. The objective of this study was to clarify the geographic distribution of MAYV using an established risk mapping framework. This consisted of generating evidence consensus scores for MAYV presence, modeling the potential distribution of MAYV in select countries across Central and South America, and estimating the population residing in areas suitable for MAYV transmission. We compiled a georeferenced compendium of MAYV occurrence in humans, animals, and arthropods. Based on an established evidence consensus framework, we integrated multiple information sources to assess the total evidence supporting ongoing transmission of MAYV within each country in our study region. We then developed high resolution maps of the diseases estimated distribution using a boosted regression tree approach. Models were developed using nine climatic and environmental covariates that are related to the MAYV transmission cycle. Using the output of our boosted regression tree models, we estimated the total population living in regions suitable for MAYV transmission. The evidence consensus scores revealed high or very high evidence of MAYV transmission in several countries including Brazil (especially the states of Mato Grosso and Goiás), Venezuela, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, and French Guiana. According to the boosted regression tree models, a substantial region of South America is suitable for MAYV transmission, including north and central Brazil, French Guiana, and Suriname. Some regions (e.g., Guyana) with only moderate evidence of known transmission were identified as highly suitable for MAYV. We estimate that approximately 58.9 million people (95% CI: 21.4100.4) in Central and South America live in areas that may be suitable for MAYV transmission, including 46.2 million people (95% CI: 17.668.9) in Brazil. Our results may assist in prioritizing high-risk areas for vector control, human disease surveillance and ecological studies.

Introduction
Mayaro virus (MAYV) is a mosquito-borne Alphavirus that was first detected in Trinidad in 1954 [1]. MAYV has caused periodic outbreaks throughout Latin America [2] and serological surveys and syndromic surveillance studies suggest widespread circulation in the region [3]. Some researchers have hypothesized that MAYV has broader epidemic potential and raised alarm about its apparent increased geographic spread [4, 5].
MAYV can cause debilitating arthralgia or arthritis that can persist for months after initial infection [6]. However, MAYV often results in non-specific febrile symptoms that are similar to other vector borne diseases such as dengue or Zika [7]. Therefore, clinical diagnosis is often difficult and accurate estimates of disease burden remain elusive. This is further complicated by the many limitations of serological diagnostics including the cross-reactivity of antigenically similar viruses [8]. Supportive care remains the current standard of clinical treatment for MAYV as no licensed vaccine or antiviral treatment currently exists.
Limited studies on MAYV ecology suggest that this virus is maintained in a sylvatic transmission cycle involving arboreal mosquito vectors and non-human animal reservoirs. High seroprevalence among non-human primates (NHPs) [9] suggests they may be involved in the MAYV transmission cycle, although their precise role is inconclusive. In addition, MAYV antibodies have been detected in other mammals including rodents and marsupials [10]. Risk factors, such as living in close proximity to forested areas [11] and hunting in the rainforest [12] have been linked to MAYV infection in humans. This underscores the significance of the sylvatic transmission cycle and the potential for spillover events. However, MAYV occurrence in urban environments such as Manaus, Brazil has led to concerns about an urban transmission cycle driven by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes [13]. Though studies of wild-caught mosquito populations implicated the canopy-dwelling Haemagogus (Hag.) janthinomys mosquito as the primary vector during a major outbreak in Brazil [9], Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus have demonstrated the potential to transmit MAYV in laboratory settings [14].
A prior epidemiological alert by the Pan American Health Association (PAHO) stressed the importance of heightened awareness and expanded surveillance of MAYV in Central and South America [15]. Ideally, MAYV spillover and outbreak prevention would be guided by granular maps of MAYV risk enabling targeted febrile surveillance and ecological surveillance efforts and better tailored risk communications to endemic populations and travelers. However, the precise areas of risk from MAYV remain unclear due to limited data on MAYV occurrence [16], underscoring a fundamental need for a more comprehensive and georeferenced dataset on MAYV occurrence.
Here, we provide a significant update to the current state of knowledge on MAYV transmission risk across Central and South America. We adopted a well-established machine-learning based disease mapping approach originally developed by ecologists to model species distributions but has since been successfully applied to several medically-relevant vector-borne pathogens [1719]. These methods are particularly powerful for leveraging biological and ecological information underpinning a sylvatic disease system to generate biologically realistic and spatially explicit predictions when epidemiological data are still sparse. Many of these models rely on machine learning techniques including boosted regression trees (BRT) [20] to develop a multivariate relationship between disease occurrence locations and relevant climatic or environmental covariates that impact disease transmission.
In order to develop a contemporary estimate of MAYV risk in Central and South America, we applied a predictive mapping approach with three components: (1) scoring the total evidence supporting ongoing MAYV transmission within each country (i.e., evidence consensus scores); (2) modeling the likely distribution of MAYV suitability throughout Central and South America; (3) estimating the total population residing in areas with a high suitability for MAYV transmission. Compared to previous estimates, these updated datasets and analyses suggest that MAYV poses a substantial and possibly underestimated threat to Central and South America.
Methods
Evidence consensus
Collating published reports of MAYV is an important first step in clarifying its distribution. However, heterogeneous surveillance across countries and incomplete or unclear reporting of epidemiological data may impact our ability to definitively say that MAYV is present in a certain location. An evidence consensus approach takes several information sources into account in order to score the total available evidence supporting the presence or absence of a disease in a given country. This approach has been used previously to provide a refined description of the spatial limits of several pathogens including dengue [21], leishmaniasis [22], podoconiosis [23], and Lassa fever [24]. These studies considered multiple data sources to develop an evidence consensus score for disease presence or absence, including health organization status, peer reviewed evidence, case data, animal infection, economic status, and other supplementary evidence. We followed a similar procedure to generate a consensus score for each country in Latin America that quantifies the evidence supporting MAYV presence. This score ranged from 0 (No evidence of MAYV presence) to 21 (Complete evidence of MAYV presence) based on the categories described below (see Table 1 for a summary of categories and possible scores).
Health organization reports (max 3 points).
International health organizations have been used previously to support evidence of pathogen presence or absence in specific countries [21]. We followed a similar procedure, using health reports from two sources: Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)/World Health Organization (WHO) and the Global Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology Online Network (GIDEON). The PAHO issues weekly epidemiological alerts to update the public on the occurrence of significant health events. Similarly, the WHO issues Disease Outbreak News (DONs) related to public health issues of international importance. We searched these PAHO/WHO bulletins for relevant alerts related to MAYV in a given country. Countries were assigned a score of 1 if WHO/PAHO had issued an epidemiological alert for MAYV in that country.
GIDEON is a web application that compiles relevant news on infectious disease outbreaks and designates countries as endemic/potentially endemic for each pathogen. If a country was listed as endemic/potentially endemic for MAYV in the GIDEON database, it was assigned a score of 1. If a country fulfilled both criteria (i.e., listed as endemic in GIDEON and a relevant PAHO/WHO health alert) it was assigned a score of 3.
Peer-reviewed evidence of human infection (max 6 points).
Based on methods proposed by Brady et al., [21] peer-reviewed evidence of human infection was scored based on the following two categories: contemporariness (3 for 20112021, 2 for 20002010, and 1 for 1999 and earlier) and diagnostic accuracy (3 for PCR, viral culture, or PRNT, 2 for other serological methods only, 1 for presumed cases without diagnostic test or cases with unspecified diagnostic test). In the case of multiple MAYV reports in a given country, the highest scoring report was used. For example, if one study in Brazil reported serological evidence of MAYV transmission (score of 2) in 1990 (score of 1) and another study in Brazil reported MAYV viral culture (score of 3) in 2019 (score of 3), Brazil would receive a score of 6 for this category. We also considered returning traveler reports for this category if the case was definitively linked to the country of travel. These reports are useful for establishing evidence of pathogen presence because diagnosis may be done more rigorously for travelers upon returning to their country of origin [21]. Data was compiled in a systematic review that was previously described [25].
Outbreaks and clinical cases (max 6 points).
Reported outbreaks of MAYV or clinical cases that were detected using PCR were scored according to total case numbers and contemporariness. Previous studies have used only the occurrence of reported outbreaks (with no consideration to clinical cases) to assign a score for this category [21]. However, because only a limited number of MAYV outbreaks have occurred and because diagnostic techniques have been inconsistent across these outbreaks, we also considered clinical cases diagnosed by PCR or viral culture that were not necessarily considered to be an outbreak. The scoring system for this category was adapted based on methods used by Mylne et al., [24] where higher scores were assigned to contemporary reports with 20 or more cases. In order to calculate a score for each country, we summed the cases detected across multiple studies within a single time period. For example, if two separate reports from Peru each detected 10 cases of MAYV using PCR between 2011 and 2021, we summed the reported cases (20 total) and assigned Peru 6 points for this category. However, cases from multiple reports were not summed across different time periods. Data was compiled in a systematic review that was previously described [25].
A lack of MAYV case reports in a given country is not necessarily indicative of a lack of virus transmission. It is likely that MAYV cases may go undetected due to variable surveillance or diagnostic capacity. We attempted to account for this uncertainty using healthcare expenditure (HE) as a proxy of a countrys capacity for detecting MAYV occurrence. If no outbreaks or clinical cases were reported in a given country, we used the current HE per capita from the World Health Organization 2017 dataset. Total HE for each country was designated as low (HE &lt; $100), medium ($100 HE &lt; $500), or high (HE $500) according to methods that were previously described [21]. We also considered a countrys proximity to other countries that have reported outbreaks or clinical cases diagnosed by PCR [24]. Adjacency to countries with outbreaks or clinical cases was combined with HE to assign a score. The highest score was assigned to countries with MAYV outbreaks/clinical cases in two or more neighboring countries and a low HE.
Animal and arthropod data (max 6 points).
Detection of MAYV occurrence in non-human animal or arthropod species provides additional evidence of MAYV presence. This may be indicative of the potential for disease spillover into the human population. Previous studies have considered the presence of competent vector species when calculating the evidence consensus score [19, 26]. However, because of uncertainties regarding the role of various mosquitoes in the MAYV transmission cycle (e.g., the possible role of Aedes aegypti in urban transmission [13]), we considered reports of any wild-caught arthropods that were identified as MAYV positive. Similarly, we assigned a separate score based on reports of infection in potential animal reservoirs. The highest scores for both animal and arthropod MAYV positivity were assigned to more contemporary studies. In the case of multiple MAYV reports in a given country, the highest scoring report was used. All data on MAYV positivity in non-human animals and arthropods was compiled in a systematic review that was previously described [27].
In order to provide more granular data throughout Brazil, we also calculated evidence scores by state (i.e., first-administrative division). Because health organization status was not available for each state, we assigned a baseline score of one to each state, and then calculated the remaining categories according to the methods described above.
Occurrence records
We previously developed and published a georeferenced compendium of MAYV occurrence [25] based on methods that have been established for other pathogens including dengue and leishmaniasis [2831]. MAYV occurrence among humans, non-human animals, and arthropods was compiled through a systematic review of the literature, including an evaluation of the quality of such evidence. These methods were described previously in greater detail [25, 27]. All occurrences were assigned to a point or polygon location, depending on the spatial resolution provided by the authors. Point data comprised precise locations with less than 5km of uncertainty (e.g., specific coordinates or a small town) while polygon data comprised larger areas or administrative units that exceeded 5km of uncertainty. The coordinates of point locations and polygon centroids were recorded in our database and used as the presence records in our current modeling study.
Presence points with 75km of uncertainty were included in our current analysis, although the majority of points had substantially less uncertainty. Following a previously published modeling study that accepted up to 65km of uncertainty [32], we chose to accept a greater level of uncertainty in our occurrence data in order to include more occurrence locations during the model development process. Due to the limited size of our occurrence dataset, we deemed that the extra information gained from each occurrence record outweighed any issues associated with the greater uncertainty of some occurrence records.
The final MAYV database contained 262 unique georeferences in 15 countries, published between 1954 and 2022. This data is available in the Dryad data repository [33]. One hundred and ninety-five of these occurrence points fell within our study region and met the 75km uncertainty threshold, and thus were eligible for inclusion in our model. We used the spThin package in the R statistical software to reduce clustering of presence records [34]. A 5km distance threshold was applied to ensure that no more than one presence point occurred within each pixel of our covariate layers.
Description of covariates
We considered 10 ecologically relevant gridded variables (i.e., raster data) for inclusion in our model. These variables included various measures of topography, climate, land cover and vegetation that likely influence the MAYV transmission cycle and the distribution of MAYV risk throughout the region. Several variables were derived from NASAs Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing platform [35]. These MODIS variables (plus an additional rainfall variable) were provided by the Malaria Atlas Project (https://malariaatlas.org/) after a gap-filling algorithm was used to account for cloud cover [36]. The variables were transformed to ensure matching spatial resolution of 2.5 arc-minutes (~5km) and matching extent. Values for the variables were extracted at each presence/pseudoabsence location and used in the modelling procedure described below.
Temperature and rainfall play an important role in vector abundance and activity [37]. Entomological surveys have demonstrated an association between Hg. janthinomys abundance and temperature [38, 39] and Alencar et al. reported that the mosquitos presence was correlated with high temperatures ranging from 24°C30°C [40]. Several studies have also demonstrated that large diurnal temperature range can impact larval development time, adult survival, and reproductive output in Aedes and Anopheles populations [4143] and an ecological niche model demonstrated that mean diurnal range was one of the most important predictors of Hg. janthinomys distribution [44]. Humidity and rainfall have also been shown to impact the density of adult Hg. janthinomys mosquito populations [38, 4548] and Hg. janthinomys biting activity was shown to peak during intense rainfall in January [46]. Due to the impact of temperature and rainfall on vector abundance and vectorial capacity, we included three climate variables in our model, namely night-time and daytime land surface temperature (LST) and cumulative rainfall. LST Night and LST Day are remotely sensed variables from the NASA MODIS MOD11A2 satellite [49]. Annual LST Day and LST Night raster layers spanning the years 20002020 were used to calculate a single layer representing the mean values over this time period. We also used rainfall data from the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) [50], a quasi-global data set that incorporates satellite imagery at 0.05° resolution and meteorological station data to construct gridded rainfall estimates.
In addition, Hg. janthinomys mosquitoes thrive in arboreal habitats (e.g., tropical rainforests) and oviposit in water-filled natural plant cavities (e.g., tree holes or broken bamboo) [51]. Adult mosquitoes have predominantly been found in the forest canopy at heights of 16m and 30m [38]. Therefore, the density of vegetation canopy and moisture supply may influence Hg. janthinomys abundance in a given area. To account for these factors, we included three covariates related to vegetation and surface moisture: enhanced vegetation index (EVI), tasseled cap wetness (TCW) and tasseled cap brightness (TCB). The EVI is a measure of vegetation canopy greenness displayed at a 500m spatial resolution [52] and is derived from the MODIS MCD43B4 product [53]. The EVI has been used as a covariate in previous environmental suitability models of arboviruses including Yellow Fever [54], chikungunya virus [19], and Zika virus [18]. TCW and TCB, measures of surface moisture that are used to assess land cover change, were also generated from the MODIS MCD43B4 product [55].
Previous outbreaks of MAYV have occurred in towns close to the rainforest or jungle outposts in close proximity to the forest edge [2, 12, 56]. MAYV most likely circulates in a sylvatic cycle involving canopy-dwelling mosquitoes and non-human primates, with occasional spill-overs into humans living close to the forest [9]. Entomological surveys have demonstrated that Hg. janthinomys are predominantly found in forest canopies at heights of 16m and 30m [38]. Due to the strong impact of land cover on the probability of MAYV occurrence in a given area, we included two land cover covariates, namely evergreen broadleaf forest and urban/built-up, from the MODIS MOD13Q1 product [57, 58]. These covariates represent the proportion of each raster grid cell (ranging from 0100) that is covered by the land cover class in question, whereby a value of zero represents the absence of land cover and 100 represents complete coverage. Lastly, we included slope and elevation covariates that we accessed from the US Geological Surveys Global Multi-resolution Terrain Elevation Data (GMTED) [59]. Elevation represents the meters above sea level at a given location. Slope values range from 0 (flat) to 90 degrees (vertical) and represent the angle of the downward sloping terrain.
We implemented a data-driven variable selection process in the R package SDMtune to identify variables for inclusion in our models. This process involves removal of highly correlated variables based on an algorithm that first ranks the variables by permutation importance and evaluates the correlation between the most important variable and the remaining variables. A leave-one-out Jack-knife test is then used to remove the variable that has the smallest impact on model performance according to the AUC. Based on this analysis, we removed TCW from the final model. Maps of the variables included in the model are presented in Fig 1.

Mapping environmental suitability for MAYV occurrence
Environmental suitability models are common in the epidemiological literature to model human disease risk. A robust disease mapping framework has been established in the last decade to model the environmental suitability for medically-relevant pathogens including dengue virus [17], Chikungunya virus [19] and Zika virus [18], among others.
We used BRT to model the environmental suitability for MAYV occurrence across our study region. This algorithm uses regression or classification trees to partition the dataset using recursive binary splits. It also incorporates boosting into the model-building process, a procedure that combines many simple models to improve overall model accuracy. The boosting algorithm is an iterative process that fits many small trees sequentially, building on previously fitted trees to improve model performance [20]. This process incorporates a level of stochasticity by randomly selecting a subset of the data to fit each tree, thereby reducing the model variance [20]. BRT have several advantages including their ability to fit complex nonlinear relationships, handle missing data, and to accommodate many different types of covariates without any need for data transformation [20].
One of the most important aspects of modeling species distributions with presence-only data is the selection of pseudo-absence points that represent the range of environmental conditions where the species or pathogen was not detected. Random selection of pseudo-absence points may not be appropriate if the presence locations are spatially biased [60]. In most cases, the detection of disease presence locations may be subject to sampling bias if some locations are more likely to be surveyed than others (e.g., locations that are closer to roads) [61]. Therefore, pseudo-absence points should be selected with a similar level of bias as the presence points to ensure that background and presence locations are biased in the same manner [61]. Following the methods of previous modeling studies [24, 6264], we selected 10,000 background points from the study region, biased towards more populous areas. Therefore, population density was used as a proxy for sampling bias. Pseudoabsence points were selected using the 2° method proposed by Barbet-Massin (2012) [65], whereby each pseudo-absence point was at least 2° away from a presence location. In order to improve the models discrimination capacity, the pseudoabsence points were down-weighted to ensure that the weighted sum of presence records equaled the sum of weighted background points [65].
We subsequently fitted 100 BRT sub-models to separate bootstraps of the dataset. The bootstrapped datasets were chosen with replacement, subject to the condition that a minimum of 25 presence and 25 pseudo-absence points were selected. This bootstrapping procedure allowed us to quantify the uncertainty across models and to increase the models robustness [66]. Each sub-model was fit in R using the gbm.step procedure in the dismo package [67]. This function uses cross-validation to identify the optimal number of trees for each sub-model to improve predictive capacity. The remaining BRT hyperparameters were held at their default values (tree complexity = 4, learning rate = 0.005, bag fraction = 0.75, cross-validation folds = 10, step size = 10). The final prediction map represents the mean MAYV suitability of each 5 x 5 km pixel across our ensemble of 100 models along with the lower 2.5th percentile and 97.5th percentile predictions. We also generated a map of the model uncertainty, represented by per-pixel standard deviation. In order to avoid extrapolating the model far outside of regions of known MAYV transmission, the model predictions were restricted to the following countries in Central and South America with moderate, high, or very high evidence of MAYV transmission based on evidence consensus scores: Panama, Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana and Bolivia.
The predictive accuracy of the model was assessed using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, Kappa statistic, and percent correctly classified (PCC). Metrics were calculated for each sub-model using 10-fold cross validation. The cross-validation procedure involved randomly splitting each bootstrapped dataset into 10 folds with approximately the same number of presence and absence records in each fold. The model was subsequently trained on nine of the folds and the withheld fold was used to evaluate the model performance. The performance metrics for each sub-model represent the mean values across the 10 folds. These values were then averaged across each of the sub-models to generate an estimate of overall model performance. We also calculated relative importance scores for each of the covariates. Relative importance was defined according to the relative percent contribution, which quantifies how often the model selects a variable for splitting. The scores are weighted by the squared improvement to model performance and averaged across all trees [20].
Total population living in areas with high predicted MAYV suitability
We estimated the total human population living in areas of high predicted MAYV suitability. We first transformed the mean prediction map into a binary risk map using a previously established protocol [18], whereby a suitability threshold value was chosen that encompassed 90% of the MAYV occurrence points. Each 5 x 5 km pixel was classified as 1 (i.e., suitable) if its predicted suitability exceeded the threshold value; otherwise, it was classified as 0 (i.e., not suitable). We then determined the total population residing in suitable areas by multiplying the population count within each grid cell by the binary suitability classification and summing these values across each country. We used population count data from the Gridded Population of the World (GPW) version 4 [68]. Furthermore, we calculated uncertainty in these population estimates (i.e., 95% confidence intervals) using the 2.5% (lower) and 97.5% (upper) bounds of the BRT model prediction. Following Deribe et al. [69], we also conducted a sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of alternative suitability thresholds on the estimated population residing in suitable transmission zones.
Results
The map of evidence consensus is presented in Fig 2A and the evidence score for each country is presented by category in the S1 and S2 Tables. Evidence consensus scores ranged from 0 (no evidence of MAYV transmission) to 19 (very high evidence of transmission). We recorded a very high evidence consensus score for Brazil and Venezuela, with scores of 19 and 16, respectively. Other countries with a high evidence consensus score included Peru (Evidence Consensus = 15), French Guiana and Trinidad and Tobago (Evidence Consensus = 13 for both), and Colombia and Bolivia (Evidence Consensus = 11 for both). We recorded evidence consensus scores ranging from very low to moderate in all Central American and Caribbean countries. Among these countries with low to moderate risk, the highest evidence consensus scores were documented for Haiti (Evidence Consensus = 10) and Panama (Evidence Consensus = 9).

Scores are based on health organization status, date of most recent MAYV occurrence; validity of MAYV diagnostic test, recency of MAYV outbreaks or clinical cases, and recency of MAYV occurrence in animals or arthropods. Blue represents very low evidence consensus while red represents very high evidence consensus. Maps were created in R using shape files from the Natural Earth public domain repository (http://www.naturalearthdata.com/).

Evidence consensus scores for Brazilian first-level administrative divisions are presented in Fig 2B. Evidence of MAYV transmission was highest in the central Brazilian states of Mato Grosso and Goiás, both with very high scores of 16. High evidence of MAYV was also documented in five Northern and Central states, including Pará and Bahia (Evidence Consensus = 14 for both), Roraima (Evidence Consensus = 13), Piauí (Evidence Consensus = 12), and Mato Grosso do Sul (Evidence Consensus = 11).
Fig 3 displays the 195 MAYV occurrences (human, animal, and arthropod) that were used to fit our model. The occurrence locations fell in 10 countries, most frequently in Brazil (n = 101), French Guiana (n = 25) and Peru (n = 21). MAYV occurrences were reported between the years 1954 and 2021, with the majority of cases (n = 133) occurring since the year 2000. One hundred fifty-two (78%) of the occurrence locations were detected in humans while 43 (22%) were detected in non-human animals or arthropods.

Maps of the predicted distribution of MAYV environmental suitability, along with the lower (2.5%) and upper (97.5%) of the prediction limits, are presented in Fig 4. This risk map represents the average output across the 100 BRT sub-models. The map of model uncertainty (i.e., the per-pixel standard deviation across the 100 model runs) is presented in the S1 Fig High suitability for MAYV transmission was evident across the Amazon rainforest ecoregion in South America. The model predicted very high suitability for MAYV across a large portion of Central and Northern Brazil, especially the states of Amazonas, Acre, Pará, and Tocantins. High suitability was also predicted throughout French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago, as well as the southern portion of Colombia and Venezuela, and the north-eastern region of Peru and northern region of Bolivia. The southern region of Panama was also found to be highly suitable for MAYV transmission. After applying pairwise distance sampling to remove spatial sorting bias, the model demonstrated good predictive power with an AUC of 0.83. Other statistics from the 10-fold cross-validation procedure included the following: PCC = 87%, sensitivity = 0.82, specificity = 0.93, and Kappa = 0.75.
Fig 4. Map of environmental suitability and prediction uncertainty for MAYV occurrence.
Suitability ranged from blue (0no suitability) to red (1very high suitability). We obtained the lower and upper bound of MAYV presence limits by fitting an ensemble of 100 BRT submodels. The base map was sourced from Global Administrative Areas (GADM) version 4.0: https://gadm.org/download_country.html.

Our models showed MAYV suitability to be especially influenced by climatic variables including rainfall, with a relative importance of 34.5 (95% CI: 28.341.6) and nighttime LST, with a relative importance of 29.6 (95% CI: 24.434.0). Relative percent contributions for the remaining variables were 9.0 for elevation (95% CI: 6.212.8), 6.9 for EVI (95% CI: 5.18.9), 5.9 for urban land cover (95% CI: 4.47.6), 4.9 for daytime LST (95% CI: 3.86.5), 4.0 for evergreen land cover (95% CI: 2.55.7), 3.3 for TCB (95% CI: 2.14.9) and 1.9 for slope (95% CI: 0.73.5). The partial dependence plots for the covariates are presented in Fig 5. The partial dependence plot for nighttime LST reveals a steep increase in MAYV suitability around ~15°C that peaks at ~22°C and then falls. The plot for rainfall reveals a similarly steep increase starting at ~100mm that plateaus and then decreases around ~300mm, with only a minor peak at ~375mm.

We identified 0.53 as the threshold suitability value that encompassed 90% of the MAYV occurrence locations. We applied this conservative value to classify pixels as either suitable or unsuitable for MAYV transmission. A summary of the population living in potentially suitable MAYV transmission zones is presented in Table 2. Overall, we estimate that approximately 58.9 million people (95% CI: 21.4100.4) in Central and South America live in areas that are potentially suitable for MAYV transmission. Countries with the greatest population living in suitable transmission zones include 46.2 million in Brazil (95% CI: 17.668.9), 3.5 million in Colombia (95% CI: 0.611.0), and 2.4 million in Panama (95% CI: 1.43.1). The majority of the Brazilian population living in suitable areas reside in the Amazon rainforest ecoregion. For our sensitivity analysis, we used lower (0.4) and higher (0.6) suitability values [69] to dichotomize the final map as suitable or unsuitable, and subsequently calculated the total population living in suitable transmission zones. Based on these alternate suitability values, the total population would be 77.2 million (95% CI: 35.7120.6) and 49.8 million (95% CI: 16.591.3) for the 0.4 and 0.6 values, respectively.
Discussion
In this paper we present an ensemble BRT model of MAYV environmental suitability in Central and South America and an evidence consensus framework that integrates multiple information sources. Such suitability models can serve an important role in guiding arboviral surveillance (in humans and other hosts, including informing regional laboratory-based surveillance) and targeting vector control efforts. This is especially true in the case of MAYV given its nonspecific febrile presentation and the uncertainty surrounding its true distribution and non-human animal reservoirs. Our model provides important information regarding regions of Central and South America that are at highest risk of MAYV transmission allowing us to estimate the total population living in areas suitable for MAYV transmission. Furthermore, we are able to identify areas with high predicted MAYV suitability despite low or moderate evidence consensus of known transmission.
Our model predicted the distribution of MAYV with relatively high accuracy, identifying several regions of high environmental suitability. This included large areas of North and Central Brazil (e.g., the states of Mato Grosso, Pará, and Goiás), French Guiana, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, and Northern Peru, all areas with well-documented evidence of MAYV transmission [70]. In addition, several regions with limited published evidence of MAYV transmission were also found to be highly suitable for transmission, including the majority of Guyana and Suriname. This finding highlights the utility of distribution models in identifying areas within countries that are particularly receptive to MAYV transmission that could be targeted for increased laboratory-based surveillance or vector control.
The wide predicted geographic distribution of MAYV underscores the need for increased surveillance and diagnostic capacity throughout Central and South America. Our findings suggest that MAYV may be underreported and that co-occurring arboviral epidemics (e.g., DENV or CHIKV) may obfuscate the true MAYV disease burden. This is especially true in Brazil, where ~43 million people reside in areas that are potentially suitable for MAYV transmission. An additional concern is the detection of MAYV in Haiti [71]. The discovery of MAYV in Haiti has prompted additional questions about its potential vectors and the possibility of urban transmission, due to the lack of Haemagogus (Hag.) janthinomys mosquitoes and non-human primates on the island. These questions require further entomological investigations in order to elucidate the vectorial capacity of urban mosquitoes and potential animal reservoirs other than non-human primates.
Another understudied aspect of the MAYV ecology is the impact of deforestation/land use change on transmission risk. This is an important consideration given the potential spread of MAYV in urban areas [13] and the demonstrated competence of Aedes mosquitoes in laboratory settings [14]. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated the link between residing or working in forested areas and MAYV risk [11, 12]. Environmental degradation and urbanization have led to increased contact between human populations and disease-carrying vectors, leading to elevated arbovirus transmission risk in general [72]. While this was not a specific focus of this study, we did account for the importance of land use/land cover in our analysis with the inclusion of EVI, evergreen forest, and urban land cover variables. While these variables contributed less to MAYV suitability model predictions compared to other climatic variables (e.g., rainfall), they still predicted MAYV transmission risk. Future studies of MAYV transmission risk could consider the specific impact of current and projected deforestation or land use change in order to predict future MAYV risk.
Our paper has several important limitations. First, there is significant heterogeneity of transmission within countries which may not be adequately captured by the evidence consensus scores. However, these country-level scores may help inform national-level approaches to surveillance and vector control, as well as help define transmission risks for international travel. In future work, evidence consensus scores may be generated for smaller geographic regions (e.g., first or second-level administrative divisions) as more data becomes available. Another limitation is related to the MAYV occurrence locations used as input data in the BRT environmental suitability model. Georeferenced reports of disease occurrence are subject to sampling bias related to the accessibility of certain locations, availability of laboratory infrastructure, or the presence of a robust surveillance system that is able to detect arbovirus occurrence. Therefore, the presence locations used in our model are likely subject to sampling bias and may not reflect the true distribution of MAYV. Following previously published modeling studies [62], we adjusted for the sampling bias in our dataset through the use of pseudoabsence points with a similar spatial bias as the presence points. However, the model may still be affected by sampling bias in the occurrence locations. Ideally, future MAYV distribution models will be updated when new occurrence locations are reported (as in Pigott et al. [73] updates to the Ebola suitability map), leading to a more accurate prediction of the true MAYV distribution.
Another limitation relates to the covariate set used to fit our model. Many aspects of the MAYV epidemiology remain poorly understood and current knowledge of MAYV ecology is limited. We included covariates that likely have a strong influence on MAYV transmission, including climate, landcover, and vegetation indices, which impact vector ecology and therefore transmission risk. However, MAYV transmission risk may be influenced by other unknown or understudied variables including socioeconomic factors and the presence of non-human reservoir hosts. Although several non-human primate species appear to be important MAYV reservoirs [9], we opted not to include primate distribution in our model due to uncertainty regarding their precise role in transmission cycles [27] in contrast to YFV [54]. As more research is conducted on MAYV ecology and additional animal reservoirs are identified, future MAYV distribution models should be updated to include primate distribution as a contributor to overall spillover risk. Our results here may assist in targeting and designing animal reservoir studies.
Conclusion
In this study, we produced a high-resolution map of predicted MAYV environmental suitability as well as evidence consensus scores of known transmission for countries in the Americas. Although there is still much to learn about MAYV ecology and epidemiology, these results may help inform national-level transmission risk awareness and guide tailored, local disease surveillance and vector control efforts. Furthermore, these evidence consensus scores and environmental suitability maps can be updated as new MAYV occurrence data is reported and with additional variables in the future as the role of other drivers of MAYV transmission are clarified.

We show that the mosquito Aedes aegypti, known for transmitting many viral pathogens to humans globally, and whose distribution is creeping northward in the USA toward regions where JCV is present, is likely able to transmit the virus. Wolbachia is an endosymbiotic bacterium being released in wild mosquito populations of because it limits the replication of human viruses inside the mosquito, limiting their transmission to humans. We show that Wolbachia has a limited ability to control the replication of JCV, which is likely because Wolbachia-induced antiviral response is quite weak, and unique aspects of negative-sense virus biology make them less susceptible to blocking. Our findings suggest that JCV may serve as a comparative model to positive-sense viruses like dengue in dissecting the mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated virus blocking. It also warns that shifting mosquito distributions, as expected under a changing climate, could bring JCV and Aedes mosquitoes into greater contact, potentially increasing the incidence of JCV in humans.",https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0011616,https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article/figure/image?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0011616.g004&size=inline,2023-09-05T14:00:00Z,"Abstract
Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV), a negative-sense arbovirus, is increasingly common in the upper Midwest of the USA. Transmitted by a range of mosquito genera, JCVs primary amplifying host is white-tailed deer. Aedes aegypti is responsible for transmitting various positive-sense viruses globally including dengue (DENV), Zika, chikungunya, and Yellow Fever. Ae. aegyptis distribution, once confined to the tropics, is expanding, in part due to climate change. Wolbachia, an insect endosymbiont, limits the replication of co-infecting viruses inside insects. The release and spread of the symbiont into Ae. aegypti populations have been effective in reducing transmission of DENV to humans, although the mechanism of Wolbachia-mediated viral blocking is still poorly understood. Here we explored JCV infection potential in Ae. aegypti, the nature of the vectors immune response, and interactions with Wolbachia infection. We show that Ae. aegypti is highly competent for JCV, which grows to high loads and rapidly reaches the saliva after an infectious blood meal. The mosquito immune system responds with strong induction of RNAi and JAK/STAT. Neither the direct effect of viral infection nor the energetic investment in immunity appears to affect mosquito longevity. Wolbachia infection blocked JCV only in the early stages of infection. Wolbachia-induced immunity was small compared to that of JCV, suggesting innate immune priming does not likely explain blocking. We propose two models to explain why Wolbachias blocking of negative-sense viruses like JCV may be less than that of positive-sense viruses, relating to the slowdown of host protein synthesis and the triggering of interferon-like factors like Vago. In conclusion, we highlight the risk for increased human disease with the predicted future overlap of Ae. aegypti and JCV ranges. We suggest that with moderate Wolbachia-mediated blocking and distinct biology, negative-sense viruses represent a fruitful comparator model to other viruses for understanding blocking mechanisms in mosquitoes.

Introduction
Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) is a negative-sense arbovirus in the genus Orthobunyavirus (family Peribunyaviridae), and a relative of La Crosse (LACV) and California Encephalitis viruses. JCV is part of an enzootic cycle involving White-tailed deer, as well as other ungulates, (reviewed in [1]). Transmitted between mammals by mosquitoes, JCV has been found in numerous species including at least 22 members [2] of the genera Aedes, Culex, Culiseta, Ochlerotatus, and Coquillettidia (reviewed in [3]). Currently, the upper Midwest of the USA, including the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin, has the highest incidence of human JCV [4]. Seroprevalence in humans in some communities has been found to be as high as 2040% [2]. Infection is usually asymptomatic but can induce fever, malaise, and headache [1]. Unlike most arboviral illnesses, JCV can also cause respiratory symptoms. In rare instances, the disease becomes neuroinvasive, with death occurring in &lt; 2% of cases [5]. JCV in humans has been on the rise over the last few decades, exhibiting a &gt; 9-fold increase in symptomatic cases. The increase may be explained by better detection and awareness [3,6] as well as factors known to drive enzootic disease spillovers like the destruction of habitat, human encroachment, and climate change [2].
Ae. aegypti, and to some extent its sister species Aedes albopictus, transmit some of the most prevalent arboviruses globally including dengue (DENV), Zika, chikungunya, and Yellow Fever [7]. The distribution of both vector species has expanded in recent decades, from tropical to subtropical and even to some temperate regions around the world [8,9]. By 2050, the more tropical Ae. aegypti is expected to occur consistently in the upper Midwest [8], where there are already sporadic reports during the summer months [4]. In addition, both case and seroprevalence data for JCV in humans and animals suggest the virus is present beyond the upper Midwest, including in the Western, Northeastern, and Southern regions of the USA [3]. To date, JCV has not been isolated from field-caught Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus and there have been no laboratory studies to test for vector competence.
Without deployable vaccines for many of the above viruses, vector control has been the primary means of limiting arboviral diseases in human populations. A recent and promising approach has involved the use of the insect bacterial endosymbiont, Wolbachia as a biocontrol agent [10]. Wolbachia infection in insects has the effect of limiting the ability of any co-infecting positive-sense viruses to replicate. This effect combined, with the vertically transmitted microbes ability to spread through populations has rendered it a powerful agent against virus transmission. Wolbachias release into Ae. aegypti populations in the field have conferred substantial reductions in dengue fever incidence in human populations living in the release zones in Malaysia, Brazil, and Indonesia [1113]. Since the discovery of Wolbachia-viral mediated blocking, its mechanistic basis has been highly sought after but remains incomplete. Understanding the basis of the blocking trait is a priority for the effective rollout of this agent across a diverse global landscape and into the future where virus [14] or mosquito [15] evolution may challenge the effectiveness of blocking. The current consensus is that the trait is likely multifaceted (reviewed in [16]), involving diverse aspects of insect physiology, part of which includes the insect immune response, triggered by the bacterial endosymbiont. Specific antiviral pathways and more generalist antioxidant responses [1719] are part of this innate immune priming response. Wolbachias ability to block positive-sense RNA viruses including DENV, Zika, chikungunya, and Yellow Fever has been well characterized [2022]. In contrast, blocking of the negative-sense viruses LACV, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and cell-fusing agent virus has only been tested in vitro, with little evidence of blocking [23,24]. With a poor understanding of whether blocking is mediated locally at the level of the cell, systemically [25,26], or both, vector competence experiments in the whole mosquito are needed for negative-sense viruses. Comparing the virus-blocking ability of Wolbachia with different types of viruses may offer a means to further dissect the blocking mechanism.
The innate immune landscape of a mosquito is shaped independently by Wolbachia and viral infections, and by their interactions during co-infection. The RNAi and the Toll pathways are considered the most important immune responses against positive-sense DENV in mosquitoes [27,28]. In Drosophila RNAi has also been shown to be critical for limiting negative-sense viruses [29]. In mosquitoes, the antiviral JAK-STAT pathway, activated by Vago protein [30][30], an interferon-like factor, is necessary for controlling DENV [31]. The activation of Vago through another pathway, IMD, is likely a means by which Wolbachia reduces loads of co-infecting positive-sense viruses [32,33]. Wolbachia infection triggers the expression of both Toll and IMD pathways by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in mosquitoes [17]. Interestingly, in mammals, interferons represent one of the key host defenses against infection with negative RNA viruses, like Rift Valley fever virus [34].
We carried out a vector competence study of JCV in wildtype and Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti to understand the potential emergence of this mosquito species as a vector, and to further explore the limits of Wolbachia-mediated blocking. We also examined the innate immune gene expression of Ae. aegypti in response to JCV, Wolbachia, and co-infection with both, to assess the reaction of the non-native vector to this new virus and the potential role of immunity in blocking negative-sense viruses.
Material and methods
Mosquito rearing
We used two mosquito lines in our experiments. A wildtype, Wolbachia-free line derived from a lab-established colony of wildtype mosquitoes collected ~5 years prior in Mérida, Mexico. The second line consisted of a laboratory colony of Ae. aegypti infected with the wAlbB strain of Wolbachia [35] that was backcrossed into the Mérida line. All mosquitoes were maintained in a climate-controlled insectary, at 26 ± 1°C and 68 ± 5% relative humidity, with a 12:12 hour light: dark cycle. Larvae were reared in plastic trays (40 × 30 × 8cm) containing deionized (DI) water at a density of 300 larvae/3L of water and fed with one tablet of Tropical Fish Food (Tetramin: Tetra Werke, W. Germany) every two days. Adult mosquitoes received 10% sucrose solution ad libitum, and females were blood-fed weekly with human blood from anonymous donors (BioIVT: Westbury, NY) using a Hemotek membrane feeder (Hemotek Ltd., UK) when eggs were required for experimental or colony rearing purposes.
Infection of mosquitoes with Jamestown Canyon virus
Vero cells were cultured at 37°C (5% CO2) with Dulbeccos Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS (Fetal bovine serum) and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Pen-Strep). The Jamestown Canyon virus (strain CT 15-8-72591 passage history = Vero 2) was obtained from the UTMB Arbovirus Reference collection. When cells reached 80% confluency, the medium was removed and replaced with new media containing 2% FBS. Cell culture supernatants were collected 3 days post-infection, and the number of virus gene copy numbers was determined through RT-qPCR. Virus-infected cell supernatant was then re-suspended 1:1 in fresh whole human blood and used in an infectious blood meal. 6 ± 1 day-old adult mosquitoes were immobilized on ice and females were spread into 2 L paper containers (Zoro, Cat. no. G4215843) and were starved for ~18 hours before feeding. Females were fed on the blood-virus mixtures or blood-mock mixtures (1: 1) for 40 minutes using the Hemotek membrane feeder system to keep the blood warm at 37°C. After feeding, females were immobilized on ice the second time, and engorged females were sorted into 16 oz paper containers (Zoro, Cat. no. G4141713) and provided with 10% sucrose solution ad libitum through a mesh lid.
At 0 dpi, whole females from both the Wolbachia infected or uninfected lines were collected in 2 mL micro tubes containing a ceramic bead and 300 L of TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. no. T9424). These individuals were then used to assess initial viral load post-feeding (S1 Table), with individuals averaging ~106 viral copies per individual. The remaining fully engorged females were separated into containers for collection at 3, 7, 10, and 14 days post-infection (dpi). In the first replicate, at each time point we collected samples of females from four tissues: wings + legs, saliva, abdomen and head + thorax. The saliva samples were first collected using a previously established capillary method [21]. All samples were stored in 300L of TRI Reagent, kept at -80°C until further processing. In the second independent replicate, we only tested abdomen and head + thorax. Infection rates (virus prevalence) in the abdomen were explored to capture early infection events, including virus in the midgut tissue, whereas head/thorax measures served as proxies for dissemination. Legs and saliva measurements are used to indicate the potential transmissibility of virus and the result from legs might be more accurate [36]. Viral loads (viral copy numbers) were measured to quantify strength of infection.
Jamestown Canyon virus quantification
For nucleic acid extraction, samples were homogenized as previously described [37] using a Bead Ruptor Elite (Omni International, Kennesaw, GA). Trizol (Invitrogen) extraction of total RNA from individual whole mosquitoes was performed following manufacturers instructions, resuspended in nuclease-free water, and quantified using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer system (ThermoFisher Scientific). Each RNA sample was then diluted to 20 ng/L in 20 L nuclease-free water and stored at -80°C. JCV levels per tissue were quantified by RT-qPCR using a LightCycler 480 instrument (Roche). The primer set was designed by Kinsella et al [5] and quantified by SYBR Green assay (S1 Text).

After infectious blood feeding, whole-body Wolbachia positive and negative females were collected at 3, 7, 10 and 14 dpi, stored in 300L of TRI Reagent, kept at -80°C for confirmation of their total body virus loads DNA and RNA were extracted from all samples collected above using a Direct-zol DNA/RNA Miniprep kit (Zymo Research, Cat No. R2080), and RNA was used for gene expression, while DNA was used for Wolbachia quantification followed the methods described previously [1]. Relative Wolbachia density was based on a 2-Ct method using mosquito (RPS17 forward: 5-TCCGTGGTATCTCCATCAAGCT-3, reverse: 5-CACTTCCGGCACGTAGTTGTC-3) [15] and Wolbachia Walb (gene WD0513) [38] forward: 5-CCTTACCTCCTGCACAACAA-3, reverse: 5-GGATTGTCCAGTGGCCTTA -3) primer sets that described previously. The qRT-PCR cycle was activated at 95°C for 30 seconds (Ramp Rate: 4.4°C/s), followed by 40 amplification cycles and melting curve analysis same as the viral quantification assays described (S1 Text).
To test the immune response of female Wolbachia positive and negative Ae. aegypti after Jamestown Canyon virus infection, we selected four genes: MYD88, IMD, hopscotch and AGO2 to represent the immune response from the Toll pathway [17], IMD pathway [17], JAK/STAT pathway [31,39], and RNAi pathway [40] respectively (Table 1). In addition, we also tested the expression level of AeVago1, which encodes Vago protein, an interferon-like factor. The qPCR was run under the same conditions as above for virus quantification. We used gene rps17 to normalize expression levels through the 2-Ct method [41]. Primers used are listed in S2 Table.
Female longevity
The longevity of Aedes aegypti females was tested under the infection of Wolbachia and/or JCV virus (that fed with JCV or its mock media). After feeding, engorged females were immobilized on the ice and isolated in groups of 1415 females in 16 oz containers. Each line was represented by eight to eleven cups. Mosquitoes were fed through mesh lids using 2 cotton balls, one soaked in 10% sucrose and another with only water, that were changed every 2 days. Female survival was checked every two days from 4 to 66 days post-infectious feeding.
Statistical analysis
We used R v. 4.2.1 to conduct data analyses and visualizations. For virus quantification and dissemination, we used a generalized linear model to test the infection prevalence in different tissues and a generalized additive model to test the viral load after JCV infectious blood feeding. The relative gene expression and Wolbachia density data were log 10 transformed for ANOVA analysis. Longevity data was compared using the Log-Rank survival test. We also carried out pair-wise comparisons between Wolbachia infected and uninfected strains using Mann-Whitney-U-Test (for viral load), Chi-squared test (for infection prevalence) or Tukeys HSD test (gene expression).

Vector competence for Jamestown Canyon virus
We infected mosquito lines with and without Wolbachia infection with Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) by oral feeding and then studied viral prevalence and viral load across key tissues (abdomen, head &amp; thorax) at several days post-infection (dpi). The Wolbachia-free (wildtype line) showed very strong viral prevalence in mosquito tissues in both replicate experiments, with rates &gt;90% by three dpi (Figs 1A and S1A), in both the abdomen and head &amp; thorax, indicating dissemination of virus. Viral loads averaged across all dpi and both replicate experiments were high; 5.25 × 107 copies/tissue in abdomen and 8.39 × 107 copies/tissue in the head &amp; thorax (Fig 1B). Viral loads were also highly bimodal, a common feature of viral loads in mosquitoes [43]. Virus prevalence in legs and saliva (Fig 2A) were near 100% across all dpi, and above 50% after dpi 7, respectively. Saliva estimates of viral prevalence are a conservative estimate of transmissibility [36]. Average viral loads in the legs and saliva (Fig 2B) were 6.84 × 107 and 1.00 × 104 copies/tissue, respectively. These data strongly demonstrate that, Ae. aegypti is highly competent for JCV, allowing rapid virus dissemination through the mosquito body and excretion into the saliva.

The effect of Wolbachia infection on JCV prevalence (Figs 1A and S1A) varied by tissue but was consistent across two replicate experiments (replicates: z = -1.29, p = 0.20; Wolbachia infection: z = -5.65, p &lt; 0.001; dpi: z = 5.68, p &lt; 0.001, tissue: z = 1.79, p = 0.074). There was no effect of Wolbachia infection in abdomen (z = -1.14, p = 0.25), nor an effect of dpi (z = -0.09, p = 0.93). There was, however, a significant interaction (z = 4.11, p &lt; 0.001), whereby Wolbachia reduced prevalence at dpi 3 and 14 in replicate one (Fig 1A) and dpi 3 (S1A Fig) in replicate two. For head &amp; thorax, Wolbachia infection (z = -3.32, p &lt; 0.001), dpi (z = 2.99, p = 0.003), and the interaction (z = 3.19, p = 0.001) were all significant. Like in abdomen, Wolbachia infection showed the greatest ability to reduce the prevalence of JCV at 3 and 14 dpi (Fig 1A) in replicate one, and 3 dpi in replicate two (S1A Fig). When Wolbachia infection was associated with reduced prevalence, reductions ranged from 2050%.
The effect of Wolbachia on viral load (Figs 1B and S1B) varied across the two replicate experiments (replicate: t = 4.49, p &lt; 0.001; Wolbachia infection: t = -0.48, p = 0.63; dpi: t = 1.74, p = 0.082, tissue: t = 3.83, p &lt; 0.001). We, therefore, analyzed the replicates separately. For replicate one (Fig 1B), Wolbachia had no effect in the abdomen (t = -0.68, p = 0.49), nor dpi (t = - 0.67, p = 0.51), but had a significant interaction (t = 4.80, p &lt; 0.001). Specifically, Wolbachia led to decreased loads in JCV at dpi 14 in replicate 1 and day 3 in replicate 2 (S3 Table). For head &amp; thorax, Wolbachia infection (t = -2.34, p = 0.020), dpi (t = 3.04, p = 0.002) and the interaction (t = 2.57, p = 0.011) were all significant. Wolbachia infection reduced viral loads on average by a factor of 0.68 across all time points in the head &amp; thorax, with the greatest effect at day 3. In contrast, for replicate two (S1B Fig), in either tissue Wolbachia (abdomen: t = 0.22, p = 0.82; head &amp; thorax: t = 1.94, p = 0.053) or dpi (abdomen: t = 1.84, p = 0.066; head &amp; thorax: t = - 0.97, p = 0.33) had no effect on viral load, but a significant interaction was found for head &amp; thorax but not for abdomen (abdomen: t = 0.22, p = 0.83; head &amp; thorax: t = 2.67, p = 0.008). Like replicate 1, the greatest reduction in JCV in association with Wolbachia infection was at dpi 3 (S3 Table). In summary, the ability for Wolbachia to control JCV is most pronounced both early and late during infection. This may suggest an ability to both delay early replication as well as speed clearance.
Saliva and legs were tested in addition to measure JCV dissemination efficiency, an approximation of viral transmissibility. The prevalence of virus in saliva was affected by Wolbachia infection (z = -3.66, p &lt; 0.001) and dpi (z = 3.57, p &lt; 0.001), and with a significant interaction (z = - 2.36, p = 0.018). Wolbachia infection was more likely to reduce viral load in the early time points (Fig 2A). In legs there was no effect of Wolbachia infection (z = - 0.01, p = 0.995) or dpi (z = - 0.78, p = 0.43). For viral load in saliva (Fig 2B), there was no effect of dpi (t = - 1.03, p = 0.31) or Wolbachia infection (t = - 0.69, p = 0.49). Viral load in legs (Fig 2B) was significant for both dpi (t = - 3.64, p &lt; 0.05) and Wolbachia infection (t = 6.07, p &lt; 0.05). On average, across all time points, Wolbachia infection only reduced infection prevalence by 0.23% in saliva. Viral load in saliva was reduced by ~50% on average (Wolbachia: 5.06×103 copies/tissue; uninfected: 9.62×103 copies/tissue) but unexpectedly increased it by ~9.5 times on average in legs (Wolbachia: 3.28×107 copies/tissue; uninfected: 4.72×106 copies/tissue).
Effect of Jamestown Canyon virus infection on immune gene expression
We selected five mosquito immune genes whose expression has been shown to control virus infections and/or be responsive to Wolbachia infection. We then tested their relative expression levels in Wolbachia wAlbB infected and uninfected lines, with and without JCV infection at different dpi (Fig 3). Mosquito samples from the same line fed with mock-infected blood served as controls. Although the response of these pathways varied significantly by dpi, our results showed that the RNAi pathway (represented by gene AGO) was the major responder to JCV infection, as well as Vago (encodes an interferon-like factor), with expression levels increasing ~1000-fold at 10 dpi in both lines. We also found that the JAK/STAT pathway (represented by hop) demonstrated a 100-fold increase in expression at 14 dpi in the Wildtype (Wolbachia-free) line. AGO, Vago, and hop showed rising trends with increasing dpi (Fig 3). MYD88 and IMD which represent Toll and IMD pathways, respectively, exhibited very little expression level change (&lt; 10-fold) in response to JCV infection. When each gene was considered separately, we found all genes showed significant differences at different dpi (MYD88: F3,247 = 41.71, p &lt; 0.001; IMD: F3,247 = 23.20, p &lt; 0.001; hop: F3,247 = 9.24, p &lt; 0.001; AGO: F3,247 = 77.45, p &lt; 0.001; Vago: F3,247 = 78.57, p &lt; 0.001). Specifically, hop (F3,247 = 28.24, p = 0.018), AGO (F3,247 = 4.97, p = 0.027), and Vago (F3,247 = 16.02, p &lt; 0.001) showed higher expression in the wildtype versus Wolbachia-infected lines. Wolbachia had no effect on the expression of gene MYD88 (F3,247 = 1.203, p = 0.274) and IMD (F3,247 = 1.589, p = 0.209) after mosquito infection with JCV. In general, the impact of Wolbachia on mosquito immune gene expression was smaller in comparison to JCV (S2 Fig and S4 Table), reducing the expression of the JAK/STAT pathway and increasing the expression of the IMD pathway up to 5-fold dpi.

Effect of Jamestown Canyon virus infection on Wolbachia density and female longevity
We quantified the relative density of Wolbachia for the whole body of wAlbB-infected mosquitoes at different days post-feeding with JCV-infected or mock-infected blood (S3 Fig). We found there was no effect of JCV infection (F1,120 = 3.78, p = 0.054), a slight effect of dpi (F3,120 = 2.78, p = 0.044), and no interaction (F3,120 = 2.35, p = 0.08). Wolbachia significantly reduced survival (Fig 4) by pair-wise log-rank tests whether females had been fed with JCV (2 = 14.5, df = 1, p &lt; 0.001) or mock (2 = 15.3, df = 1, p &lt; 0.001). JCV infection had no effect on female survival for either Wolbachia infected (2 = 0.4, df = 1, p = 0.52) and uninfected (2 &lt; 0.1, df = 1, p = 0.89) lines.
Discussion
In this study, we tested the vector competence of Ae. aegypti for Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) and investigated whether there is Wolbachia-mediated blocking against this negative-sense RNA virus. We demonstrated Ae. aegyptis potential to be a highly competent vector given the following: 1) the infection prevalence and viral loads were very high, near 100% and 107 viral copies/tissue, respectively, and 2), the virus disseminated rapidly, showing dissemination and presence in the saliva at only 3 days post-infectious feed. Additionally, the virus did not reduce female mosquito longevity, leaving this aspect of vectorial capacity unaffected, and lifetime transmission potential high. In terms of the impact of Wolbachia, we found that Wolbachia only had a moderate ability to inhibit JCV, reducing virus prevalence and viral loads, largely very early during infection.
The emergence and spread of infectious diseases of zoonotic origin have become crucial issues in global human health in recent decades [44,45]. Our study shows that JCV, now circulating primarily in the upper Midwest [1,3] has the potential to become a much larger public health threat if its distribution collides with the expanding ranges of Ae. aegypti [8] and likely, its close relative, Ae. albopictus. Most of the current vectors of JCV are likely feeding on both humans and animals [2], directly facilitating human spillover infections. Ae. aegypti, in contrast, feeds with near-perfect fidelity on humans [46]. Its presence in the region would therefore not facilitate spillover but could drive a direct human-human transmission cycle if the virus were sufficiently common. Ae. albopictus, in contrast, is more flexible in its host range, depending on availability. It can feed exclusively on humans [46] or other mammals including deer [47] and hence could be a potential participant in both an enzootic and anthroponotic cycle. Interestingly, Ae. albopictus naturally harbors Wolbachia infection [35]. Our work suggests the symbiont may do little to limit the vector competence of wild Ae. albopictus for JCV if the virus establishes itself in an individual mosquito. JCV loads in the body of Wolbachia-infected Ae. aegypti were very high (averaging 107 viral copies/disseminated tissues), following a starting total load of 106 viral copies/midgut. These values are on the higher end of what is seen for similarly designed studies with DENV in Ae. aegypti, which is a natural vector (reviewed in [48]). Little is known about the range of JCV titers in the blood of infected humans or wild mammals. For the closely related LACV, titers resulting from artificial infections in deer, and other mammals ranged from 102 to 105/ml [49, 50]. Even if titers are low in human and wild hosts, Ae. aegypti is very effective at amplifying and disseminating JCV.
Ae. aegypti mounted a very strong immune response to JCV that peaked at 10 dpi, but with infection prevalence and viral loads continuing to remain high. This may suggest poor efficacy of the response, or more likely, a steady state between virus replication and anti-viral immune action. In the case of DENV infection where kinetics has been more closely examined, viral loads also plateau and remain high and constant [43] despite a well-described anti-DENV response [51]. The immune response largely consisted of the RNAi and JAK/STAT pathways. While negative-sense viruses do not make dsRNAs in sufficient quantities to trigger RNAi [52], regardless, this pathway has been shown in Drosophila [53] and in mosquitoes [54] to both respond to and limit negative-sense viruses. The parallel expression patterns of AGO and Vago in response to infection are likely due to molecular crosstalk. Vago, produced by the IMD pathway or Wolbachia infection, encodes an interferon-like factor that is also a mediator of both the JAK/STAT [33] and RNAi pathways [55]. Last, JCV infection did not appear to shorten mosquito lifespan, suggesting the virus is not cytotoxic in this novel host and that there are not extreme fitness tradeoffs for mounting the strong immune response seen here (reviewed in [56]). This is perhaps not surprising as LACV in its native vector Aedes triseriatus [57] has no discernable effect on fitness and the virus can live for very long periods in the mosquito, including in the ovaries. The latter is associated with transovarial transmission and overwintering of the virus in northern climates.
Wolbachia-mediated blocking is known to be a multifaceted blocking trait [16], whose composition may vary depending on the Wolbachia strain, virus species/genotype, and vector species/genotype. One interesting feature of our findings is that virus prevalence and load appear to be disconnected, as if two independent traits. In contrast, for dengue virus, low prevalence and low viral loads together are characteristic of Wolbachia-mediated blocking [58][58]. With JCV, Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes appear better at preventing infection, rather than controlling it, once initiated. This may suggest early events are of most importance for Wolbachia-mediated blocking of negative strand viruses. Previous studies have suggested that viral RNA early in infection is the primary target for blocking [59], possibly recognized by the immune system [17, 60], but that Wolbachia-induced changes in mosquito physiology involving lipid trafficking [61][61], autophagy [61,62], and reactive oxygen species [17], etc can also play a role. Dissecting the relative contributions of these multiple components has been challenging in a tripartite organismal system, with no ability to genetically modify Wolbachia and difficulties in modifying DENV. The presence of Wolbachia-mediated blocking of JCV in both tissues and saliva early in infection offers new comparative potential for dissecting blocking mechanisms relative to positive-sense viruses. The innate immune pathways including RNAi [19], IMD (including Vago), and Toll are involved with Wolbachia-mediated blocking of positive-sense viruses [18]. Relative to JCV infection, however, Wolbachia only moderately induced immune gene expression. Furthermore, during co-infection, Wolbachia appeared also to dampen the immune induction by JCV at some time points (see AGO, vago, and hop, as well as MYD88 and IMD at 3 dpi) suggesting immune activation is unlikely to be at play here. The strength of these interpretations is, however, somewhat limited by the sample sizes for the gene expression.
We propose a hypothetical model for why Wolbachia-mediated blocking may be less able to control JCV than positive-sense viruses. LACV is known to cause a dramatic shut-off of host protein synthesis in BHK cells, and then subsequently, viral protein synthesis in the later stages of infection [63]. This strategy is thought to protect viruses from attack by host antiviral factors. Mosquito cells infected with LACV continue to divide and behave normally despite infection and so appear unaffected. Wolbachia infection has a related effect on host protein synthesis, reducing it by 23% in Drosophila JW18 cells [64], but not shutting it off as per LACV. Positive-sense viruses, without an mRNA intermediate, would be dependent on host polymerase and their replication activity would slow. Negative-sense viruses, utilize their own polymerase to produce mRNA copies of their genomes. Because the activity level of this polymerase is highest when low amounts of viral protein are present, Wolbachia induced reductions in protein synthesis should instead lead to the overproduction of JCV mRNAs. Second, other members of the Peribunyaviridae, in mammalian cells, have been shown to remove the 5 terminus of their genome post-transcriptionally to prevent detection by receptors that trigger interferon activity [65]. There may be parallel stealth activities in the vector to avoid triggering the action of the interferon-like factor Vago [66]. This is difficult to assess, however, with many aspects of the insect antiviral pathways still undefined including key receptors, and modes of action. When examining Wolbachia infection alone (S2 Fig), the strongest immune activation was for Vago early during infection. The impact of Wolbachias activation of Vago may be greater for DENV and other positive sense viruses where viral infection induction of the gene is much less strong than for JCV [32]. There are alternate explanations, including because of low JCV levels early in infection, there are insufficient PAMPs to trigger antiviral pathways, or that JAK/STAT may be necessary, but insufficient to control viruses as has been shown previously [67]. We finish by saying that studying the Wolbachia-mediated blocking seen here early during infection may reveal the functional importance of more universal aspects of blocking not specific to virus type.
In summary, we show that Ae. aegypti has the potential to be a very effective vector of JCV in the future, with the mosquitos range shifting northward [8], and JCV being present beyond the Midwest. Future studies should explore the vector competence of Ae. albopictus for JCV, which given its more temperate range, may be a more imminent threat. Additionally, characterizing JCV titers in wild mammals and humans may help to provide context for the vector competence seen here. We also show some evidence of Wolbachia-mediated blocking of a negative-sense virus inside the mosquito, whereas previous in vitro studies with other viruses found no evidence of blocking [23,24]. Evidence of weak blocking suggests that JCV may serve as a good comparator for teasing out both aspects of blocking that may vary by virus sense-specific biology and indeed those that are more universal. We propose two hypothetical scenarios that may be explored experimentally in vitro and in vivo. This work should revive interest in studying negative-sense viruses in mosquitoes as a model for Wolbachia-mediated blocking. One specific comparative study that may be of value would be to assess the expression of downstream genes induced by Vago in response to negative versus positive sense viruses.

Introduction
In 2015, the United Nations (UN) adopted a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including goals to address poverty, hunger, health, employment, the environment, and energy [1]. The SDGs emphasize the organizational operationalization and integration of sustainability and, therefore, address the current and forthcoming stakeholder needs. Hence, ensuring a better and sustainable future for all, balancing the economic, social, and environmental development [2]. Science, technology, and innovation (STI) are critical to achieving most SDGs, but successfully delivering STI solutions depends on overcoming longstanding challenges. Given the urgent need to address sustainability challenges within SDGs, new STI policies are required to tackle climate change, strengthen food systems, boost economic resilience, and sustain long-term growth, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Contributing to the effective formulation and implementation of STI is critical in this respect. A substantial body of literature exists linking STIs critical role in societys prosperity and well-being [37]. The importance of accelerating STI delivery to achieve SDGs has been highlighted by policymakers and in the literature as a crucial issue in the wake of the economic, health, and social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic [8,9].
Over the years, STI policies, which are one of the critical elements for the implementation of the sustainable development agenda, have become more complex partly due to diverse factors that intervene in the process [7,10,11]. The dynamics of multi-stakeholder partnerships for implementing STI policies at the global level raise fundamental issues around the innovation system and its approach in national and regional governments. As a result, it reinforces the need to recognize the network of organizations, actors, and individuals and the rules for introducing, disseminating, and exploiting existing or new technology and knowledge [12,13]. This raises concerns about how various actors and institutions can work together to promote the acquisition and diffusion of innovation systems in terms of knowledge and ideas that will help determine the direction, scale, and successful implementation of SDGs. For example, private sector, consumers, academia, national governments and multi-lateral institutions as well as standards, regulations and, practices across different regions shape global debate on STI cooperation for the achievement of SDGs. In this regard, the range and diversity of global efforts to formulate and manage STI policies to achieve SDGs becomes apparent through the assessment of some of principal interests, obstacles, areas of confrontation, and cooperation [7,10,14].
The UN has called for global integration of SDGs into STI to enhance economic growth and prosperity around the world [15]. Addressing part of the challenges in SDGs requires effective implementation of an STI system in low-and middle-income countries. Evidence shows that the wealthiest countries dominating global research and development have strengthened their economies and suited their production and consumption patterns for several decades rather than meeting global social needs [16,17]. This is reflected in massive research and development investments that have shaped global agriculture, pharmaceutical, transport, energy, infrastructure, and other economic sectors. Technology has revolutionized how these industries conduct their businesses and enabled businesses to foster product development, diversification, and market penetration. Indeed, technology ownership dominated by high-income countries has raised many questions about whether low-and-middle-income countries are paying enough attention to technology development underpinned by science and innovation to promote economic growth and solve social problems. The dominance of a few companies in a global market is partly due to their ability to harness science and innovation to develop new technology. This is particularly true as technologies that could benefit social development are frequently held by the private sector in high-income countries. For example, the private sector accounts for more than 66% of global research and development spending, primarily targeted toward narrow goals and business interests in high-income countries [18]. The fact that the private sector controls intellectual property rights makes access to technologies for social benefits a daunting task [19]. Limited access to technology has been argued to be one of the key reasons for inequality between high, low-and-middle income countries [20]. It also presents a significant challenge to the achievement of SDGs. In light of this challenge, technology and the combination of STIs can play an important role in the achievement of the SDGs. However, how STI is prioritized in national innovation systems to achieve the SDGs, especially in low-and-middle-income countries, remains unclear. In this regard, the inclusiveness of technology-enabled solutions is critical to addressing agenda 2030 particularly, global production, consumption, food insecurity, poverty and climate change [15,21].
Evidence suggests limited participation of the global south scientific community in formulating SDGs. This has been attributed to a widening gap of science and research between high and low-and-middle-income countries. For example, in 2014, the OECD countries accounted for more than 3500 researchers per million inhabitants when compared to 70 per million inhabitants in high income countries [18]. African countries remain at the bottom of the table with only 2.6% contribution of total scientific publications in 2014. This shortcoming prevents them from active engagement at the international level due to lack of knowledge-based and context-specific transformation pathways. Moreover, inadequate investment in research and development might have not only contributed to limited engagement in formulation of the SDGs and the ability of low-income countries to realize SDGs. Yet, the UN system continues to call for the increased participation of low-and middle-income countries to ensure successful implementation of SDGs.
An international interdisciplinary team has identified critical elements of national and international policies and strategies to deliver SDG STI solutions. The aim was to create a framework that fosters a systemic approach to planning and undertaking the required actions to facilitate the work of national governments and international development agencies globally. To the best of our knowledge and reach, only a few studies have explored interdisciplinary STI in the context of achieving SDGs and have directly addressed research questions around: 1) the integration of SDGs into STI cooperation; 2) the need for increasing levels of participation by the global South scientific community in the implementation of SDGs; and 3) STI-based solutions relevant to the achievement of the SDGs.
To this end, we assessed the perspectives of relevant stakeholder groups (i.e., policymakers, academia, donor, private sector and non-governmental organizations) through an international survey (see methods) on the role of STI in tackling SDG challenges in three main themes: 1) agriculture (SDG1 and SDG2no poverty and zero hunger), 2) health (SDG3ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for everyone of all ages), and 3) environment and energy (SDG7ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy, and SDG13take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts).
Method
Objectives and Research Design
This study examines the role of Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) and the factors that facilitate and/or hinder the effective implementation of SDGs, especially in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). According to the World Banks fiscal year 2024 classification, LMICs have a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita between $1,136 and $4,465 [22]. These countries are generally in a transitional phase, experiencing some economic development and improvement in living standards.
To achieve the study objectives, a two-stage approach was applied: (1) a survey with stakeholders and (2) the development of a framework.
<ol><li>(1) Survey with stakeholders</li></ol>
Questionnaire development and measurement scales
First, based on meetings, experience-sharing of the authors as ad hoc experts in the field, related reports [23,24], and literature review [2527], a questionnaire was developed to capture the main obstacles, challenges, solutions, and reinforcing or conflicting mechanisms on how STI can be applied to achieve SDGs. The 2030 Agenda highlights the integrated nature and indivisibility of the 17 sustainable development goals; yet acknowledges that different countries set their priorities according to their national context. Hence, SDG1 (no poverty), SDG2 (zero hunger), SDG3 (health and well-being), SDG7 (energy), and SDG13 (climate change) were selected in this study, considering their shared relevance and the positive impacts STI can bring to their implementation in LMIC (UN Note SDGs VNRs) [28]. Furthermore, previous research highlights that connections between the SDGs must be identified and tackled, increasing the need for partnerships and effective collaboration between different stakeholder groups, as SDG17 aims for [2]. Moreover, SDGs were centered on three main themes: 1) agriculture (SDG1 and SDG2- no poverty and zero hunger), 2) health (SDG3ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages), and 3) environment (SDG7ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy and SDG13take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts). These themes were recently suggested in a book that covers many pressing problems and current opportunities, emphasizing the role of STIs in developing countries. The book was edited by researchers from the team of authors and compiled 26 chapters written by 71 authors from 18 countries (Adenle et al., 2020) [25].
The questionnaire was developed in English and structured in the following sections: i) socio-demographic information of the respondents; ii) obstacles in the application of STI and challenges in the STI cooperation between low-middle and high-income countries; iii) solutions to achieve SDGs 1, 2, 3 (including COVID-19 recovery), 7 and 13; and finally, iv) reinforcing/conflicting interactions between STI interventions and the achievement of SDGs (e.g., cheap energy can increase the access to basic services, but also for additional demand, generating negative environmental impacts).
It is important to determine respondents perceptions on the obstacles, challenges, and solutions of STI given the relevance to the SDGs. Researchers have used a similar approach to explore the link between obstacles/challenges and solutions to gain insights into the implementation of new policies [26,27]. To assess the responses, 5-point Likert scales (Importance) were applied, ranging from (1 = Unimportant, 2 = Of little importance, 3 = Moderately important, 4 = Important, and 5 = Very important); the mean values of each scale item are presented in the results. The internal consistency of the scales was measured with Cronbachs Alpha [29]. Cronbachs alpha tests to see if the multiple-question Likert scale surveys are reliable. It is a measure of internal consistency, i.e., how closely related a set of items are as a group. It is a function of the number of test items and the inter-correlation among the items. In this study, the scales measuring Obstacles (0.825); Challenges (0.777); Solutions for SDG1 (no poverty) and SDG2 (zero hunger) (0.819); Solutions for SDG3 and COVID-19 recovery (0.804); and Solutions for SDG7 (energy) and 13 (climate change) (0.819) obtained satisfactory reliability values (&gt;0.7) as described by Hair and his group [30,31].
Sampling and data collection
The online survey was conducted between July 2021 and February 2022, and a stakeholder-based survey approach [26] was used. This means that information from a broad range of stakeholder groups (including academic researchers, policymakers, donors, agents of the private sector, and non-governmental organizations) around the world was collected. It is assumed that those multiple actors who are actively involved in the STI and SDG debates are also well-informed and aware of the challenges LMICs face. Moreover, it is possible to go beyond simple questions designed for citizens who do not feel familiar with the issue. Finally, analyzing stakeholders perceptions can lead to strategic decisions in the public and private spheres to support STI and the successful implementation of SDGs in LMICs.
Survey invitations were distributed to the professional networks of the interdisciplinary study team via e-mail and relevant social media websites (Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn). These social media networking sites also extended generic invitations, personal invitations, and group invitations. All invitations specifically included the request to share and further distribute the invitation with additional professional networks. The snowball method was used to reach more targeted respondents [32].
Online surveys commonly face selection and respondent bias where the population to which they are distributed cannot be described, and respondents with biases may select themselves into the sample [33]. To mitigate the challenges, surveys were targeted through professional networks. The invitations consisted of a brief outline of the study and who was required and had the profile to complete it. The online questionnaire was anonymous, following the ethical approval guidelines, and did not ask for personally-identifiable information. The research team acknowledges that sampling bias does not allow the statistical generalization of the results. Yet, through convenience and purposive sampling, findings relevant to a sub-population of interest (in our case, experts and stakeholders with knowledge of STI and SDGs) could be identified.
In total, 199 responses were collected from questionnaires distributed around the world. The survey was programmed to require the respondents consent to participate in the survey and only forms that included answers for all the required questions could be finalized and submitted to the server. It is estimated that the survey reached out to more than 1,000 academic researchers and more than 500 different stakeholder groups including the private sector, NGOs and donors. This represents a response rate of approximately 13% which is considered acceptable for surveys online [34]. To reduce the response bias (i.e., situations where people do not answer questions truthfully for some reason), the study followed best practice recommendations (e.g., the survey was short and to the point to avoid respondent fatigue, the language was unambiguous and the questions were interesting and relevant to the respondents, keeping them engaged). To reduce non-response bias (i.e., when those unwilling or unable to take part in a research study are different from those who do), the team reinforced the contacts with key stakeholders and kept the data collection flexible (via emails and social media, snowball sampling), but focused on the target group [35]. It is important to acknowledge that STIs can facilitate the achievement of SDGs in different countries, but the challenges and obstacles are higher for LMICs. For that reason, the survey was distributed in a systemic way to the target sample, (i.e., irrespective of the country of origin of the stakeholders). Future research might explore the perception of stakeholders located in LMICs or High Income Countries, for example, since results could provide different perspectives and segmented strategies for the achievement of the SDGs.
The final sample was composed of 199 participants (52.8% male and 47.2 female, 81.4% postgraduate, 40.7% ranging from 3649 years old) belonging to relevant stakeholder groups (e.g., academia (42.2%), international (13.6%) and non-governmental organizations (18.6%), policymakers (15.1%), donors (1%)).
<ol><li>(2) Framework Development</li></ol>The second methodological approach is based on the assumption that the SDG framework lacks a holistic approach that recognizes the interconnectedness among its goals and targets. Indeed, progress toward one goal could either impede or enhance progress towards other goals, as described by previous studies [61,62]. To address the challenges and complexities of integrating Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) into SDG achievement, a comprehensive framework is proposed, focusing on four key dimensions: i) national planning; ii) resource and capacity building; iii) engagement and partnerships, and iv) access. These dimensions are substantiated by the literature [6365] and by the viewpoints of the authors. Data from the stakeholders survey (as described beforehand) encompassing a broad spectrum of STI-related issues are crucial for attaining the SDGs and advancing towards an overall sustainable development agenda, all of which complements the framework development. The framework will be presented in detail in the next section.
Ethics approval
Ethics approval (2021-IRB16) was granted by the Institutional Review Board of the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT). For inclusion in the study, respondents were required to complete three levels of voluntary consent: (i) the participant agreeing to participate after reading the purpose and nature of the study, (ii) the participant granting permission for the responses to be used in research publications; and (iii) the participant granting permission for the research to use direct or attributed quotations from the interview.
Results
Factors hindering STI applications in low- and middle-income countries
Two sets of questions were applied to better understand the factors hindering STI applications in low- and middle-income countries.
First, survey respondents were asked to rate the importance of obstacles (Fig 1A) in applying STI in achieving SDGs. As described in Fig 1A, seven obstacles were considered to be very important. Nevertheless, poor infrastructure (including agriculture and food distribution, and health systems) was considered the most important obstacle in applying STI to achieve SDGs, followed by constraints and limitations related to cooperation of the global scientific community.

Next, respondents were asked to indicate the degree of importance of different factors to overcome some of the challenges while stimulating the cooperation between high-income and low- and middle-income countries in providing STI solutions for SDGs (Fig 1A). They indicated that limited participation of the global south scientific community, limited public-private partnerships, lack of interdisciplinary, absence of indigenous knowledge in the formulation of SDGs, and absence of frugal innovation for the basis of the pyramid, as hurdles for the application of STI in LMICs. These instances demonstrate the increasing need to integrate the global scientific communitys perspectives into the decision-making process for cooperative STI policy [7].
To overcome these barriers and stimulate cooperation between high-income and low- and middle-income countries in providing STI solutions for SDGs, respondents indicated education and human capital as the most important factors followed by policies and governance, infrastructure and distribution systems (agriculture, food, and health). Our findings are consistent with evidence provided by recent literature on these topics, concerning the significant role played by these factors on global development and SDGs. Concerning education and human capital, Angrist et al (2021) [36], Pubule et. al (2021), [37] and Ryymin (2021) [38] provide evidence supporting our results and the need for an integrated approach to these topics, supported by innovation frameworks, digitalization, knowledge governance strategies and knowledge-sharing systems. Institutional capacity, finance, and international market/trade were ranked as relatively less important, although all factors are considered important (Fig 1B).
Solutions to achieve SDG1 and SDG2
STI solutions such as improved infrastructure, agriculture, and food distribution systems in low- and middle-income countries (representing roads, ICT, post-harvest technologies, etc.) obtained the highest degree of importance for SDG 1 and SDG 2, followed by equitable access to innovation to fight poverty and strong national innovation systems (Fig 2). Prioritization of local innovation also obtained the same importance for SDG1 and SDG2, while free access to intellectual property received a much lower score.
Our findings agree with recent literature data on ICT and post-harvest technologies concerning the major role played by these factors on global development, sustainability and achievement of SDGs, especially with respect to SDG1 and SDG2. Evidence from these studies corroborate our findings and indicate the critical role played by local innovations [39,40] and the presence of good infrastructure for improving sustainability practices in development projects both in agriculture, supporting food distribution systems [41]) and health, supporting distribution and availability of vaccine and drugs [4244].
Solutions to achieve SDG3 and COVID-19 recovery
The same approach was applied in the health section to assess how STI solutions are relevant to achieving SDG3 targets and COVID-19 recovery. The importance of six solutions is shown in Fig 3 below.
Equitable access to innovation (vaccines, diagnostics) was considered the most important factor in achieving SDG3 and COVID-19 recovery, followed by affordability and distribution of vaccines and other medical products, proper infrastructure for rapid scaling and distributing medicines, vaccines, and food to the population (e.g., cold storage facilities in remote areas) and low-cost healthcare innovation (Fig 3). As reported by Lehoux et al (2015) [45], our findings further underscore the need to address equity and sustainability challenges as related to lack of access to health innovation (including vaccines and diagnostics) and limited infrastructures that are resulting to poor delivery of healthcare services in LMICs. The cost-effectiveness of the innovation and free access to intellectual property were rated lower relative to the other issues, but were still deemed important (above 4). The fact that the two factors were deemed important suggests that the STI approach to health innovation is primarily driven by dominant multinational IPR and speculative investment where short-term profits/returns supersede long-term health gains and well-being of society in poor countries [45,46].
The importance of accessing innovations and complementary solutions in strengthening the distribution infrastructure is critical in achieving SDG3. A reliable supply chain infrastructure in conjunction with information systems would facilitate rapid scale-up of clinical solutions and relevant knowledge of safe and effective use of STIs at the local levels. Furthermore, for affordable STI solutions to be developed, additional effort is required to improve the capacity to generate evidence at multiple levels from evaluating the STI with respect to safety, equity, and local adaption to optimize the potential benefit at the community level. Hence, the improvements and alignments of digital and transport distribution infrastructure are equally important [47]. Investment in improving generic digital and health literacy at the local community level would enhance the readiness for rapid scale-up of STI solutions such as COVID-19 testing and vaccine rollout.
Solutions to achieve SDG7 and SDG13
With respect to the environment and energy sector, respondents evaluated the role of STI in achieving SDG7 and SDG13. Access and affordability of clean technology fuels obtained the highest mean score rating, followed by the development of human capacity for the development and deployment of clean and affordable energy technologies and low-cost technologies (Fig 4). Renewable energy sector is strongly connected with climate change mitigation and adaptation and numerous literature evidence have established their correlation and interdependency, especially in terms of research and development, access and affordability of clean technologies. For example, the IPCC report [48] argues the that lack of R&amp;D represents a significant challenge to deployment of clean technologies in low-and middle-income countries, which is in line with our findings. Financing was also a major factor driving STI in meeting SDG7 and SDG13, though considered slightly less important than the top three in implementing the sustainable development agenda. Yet, weak financing instruments undermine the implementation of low carbon technologies in LMICs [49,50]. Flexible access to IP obtained the lowest mean score, but once again, all factors were considered important (above 4.0).

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pstr.0000085.g004
While LMICs have increased R&amp;D expenditures over the past two decades, these are still relatively low in many countries. For example, Sub-Sahara Africa invests an average of 0.25% of GDP in R&amp;D programs despite recommendations by the Africa Union to invest at least 1% [51,52]. Without substantial financial resources, LMICs cannot implement green economy projects (SDG7) or perhaps meet the Paris Climate Agreement (SDG13). While the importance of STI for achieving the SDGs is well-recognized in high income countries, STI policy applications to support sustainable development goals are limited in many developing countries due to financial and structural impediments [53,54].
Intended and rebound effects
The role of STI in mediating SDG linkages remains mostly unexplored. Behavioral and systemic responses that counteract environmental gains from technological change, so-called rebound effects, could expose hidden barriers toward an internally consistent application of the SDG framework. For example, the linkages between energy, poverty, and climate goals are mediated via energy efficiency improvements [55]. A better understanding of rebound effects could improve our understanding of STI-mediated SDG interlinkages, investigate the SDG frameworks consistency as a whole, and assist in identifying appropriate management strategies to mitigate undesired effects.
This is in line with the recommendations of the International Council for Science and the International Social Science Council (2015) to associate goals with specific resource intensity targets [56]. To capture stakeholders views and guide future research, respondents were also asked to rate the importance of various STI-mediated reinforcing (mutually beneficial) and conflicting (mutually hindering) interactions between individual STI interventions to achieve the SDG framework. Interactions focused on rebound effects, often observed in policies aimed to increase the efficiency of utility services (e.g., energy and water efficiency) and land/agriculture productivity [57].
For each topic, reinforcing interactions were generally rated higher than conflicting ones across demographic groups while also describing the highest variation or lower consensus (Fig 5). Our results describe a stark contrast with the focus of the rebound effect literature, which is dominated by conflicting interactions on energy efficiency and energy in general [58]. Such interactions are perceived among the least important (average score of 3.5 for energy efficiency) while also describing the highest asymmetry between conflicting and reinforcing mechanisms. The detrimental effects of energy inefficiency on energy use and related carbon emissions is also widely acknowledged as critical to sustainable development and environmental policy effectiveness [57,59]. Our results may suggest that, rather than being insignificant, this particular topic may be factored in. In other words, the current body of evidence is extensive and research on this topic already yields low marginal returns in this context. In addition, the mainstream research focuses on the detrimental effects from energy efficiency, which may be perceived as insufficient to unravel the complex interactions that impede the achievement of the SDG framework. Demographic variables cannot be disregarded as mainstream research is largely carried out by males from academic institutions in high-income countries. In line with recent calls for a greater alignment with sustainability science [60], and with the help of stakeholders views, greater efforts must be redirected towards reinforcing interactions to unveil welfare-enhancing effects as well as overlooked topics such as agricultural land productivity and increased water use efficiency. Clear goals and metrics should be established, and activities planned for each STI initiative to improve clarity and accountability.
From the outset, the SDG framework lacked a systems approach that addresses the inherent linkages across goals and targets. In fact, progress towards one goal could either hinder or reinforce progress towards other goals [61,62] as supported by stakeholders viewpoints.
Below, we present a framework for STI cooperation for the SDGs focusing on four dimensions: national planning, resource and capacity building, engagement and partnerships, and access to innovation to deal with the challenges and issues in achieving the SDGs (Fig 6). These dimensions are elaborated in Table 1 and also touch on significant aspects of each dimension that can foster STI cooperation. Further, these dimensions reflect the authors viewpoints supported by survey data, which are described across a wide range of STI issues for achieving SDGs. The dimensions highlight the need to gain insights into potential multi-sectoral inter-linkages across SDGs to enhance cooperation among various actors at the national or global level. These insights would be a prerequisite for understanding broader consequences relating to the application of STI and collective action in evaluating them. With this approach, an integrated natural and social sciences will be useful to policymakers, the research community, the business community and the broader society in innovation thinking, interactive design, transition management, awareness creation and responsible scaling as well as multidisciplinary sustainability science for the achievement of the sustainable development agenda such as SDGs [6365].
Discussion and conclusion
Our findings reveal some fundamental challenges that could undermine the effective implementation of SDGs in LMICs. Challenges such as the lack of proper engagement of the global south scientific community and lack of interdisciplinary are hurdles that should be addressed to foster STI collaboration between the global South and North. Identifying and prioritizing SDG interactions require scientific collaboration through an interdisciplinary approach [66]. The global community should encourage scientific research partnership opportunities for the global South to unlock transformational capacity of science, research and training while sharing its gains equitably. It is important to encourage interdisciplinary research partnership that allows contributions from natural sciences, social sciences, life science and engineering among others. SDGs will not be achieved without emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinarity and scientific engagement within STI systems at the national and international levels [18,66].
Indigenous knowledge and frugal innovation could be recognized as critical components of STI towards the achievement of SDGs in low-and-middle income countries. Moreover, the fact that indigenous knowledge and frugal innovation do not reflect the broader objectives of the SDGs have drawn criticism from various key stakeholders [56,6769]. This essentially means that the way in which either local knowledge or frugal innovation is perceived has not received much-needed attention from the key actors especially the UN body, international donors and the private sector. The failure to recognize that development needs must take into consideration Indigenous peoples experiences in LMICs may undermine the achievement of SDGs at the local level. Our study is in agreement with Cummings (2017) who argued that the SDGs are fundamentally flawed because they are not based on local realities and local knowledge[70] p22). Furthermore, the lack of specific mentions of frugal innovation in the formulation of SDGs suggests that its contributions to sustainable development in rural areas may be overlooked. Yet, frugal innovation offers a promising approach for sustainable development through frugal enterprises and economic growth as well as social-influence impacting aspects such as poverty and health concerns. A growing body of literature has documented the critical role of frugal solutions in terms of sustainable enterprise, business model, supply chain management and environmental sustainability at the grass root level in low-and-middle income regions [71,72]. The authors argued that frugal innovation such as low-cost technologies can deliver affordable solutions to consumers in important sectors including agriculture, education and health. In light of this potential, it is therefore important to harness the transformational role of local knowledge and local innovations to achieve the SDGs.
The role of ICT and agricultural technologies as relevant STI solutions cannot be overemphasized in improving agricultural productivity and the food system, while tackling poverty in low-and-middle income countries. Currently, inappropriate land use and food systems are contributing to persistent hunger, malnutrition, and obesity [73], with poverty being a leading cause of persistent hunger. At the same time, agriculture and food systems underpinned by STI present a means to reduce poverty and ensure sustainable, safe, equitable and healthy diets for all [25]. Several studies indicate that new technologies and innovations are required to transition to sustainable agriculture and food systems to achieve economic growth, and human and planetary health [25,7476]. The importance of STI solutions in strengthening the agricultural and food system is vital for escaping poverty (SDG1) in agriculture-based economies such as sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. As noted in the era of green agricultural technology revolution, STI approaches such as improved infrastructure and national research and development programs tailored towards high-yielding varieties helped efforts in hunger and poverty reduction in Asia [77]. A strong R&amp;D system supported by STI competencies calls for planning development projects that mainstream SDG2 into national innovation policies in low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, integrating STI policy into national development planning in relevant sectors is critical to achieving the SDGs.
The STI cooperation between high-income and low- and middle-income countries underscores the role of STI in achieving the SDGs in agriculture, health, environment, and energy systems using key indicators to solicit viewpoints from different stakeholder groups. The survey respondents considered education and human capital (4.86 out of 5) as the most significant factor for STI cooperation, followed by policies and governance (4.68) and infrastructure (4.66). Respondents viewpoints suggest that interventions in science and innovation skills and industrial policies are limited in most low- and middle-income regions. The fact that education and human capital were best rated for STI cooperation among respondents means that national and international governments need to pay adequate attention on investments in human capital development, research and acquisition of basic skills, to foster effective implementation of SDGs. Specifically, national governments should promote the creation of opportunities for industries by supporting scientific R&amp;D for innovation-driven economies, and build their abilities through education and training policies. The research gap between high-income and low- and middle-income countries reflects the underlying challenges for international STI cooperation. The fact that STI human resource capacity is still very weak in many developing countries, even in the middle-income ones, suggests that achievement of SDGs 1, 2, 3, 7 and 13 will require strengthening the educational system, increasing investment in R&amp;D programs and providing adequate infrastructure and expertise for the requisite skills and competencies to foster STI cooperation. According to Fonseca et al. (2020), SDG1 (poverty elimination), and SDG3 (good health and well-being) have synergetic relationships with most of the SDGs, while SDG7 (affordable and clean energy) has a significant relationship with other SDGs (e.g., SDG1, SDG2 (zero hunger), SDG3, SDG8 (decent work and economic growth), and SDG13 (climate action)). Hence, effective measures for advancing the SDGs and, ultimately, sustainable development for all demands that the relationships and interactions between the SDGs must be identified and tackled. In this sense, the discussion on conflicting and reinforcing effects following the rebound effect framework and the body of work sheds relevant insights for further research and ultimately towards an effective implementation of the SDG framework. Furthermore the SDGs synergies and trade-offs represent an opportunity for policy and decision-makers by suggesting that the frequently linear development paths of economic growth ahead of social equity and environmental protection might be challenged by other systematic approaches that offer multiple solutions and drivers for different contexts.
In this regard, the four key components of the framework (Fig 6) will require many low- and middle-income countries, if not most, to undertake a shift in public policy at the national level for STI cooperation. Achieving SDGs in many low- and middle-income countries will depend on both domestic innovation and catching up technologically to position their national innovation system and policy environment to take the best advantage of knowledge transfer at the global level for STI cooperation.
For STI cooperation to happen, the transformation of industry, universities and research institutes in low- and middle-income countries is crucial to complement mutual strengths and a win-win approach in key areas, such as institutional policy and governance structure, higher level of scientific training, entrepreneurship, research infrastructure, legal framework and technology transfer.
STI solutions for SDGs should be created, including co-funding of R&amp;D by international donors and national governments and effective protection of intellectual property rights, but not to the point where it restricts access to frontier technologies and discourages private sector innovation. A committed and systematic approach can overcome technical, legal, and institutional barriers related to financing STI solutions in low- and middle-income countries.
Capacity-building programs for STI need to be implemented at the sub-national, national, and regional levels, aiming for whole-of-country capacity-building rather than narrow, single-industry approaches. Further, the aim should be to build the necessary capabilities for novel developments, not just the capacity to utilize existing technologies. Complementary investments in educational and research infrastructure are crucial.
Our survey findings and allied research indicate that Science, Technology, and Innovation can be powerful tools to reduce social exclusion and extreme poverty in the world, and are much needed, for example, in the current COVID-19 pandemic. STI can also contribute to improved quality of and access to public services. Although scientists have historically made significant contributions to innovation and technological development of processes and products, only a small part of these contributions have effectively been incorporated into global social welfare. This scenario urgently needs to be changed. New STI governance structures, policy strategies and incentives for Southern scientists are required to successfully integrate STI policy into social policies.
Limitation and future research
The study is beyond the scope of assessments of the impacts of STI for achieving SDGs in low-and-middle income countries as the study only focuses on the viewpoints of selected stakeholder groups around the world. The viewpoints of these stakeholders are not representative of all, which is one of the limitations of this study. In addition, almost 200 respondents were analyzed across thematic topics so it is not possible to generalize the results. Given the importance of this study and its contribution to the literature on STI/SDG, it is worth assessing the impacts of STI towards achieving SDGs at the national and regional levels. In this regard, this study can help gain insight into the role of each component in tackling the challenges in SDGs and interactions across different goals, while considering the synergies and trade-offs in the process leading to the achievement of SDGs.

Biggest markets: The U.S., China and France.
Putting the unique nature of 2021 aside, 2022 saw L’Oréal register its best growth in “more than 20 years,” on a like-for-like basis and in three decades on a reported basis. Its revenues in the final three months of the year alone surpassed €10 billion, the first time ever it has seen such high sales in a single quarter.
“The L’Oréal engine is firing on all cylinders and these translate into an increase in our over-performance versus the market compared to the pre-COVID-19 period,” said chief executive officer Nicolas Hieronimus during the company’s year-end conference call in February.
Hieronimus said the group’s new geographical organization, put in place during the pandemic, has allowed it to enhance coherency in each region in terms of consumer profiles and market maturity, allowing it to maximize growth and control costs better.
Currency impacts had a major impact on the group’s reported numbers — more than 7%.
All its divisions grew well in like-for-like terms: 10.1% for Professional Products, 10.2% for L’Oréal Luxe despite the turbulence of the Chinese market, Active Cosmetics at +21.9% — the division has almost doubled its sales since 2019, according to L’Oréal — and 8.3% at Consumer Products, that division’s best growth rate in 20 years.
Even in mainland China, L’Oréal’s sales rose 5.5% in a declining market, boosted by double-digit growth in e-commerce and a strong performance on Singles’ Day, according to the company.
Consumer Products grew 8.3% on a global mass beauty market that was up 6% for the year, according to L’Oréal. Average price increases accounted for a large part of that growth, but volumes were also up 2.6%. L’Oréal Paris — once again the world’s biggest beauty brand — gained 7% and Garnier was up 8%, thanks to its harnessing of green science and innovation. Maybelline and NYX Professional, driven by a rebound in makeup, gained 16% and 21% respectively. Hair care grew double digits for the division too, thanks to a premiumized offer, gaining twice as fast as the market, L’Oréal said.
For the Professional Products division, L’Oréal grew 10.1% on a market that it estimated at plus 5%. Kérastase surpassed €1 billion in sales for the first time, becoming the division’s second “billionaire brand.” The division saw sales up 32% in China, now its number-two country, and gained 50% in India. As the division continued to ramp up omnichannel and retail beyond its traditional salon focus, e-commerce and specialty retail represented 30% of its revenues.
L’Oréal Luxe reportedly outperformed the buoyant prestige beauty market as a whole for the 12th year running, finishing up 18.6% at reported rates and up 10.2% like-for-like on an overall market that gained 8%. Luxury skin care gained 7%, while the market was up 2%, thanks to gains in the ultra-high-end segment with Helena Rubinstein and Lancôme Absolue, as well as the addition of Takami and Youth to the People to the portfolio. In the fast-growing fragrance category, L’Oréal gained 23% on a market up 17%, despite supply chain challenges. Libre by Yves Saint Laurent consolidated its position, and was the number-three scent in Europe. Prada Paradoxe, introduced last fall, was the top women’s fragrance launch of the year, according to L’Oréal. In the artisanal category, Asia was a high point for Maison Margiela, with sales up 19%. In makeup, Saint Laurent and the revamped Urban Decay drove double-digit gains. In North Asia, the division saw sales up 8% on an overall luxury beauty market that declined 2%. It said it registered its highest ever market share on the Chinese local market, at 30%. The division also gained market share in Asian travel retail. In North America, it saw sales up 7%, slightly below the market, as it sought to revamp its business. Sellout there accelerated in the second half, L’Oréal said. Sales in Europe gained 16%, with double-digit growth seen in Germany, Spain, Italy and the U.K.
In October, L’Oréal said it was implementing a new fragrance branch inside L’Oréal Luxe encompassing Maison Margiela, Atelier Cologne, Viktor &amp; Rolf, Azzaro, Diesel and Cacharel, with Sandrine Groslier — who joined the company with its purchase of the Clarins fragrance business in 2020 and had been global president of Mugler Azzaro Beauté and Fashion under L’Oréal — as its global president. The aim of the division is to enrich the group’s expertise and develop its mono-axis brands in line with the global explosion of the fragrance category, Groslier said at the time. Oversight of Mugler was handed over to Danièle Lahana-Aidenbau.
For the Active Cosmetics division — which was renamed L’Oréal Dermatological Beauty at the beginning of 2023 — L’Oréal said it grew 2.4 times faster than the market. La Roche-Posay was the world’s leading dermocosmetics brand, growing 23% and becoming the world’s sixth biggest skin care brand all segments combined. CeraVe gained 38% and was the number-two dermocosmetics brand worldwide and the number two across skin care in the U.S. Its growth was attributed in large part to its international expansion since it entered the L’Oréal fold. It continued to ramp up its presence in medical skin care with the acquisition of Skinbetter Science. The division grew three times faster than the market in the U.S. and six times faster in China, L’Oréal said. Its sales in emerging markets gained 26%.
Regionally, Europe was the biggest contributor to L’Oréal’s growth last year, with sales up 11.6% like-for-like. The company also reported a turnaround for its business in North America, which exceeded €10 billion in sales for the first time and saw like-for-like growth of 10.4%. In February 2022, David Greenberg was named chief executive officer of L’Oréal USA and president of the North America zone.
North Asia gained 6.6% like-for-like, thanks in part to double-digit gains in Japan and South Korea. In India, L’Oréal grew at twice the pace of the market overall.
Overall, brick-and-mortar returned to growth, gaining 11.7%, while e-commerce increased 8.9% and accounted for upwards of 28% of total sales.
On the sustainability front, L’Oréal said 97% of its new products and renovations are now eco-designed, with major advances in refillable solutions over the past year and three quarters of PET packaging now coming from recycled sources — 82% of its hair care bottles were made from recycled plastic last year. The company invested €22 million in ecosystem redevelopment and €30.8 million to support vulnerable women around the world in 2022.

It was another turbulent year for Unilever. In September, Alan Jope announced that he would step down in 2023 after five years at the helm of the firm. The year also saw activist investor Nelson Peltz join Unilever’s board of directors after its botched attempt to take over GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer business.
Hein Schumacher will take over as Unilever’s new CEO this July. Currently CEO of Royal FrieslandCampina, an international dairy and nutrition business with €11 billion in annual turnover, he was named a non-executive director of Unilever last year.
Initiated under Jope, 2022 also saw Unilever implement its new structure aiming to make the business simpler and more category focused. Its Beauty &amp; Personal Care activity was split in two, creating the Beauty &amp; Wellbeing and Personal Care entities.
The company said the new structure is already reaping benefits, allowing bolder and more rapid decision-making and improved accountability.
Unilever is also seeking to double down on its high-performing beauty and wellness categories. In the latter, it snapped up a majority stake in Nutrafol, a high-end hair growth supplement brand. This February, it announced the sale of personal care and beauty brand Suave in North America to Yellow Wood Partners as it shifts toward what it views as strategic growth spaces.
In a context of inflation and supply chain woes, Unilever succeeded in weathering the storm and growing top line, in large part thanks to price increases and the premiumization of its offer, although in most categories, volumes declined. For the Beauty &amp; Wellbeing activity, this was the case for both skin care and hair care. Acquisitions added 3.8 percentage points to sales for the division, meanwhile.
In hair care, Sunsilk and Nexxus drove gains. Latin America, India and Turkey grew for the category, offset by weaker business in Europe and China. Skin care was driven by South and Southeast Asia, helped by Lifebuoy and the rollout of Vaseline’s Gluta-Hya products. Vaseline was one of the fastest-growing brands in the portfolio, and was boosted by the slugging trend on social media, with Gen Z users praising its benefits on TikTok. The brand saw double-digit gains in the U.S. and strong growth in China, now its second market. AHC saw sales declines in North Asia.
Prestige Beauty continued to grow faster than the portfolio overall, with volume gains and double-digit sales growth, topping €1 billion in revenues, benefiting from growth in the premium segment, especially in skin care. Launch highlights included Living Proof Triple Bond Complex, Dermalogica Milkfoliant and Tatcha Indigo Overnight Repair Serum. The 2021 acquisition of Paula’s Choice and Hourglass’s continued expansion into China, as well as Living Proof, bolstered sales.
In Personal Care, volume declines were higher in skin cleansing, particularly impacted by cost inflation. Volumes in the category held up better in North America, Unilever said, supported by premium innovations like Dove Deep Moisture body wash with microbiome nutrient serum. Dove took its Real Beauty mission into the virtual world, creating an online coalition dubbed Real Virtual Beauty to encourage developers to create a healthier, more diverse representation of women and girls in games worldwide.
Deodorants did well, with volumes up and double-digit sales gains. Rexona — according to Nielsen data, the world’s number-one antiperspirant and deodorant brand with annual sales of more than €2 billion — relaunched its core range globally, with what it claims is its most effective deodorant yet. Sales of Dollar Shave Club fell, and the company registered an impairment charge of €192 million related to that business.
Among other activities, SheaMoisture ramped up its initiatives to create new opportunities helping Black entrepreneurs to thrive and published its inaugural impact report.
Clear, reportedly the world’s leading shampoo brand for men, introduced its first premium range targeting scalp health to prevent hair fall, initially in China.
Dove and Unilever’s other PETA-approved brands joined forces with The Body Shop and NGOs to launch #SaveCrueltyFreeCosmetics, backed by a European Citizens’ Initiative, a mechanism designed to help European people shape policy by calling on the European Commission to propose new laws, in this case to protect the EU’s ban on animal testing for cosmetics. Unilever was also a founding member of European cosmetics companies’ Cosmetics Europe Commitment for our Planet Initiative.
3.THE ESTÉE LAUDER COS. 
NEW YORK
2022 BEAUTY SALES:
$16.4 BILLION (EST.)
-7.8% vs. 2021 (EST.)
MAIN BRANDS: Estée Lauder, Aramis, Clinique, Lab Series, Origins, MAC, La Mer, Bobbi Brown, Aveda, Jo Malone London, Bumble and bumble, Darphin Paris, Tom Ford Beauty, Smashbox, Aerin Beauty, Le Labo, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, Glamglow, Killian Paris, Too Faced, Dr. Jart+, Deciem: The Ordinary, Niod.
KEY FINANCIALS:
Skin care: $8.76 billion (EST.), -14%; 54% of total sales
Makeup: $4.43 billion (EST.), -2%; 27% of total sales
Fragrance: $2.48 billion (EST.), +7%; 15% of total sales
Hair: $643 million (EST.), +6%; 4% of total sales
China and Tom Ford dominated the news when it came to the beauty giant for 2022. Rising COVID-19 cases in China continued to weigh on The Estée Lauder Cos. during the crucial holiday season, triggering declines on both the top and bottom line in its fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31.
“All told, our return to growth has shifted to the fourth quarter,” said Fabrizio Freda, president and CEO in an earnings call. “We are encouraged by both our strong momentum in numerous markets globally and improving macro trends.”
The company cited the evolution of the COVID-19 environment, including restrictions in mainland China and the rising number of COVID-19 cases, as causes of stronger headwinds as the quarter progressed. As a result, tourism and product shipments to Hainan remained largely curtailed and traffic in brick-and-mortar in the rest of China was limited.
At the same time, the business was also negatively impacted by the strong U.S. dollar, along with inflationary pressures and recession concerns, which caused certain retailers in the U.S. to tighten inventory.
During the year, Lauder announced an agreement to acquire Tom Ford, marking the beauty giant’s first venture into the fashion world. The acquisition is Lauder’s largest to date, following the company’s agreement to pay $2.2 billion for a majority position in Deciem in 2021. As part of the deal, Ermenegildo Zegna Group and Marcolin SpA entered into long-term license agreements for Tom Ford fashion and Tom Ford eyewear, respectively. The deal valued the total enterprise of Tom Ford at $2.8 billion. The amount to be paid by Lauder for the acquisition is approximately $2.3 billion, net of a $250 million payment to Lauder at closing from Marcolin SpA. Funded through a combination of cash, debt and deferred payments, it is expected to close in the fiscal fourth quarter ending this June.
Freda has previously said that Tom Ford Beauty, of which it already held the license prior to the acquisition, is expected to achieve $1 billion in net sales annually over the next couple of years, “having promising profitable growth opportunities ahead.”
Staying in M&amp;A, through its New Incubation Ventures arm, Lauder took a minority stake in Haeckels, owned by its founder Dom Bridges and angel investors, last February. It also made a long-term, global licensing agreement for Balmain Beauty, including collaboratively developing, producing and distributing luxury beauty products, the first of which are expected to launch in fall 2024.
Elsewhere in the business, Glamglow, the one-time hot indie skin care brand that Lauder acquired in 2014 for an undisclosed amount, is following in the footsteps of sister brand Smashbox and exiting the U.K. and Ireland. The company continued to wind down the Aramis &amp; Designer Fragrances division.
Aveda, meanwhile, launched in mainland China and The Ordinary entered India.
Lauder opened a distribution center for its travel-retail business in Switzerland, as well as its first manufacturing facility in Asia Pacific and a China Innovation Labs in Shanghai as it positions to capture growth and accelerate locally relevant innovation.
There were also some changes to the executive structure. John Demsey, the executive group president who oversaw brands including MAC, Clinique, Too Faced, Glamglow, Smashbox and Tom Ford Beauty, was asked to leave the business after he posted a meme on Instagram that contained a racial slur and joke about COVID-19, while group president of international Cedric Prouvé retired in June. Peter Jueptner, previously in charge of EMEA business, replaced him. The group’s brands are now organized in two clusters led by executive group presidents Jane Hertzmark Hudis and Stéphane de La Faverie.
One person who doesn’t look likely to be going anywhere soon, however, is Freda. Despite speculation about who could lead The Estée Lauder Cos. next, Freda, who is 65, said he is “completely committed to continue leading this company for the foreseeable future.”

Organic growth 2022: +2%
P&amp;G Beauty delivered moderate organic sales growth despite the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in China across  the hair, skin and personal care categories. Overall beauty sales, however, declined 1% year-over-year, while currency fluctuations also weighed on the company.
Among the category mix, growth in P&amp;G’s Hair Care portfolio was largely broad-based, although partially offset by a decline across P&amp;G Hair Care’s China portfolio due to COVID-related headwinds. Pantene remained the number-one  selling hair care brand in the world, according to Euromonitor.
SK-II was challenged by lockdowns and travel restrictions within China, which severely hampered the brand’s duty-free business.
P&amp;G’s personal care division, meanwhile, grew consistently with strong double-digits sales across the year, spanning Old Spice, Safeguard and Secret.
During 2022, P&amp;G Beauty acquired three specialty brands. First, it doubled down on skin care with the acquisition of Farmacy Beauty. Then it entered the fast-growing prestige hair care market with an agreement to acquire Ouai, celebrity hairstylist Jen Atkin’s hair care and lifestyle brand. Lastly, it acquired Tula — a probiotic, superfoods-based skin care line founded by gastroenterologist Roshini Raj, Bobbi Brown cofounder Ken Landis and tech entrepreneur Dan Reich. 
In March 2022, it announced the formation of P&amp;G Specialty Beauty, a new subdivision that includes these brands along with First Aid Beauty. Inclusive of previous acquisitions Native and Walker &amp; Co, these acquired brands continue to grow disproportionately, with a collective sales increase of about 50% vs. year ago, according to P&amp;G. 
Most recently, in 2023, P&amp;G Beauty acquired Mielle Organics, a Black-founded textured hair care brand that is sold at major mass retailers, including Walmart, Target and CVS, for an undisclosed sum, with the founders stressing that the deal will increase availability of products, and that there are no plans to change formulas.
In 2022 executive moves, Chris Heiert was named senior vice president, specialty beauty, while Stephanie Headley was promoted to senior vice president, Global Olay.

Shiseido, Japan’s largest beauty company, celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2022 with an eye to the future. The year marked the second year of its three year “Win 2023 and Beyond” strategy, which was ideated to counteract the impact of COVID-19 at home and abroad. Under the strategy, Shiseido has executed a global transformation with an emphasis on profitability and cash flow, by focusing on “skin beauty,” and restructuring its portfolio. For 2022, which the company designated a “Back to Growth” year, the emphasis was on promoting global brands, accelerating the company’s digital transformation, and building new factories and logistics systems. The plan worked: Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew 10.7%, although sales in Japan increased a modest 1.3% and the business in China declined by 10.7%. However, sales in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region gained 10% and the Americas saw an increase of 7.7%. Travel retail bounced back with a 15.2% gain.
As part of the focus on skin beauty, Shiseido sold its Shiseido Professional brand, whose hair care, color, styling and perm products are sold primarily in Japan and Asia, to Henkel. Shiseido retains 20% of the shares of the company succeeding the assets related to its business in Japan, with the aim to support the further growth of the business.
Following the transfer of its personal care business to Fine Today in July 2021, Shiseido announced the transfer of its manufacturing business of personal care products conducted at the Kuku Factory in Japan and its Vietnam facility in August 2022. Through the transfer, Shiseido seeks to support Fine Today in building a management system that integrates manufacturing and sales, aiding the company’s sustainable growth.
In September 2022, the company acquired Gallinée, a London-based brand dedicated to caring for the skin’s microbiome. The range offers a patented complex of prebiotics, probiotics and postbiotics that nourish and strengthen the skin’s microbiome.
During the year, Shiseido launched three brands around its core business. Sidekick, a men’s skin care brand, launched in Japan and China, with the positioning of highlighting young men’s individuality and style.
Another brand that launched in Japan and China was Inryu, a three-sku line created to improve the overall health of the skin from the inside.
In Europe, Shiseido launched Ulé, the first skin care brand powered by vertical farming with a view to creating the future of botanical beauty. In France, Ulé cultivates plants from around the world on its Eco-Farm, which executives said enables it to maintain a short supply chain, lessen the environmental impact and retain maximum freshness and potency.
Shiseido also invested in strengthening its China business, and has been focusing on innovation with local partners. In August, it announced it is investing in Jiangsu Trautec Mecial Technology, a company dedicated to the development and production of recombinant collagen-based biomaterials. In collaboration with a local partner, Plug and Play China, Shiseido is looking for partners from Chinese startups to work on future innovations.
In January 2023, Shiseido announced a new management structure and succession plan. Masahiko Uotani became representative director, chairman and CEO of Shiseido Company Ltd., and Kentaro Fujiwara assumed the role of president and chief operating officer. Fujiwara was previously the CEO of Shiseido China, and it is expected that Uotani will pass the reins to him in the next two years.
On the sustainability front, Shiseido unveiled replaceable cosmetics packaging using a technology called LiquidForm, which realizes bottle molding and filling in a single step and reduces the use of plastic by 70% and CO2 emissions by 70%. To celebrate its 150th anniversary, Shiseido employees around the world held a day of service, Camellia Day, in which employees participated in social action programs to improve society and the environment.

Perfumes and Cosmetics Division profit from recurring operations: €660 million, -3.5% vs. 2021.
Continuing success in fragrance and a rebound in makeup drove LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton’s beauty business last year. Despite a significant sales increase overall, the ongoing impact of the pandemic in Asia weighed on business, particularly the skin care category. Asia outside Japan accounted for 35% of the beauty activity’s sales last year, compared with 42% a year earlier and 45% in 2020. The company said innovation played a key role in its brands’ advances in 2022.
Parfums Christian Dior grew strongly worldwide, reinforcing its position in Europe and with strong momentum in the U.S., Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, according to the company. Among the brand’s fragrances, Sauvage grew well — it was reportedly the world’s bestselling fragrance across categories. As the tide of popularity turned in favor of Johnny Depp, the scent’s face, following his highly media-covered defamation lawsuit against ex-wife Amber Heard, this provided a major boon to sales. J’adore benefited from the global launch of its Parfum d’Eau variant. Miss Dior did well and Dior Homme was boosted by the relaunch of Dior Homme Sport. High-end line Collection Privée also performed well, and added products by Francis Kurkdjian, the house’s new creative director of fragrances. In skin care, premium products including a new version of La Crème boosted sales. New lipsticks included a refillable version of Dior Addict and a new version of Forever liquid foundation. The brand also initiated a new sustainability roadmap for 2030, dubbed “Beauty as a Legacy,” with a broad range of targets including efforts to promote biodiversity and cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 46% by 2030.
Guerlain also did well in fragrances, especially in the high-end category with L’Art et la Matière and Aqua Allegoria. The label highlighted its sustainability commitments, with Angelina Jolie acting as the face of its “In the Name of Beauty” program.
Givenchy’s fragrance pillars, including L’Interdit and Irrésistible, also did well, and Gentleman introduced Réserve Privée, a collaboration with Glenmorangie whisky. Benefit enhanced its position in the brow category, where it is global market leader, with new products. Make Up For Ever was driven by an innovation program developed with its makeup artists. Kenzo Parfums grew thanks to L’Absolue, a new version of its pillar Flower by Kenzo scent. Maison Francis Kurkdjian saw strong gains in the U.S. and Europe and opened its first store in China. Acqua di Parma was driven by its Signatures of the Sun line, while Perfumes Loewe expanded internationally with a new point-of-sale concept, boosting sales. Fenty Beauty doubled revenues thanks to expanded distribution and launch activity, with Fenty Skin growing strongly in body care. Officine Universelle Buly, acquired by LVMH in 2021, expanded its footprint, especially in Japan, and profited from growing brand awareness in Paris.
In March this year, LVMH named Stéphane Rinderknech chairman and CEO of its Perfumes and Cosmetics division, overseeing all 15 of its brands, the first time in decades that the business unit has been managed under a single executive. Rinderknech, a former L’Oréal executive who was most recently ceo of L’Oréal USA and president of its North America zone, joined LVMH in 2022 to head its hotel and leisure activities. Reporting to him, Véronique Courtois takes up the reins at Parfums Christian Dior from Laurent Kleitman, who is leaving LVMH, and Gabrielle Saint-Genis Rodriguez takes over Courtois’ former role as the head of Guerlain. Courtois is the first female ceos for Parfums Christian Dior.

$7.24 BILLION (EST.)

Main Brands: Nivea, Eucerin, La Prairie, Labello, 8×4, Hidrofugal, Florena, Atrix, Aquaphor, Maestro, Coppertone.
Key Financials:
Consumer Division sales: €7.1 billion, +16.3% VS. 2021 (organic sales growth: +10.5%)
Consumer Division EBIT excluding special factors: €880 million, +18.9%
Consumer Division sales by region:

Latin America: €941 million, +43.4% (+28.6%)
Africa/Asia/Australia: €2.19 billion, +14% (+10.2%).
Beiersdorf benefited from consumer interest in skin health, and netted a strong year. Core brand Nivea gained market share in all regions but especially Europe, notably in Switzerland, the U.K. and Spain. Its total sales grew 13% to €4.65 billion, and there were gains in both volume and price, driven by emerging markets, new products and a strong performance of its basics. All key categories gained, especially deodorants, sun care and body care.
The Derma brands, Eucerin and Aquaphor, beat the billion-euro sales barrier for the first time, netting revenues of €1.03 billion, up a massive 29.9% in reported terms and 23.9% on an organic basis. The brands did particularly well in the U.S., Mexico and Germany. Eucerin’s face care, especially anti-pigmentation and acne products, were strong performers. The brand’s sun care launched in the U.S., the world’s largest market for the category. Online was an important driver for the segment.
Sales in the prestige segment gained 9.3%, to €655 million, thanks largely to recovery in travel-retail and the uptick in brick-and-mortar in North America, although La Prairie’s China business suffered. The February 2022 acquisition of Chantecaille allowed the company to strengthen its presence in the selective channel, notably in the U.S., China and South Korea, it said.
Exchange rate impacts positively impacted sales for the Consumer division as a whole by 4.6 percentage points, while the Chantecaille acquisition added 1.2 points to growth.
Beiersdorf implemented a new operating model for Nivea, based on marketing successes within the Derma and Luxury categories, as well as Health Care, to develop fewer but more impactful campaigns to improve the consistency of messaging and brand identity for its mega-brand.
For the prestige portfolio, management changes followed the integration of Chantecaille. Philippe Lamy joined La Prairie Group as CEO in March last year, taking over from Patrick Rasquinet, who is now concentrating on broader responsibilities as executive board member for the Pharmacy and Selective Divisions, overseeing Eucerin, Hansaplast, La Prairie and Chantecaille. Emily Coleman, a 20-year L’Oréal veteran most recently senior vice president at Urban Decay, took over from Sylvie Chantecaille as CEO of the brand in September.
Product innovation included Nivea Radiant &amp; Beauty, for consumers with melanin-rich skin. There were products developed especially for the Chinese and Asian markets, including Nivea Pro Sensitive Amino Acid face cleansing gel and the new Doukou body care range, as well as Eucerin Even Radiance. Beiersdorf also claimed it was the first skin care manufacturer to use ethanol made from recycled carbon dioxide, in the limited-edition Climate Care moisturizer under Nivea Men, which celebrated its centenary.
In December, the company announced it had acquired a majority stake in Belgium-based microbiome research specialist S-Biomedic, in which it had already invested in 2018.

KEY FINANCIALS:
Main markets: The U.S. China, Japan and France represented more than half of 2022 sales.
Fragrance and makeup were Chanel’s main contributors to sales growth in beauty last year, although skin care also reportedly gained well. Its travel-retail business recovered in Western regions, but continued to be impacted by pandemic restrictions on travel in Asia.
In fragrance, all of Chanel’s pillar scents returned to growth, with strong performances from Coco Mademoiselle, Chance and Bleu de Chanel. N°5, which performed particularly well in 2021, its centenary year, slowed somewhat.
Makeup grew, driven mainly by face and lip products, but remained below 2019 levels.
Skin care was boosted by the launch of new line N°1 de Chanel and by growth in Asia. No. 1, introduced in early 2022, is based on the camellia flower; it contains 97% natural ingredients and features eco-designed packaging. It is built around skin care, but also includes makeup products and a fragrance mist.
E-commerce sales grew worldwide, on both the brand’s own platforms and third-party sites. Retail expansion also continued, and Chanel opened more than 30 new boutiques, mainly in Asia.
In October, the house named a trio of global creative partners to steer the creation of its color cosmetics. Ammy Drammeh, Cécile Paravina and Valentina Li were named as the first artists to join the Cometes Collective, which is described by Chanel as “a group of emerging talents shaping the future of beauty” with a pluralistic vision focused on collaboration.
Other initiatives last year included an immersive exhibition dedicated to fragrances at the Grand Palais Ephémère in Paris, exploring their history through immersive installations and animations featuring scent pods and virtual reality.

SÃO PAULO
2022 BEAUTY SALES:
$7.05 BILLION
R$36.35 BILLION
-9.5% vs. 2021
MAIN BRANDS: Natura(fragrance, makeup, skin, hair, sun and body care, toiletries). Aesop (skin, body and hair care, fragrance). The Body Shop. Avon (outside North America).
Key Financials:
Constant-currency growth VS. 2021: +0.4%
Natura &amp; Co. Latin America net sales: R$22.03 billion, -1.7% (+6.3% at constant currency)
Avon International net sales: $R7.2 billion, -22.9% (-9.9%)
The Body Shop net sales: R$4.41 billion, -24.3% (-13.5%)
Aesop net sales: R$2.72 billion, +4.6% (+21%)
Gross profit: R$23.19 billion, -11%
Group consolidated net loss: R$2.86 billion, compared with net income of R$1.05 billion in 2021.
The challenges were both macroeconomic and structural for Brazil’s Natura &amp; Co. in 2022. The weakness of the Brazilian real weighed heavily on its numbers, as did its ongoing integration of Avon and challenges at The Body Shop, impacted by changes in consumer behavior since the pandemic.
Mid-year, Natura decided to press reset, transitioning to a simpler holding company structure to improve accountability for its four brands, Natura, Avon, The Body Shop and Aesop, now organized into four business units. The firm hopes the reorganization will help it reassess its growth model to stabilize the business, with the aim of improving profitability and cash conversion, revising its cost structure and reviewing its global footprint.
Roberto Marquez, who had headed Natura &amp; Co. for six years, stepped down as group CEO and executive chairman in June, at the time of the announcement, but remained on the company’s board to help the transition through year end. Natura &amp; Co. eliminated the roles of sustainable growth officer and chief transformation officer. Fábio Barbosa, previously a non-executive director, stepped in as CEO.
This March, L’Oréal said it would acquire Aesop, which continue to outperform Natura’s portfolio as a whole. Natura had put the brand up for sale in order to finance the brand’s accelerated growth and provide value to the parent company and its stakeholders.
As to its performance, Natura &amp; Co. said it saw improvement in constant-currency sales in the fourth quarter, and that it had made progress on the initiatives put in place.
The Natura brand saw strong momentum in the last three months of the year, especially in Brazil, driven by consultant productivity and strong performance at retail, with the brand expanding its brick-and-mortar footprint significantly through the year. It also saw gains in the rest of Latin America despite political and economic instability in the region, notably in Argentina, Chile and Peru.
Avon’s revenues in Brazil and Latin America declined for the year as a whole, but improved significantly in the fourth quarter as Natura continues to restructure the brand, moving away from non-core categories and homing in on beauty. The company said this strengthened its confidence in the potential for ongoing integration of that business in the region. Its plans for Avon include optimizing the brand’s international footprint to focus on profitable markets and reducing its cost structure.
Natura said it was “rightsizing” The Body Shop’s business, focusing on efficiencies and the brand’s core retail model in the face of challenging channel mix changes, notably in the U.K., its core market. It announced plans to shutter The Body Shop at Home in the U.S. and close its dedicated distribution center in the U.K., as well as restructure its global management, reducing leadership positions by 25% and global overhead staffing by 12%. The actions are intended to support margin expansion, cash generation and revenue stabilization for the long term.
Aesop continued to outperform. The brand leaned into fragrance and made its hotly anticipated entry into China in the fourth quarter, with two physical stores and a domestic Tmall platform, exceeding expectations there.

Coty performed well in 2022, spurred on by what CEO Sue Y. Nabi called the fragrance effect. Despite recession fears and sky-high inflation, Coty’s prestige fragrances were key to is performance, and in its latest earnings briefing, it cited recent innovations in its offering, including Burberry Hero Eau de Parfum and Burberry Her Elixir de Parfum, Hugo Boss Bottled Parfum and Gucci Flora Gorgeous Jasmine as delivering strong performances during the final three months of last year.
In 2022, Coty sold its Lacoste fragrance license back to Lacoste by mutual agreement for an undisclosed sum, effective this year, and renewed its licenses with Hugo Boss. WWD understands Lacoste has a big footprint in Russia, an area from which Coty divested due to its invasion of Ukraine.
Coty’s strong performance in fragrance came as the industry grappled with a shortage of glass and other materials such as oils and alcohol, while the energy crisis has driven up glass prices.
In the prestige sector, Coty launched Skkn by Kim in partnership with Kim Kardashian — a pricey $630 direct-to-consumer, nine-step system, including a toner, exfoliator, hyaluronic acid serum, vitamin C8 serum, face cream, eye cream, oil drops and a night oil. Meanwhile, Kylie Jenner’s brand, Kylie Cosmetics, rolled out in Brazil and Mexico. 
Coty released new targets to double its skin care sales, reaching between $500 million to $600 million by fiscal 2025. As part of this, it will take Skkn by Kim and Kylie Skin, already anchored in North America, into EMEA in the coming years. Kylie Skin will also be heading to Australia as part of the plan.
In mass, Coty saw strong momentum in most of its key brands in the three months to the end of December, with single-digit to double-digit revenue growth across Cover Girl, Rimmel, Max Factor, Adidas and Monange. 2022 also saw Queen Latifah rejoin Cover Girl.
On the human resources front, Coty inaugurated a gender-neutral parental leave policy, while Andrew Stanleick left his role as executive vice president, Americas and global ceo of Coty’s joint venture with Kylie Jenner’s Kylie Cosmetics and Kim Kardashian West’s KKW Beauty brand to become ceo of Beauty Health. Anna von Bayern, Coty’s chief corporate affairs officer, now helms the Kardashian/Jenner brands. Dr. Shimei Fan was named chief scientific officer.
11.BATH &amp; BODY WORKS
COLUMBUS, OHIO
2022 BEAUTY SALES
$4.6 BILLION (EST.)
-1.2% vs. 2021 (EST.)
MAIN BRANDS: Bath &amp; Body Works (fragrance, body care, hand care).
KEY FINANCIALS:
U.S.: 85% of sales
In 2022, Bath &amp; Body Works, whose main three categories are body care, home fragrance and soaps and sanitizers, saw total sales slightly decrease by 1.2%.
Within that, body care slipped 0.8% to $3.03 billion, soaps and sanitizers were down 8.6% to $1.06 billion, while gifting increased 15.8% to $507 million.
Bath &amp; Body Works’ men’s business continued to be its fastest-growing category in body care as it tested new forms and merchandising ideas, while the U.S. remained its biggest market, accounting for 85% of total sales.
Its loyalty program launched nationwide in August, with the company stating that its enrollment speed is one of the fastest in the industry, with 33 million members to date. Loyalty sales represented approximately two-thirds of its U.S. sales since launch.
The biggest news of the year, however, related to executive changes. In May, Andrew M. Meslow stepped down as CEO due to health reasons. He was succeeded by Sarah E. Nash as interim CEO until December, when Gina Boswell, a former Unilever executive, was named CEO.
In August 2022, the company revealed that it had eliminated about 130 roles, the majority of which were leadership positions as it pursued “a number of initiatives to improve financial performance and better position the organization for long-term growth.”
Most recently, Daniel Loeb’s Third Point fund, which owns a 6% stake in Bath &amp; Body Works, called for shareholder representation on the board to ease concerns about the company’s corporate governance and decision-making processes. Bath &amp; Body Work’s board of directors has slammed activist investor Third Point’s proxy challenge as “misguided,” suggesting that it is because the retailer rejected Third Point’s “ultimatum” that it appoint a former employee of the hedge fund to its board.

Cosmetics sales Europe: ¥24.4 billion, +7.5% (+0.4%)
Many factors weighed on Kao’s results in 2022, including lockdowns and a cooling market in China, logistics disruption in the U.S., and global inflation, driving consumers toward lower priced products. Kao worked to concentrate investment in core brands, push digital and implement strategic price increases to counterbalance a challenging context.
In December, the group announced leadership changes for its Cosmetics business unit. As of Jan. 1 this year, Yosuke Maezawa took over management of the activity globally. President of Kao’s prestige cosmetics business, he takes on the titles of senior executive officer of the global cosmetics business and becomes president and representative director of Kanebo Cosmetics Inc. and chairperson for Molton Brown. Mark Johnson, previously head of Molton Brown, is now president of its cosmetics business in the Americas and Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
For the Cosmetics business, sales overall were up last year thanks to a gradual market recovery at home and the company’s strategy of concentrating on its 11 biggest brands, including Kanebo prestige skin care and makeup and Kate makeup. Under the latter, Lip Monster did well. Kao said it had made advances during the year toward reducing fixed costs and implementing structural reforms for its makeup business.
Chinese sales for the division declined not just because of lockdowns and an overall market slowdown — Kao said the rise of local manufacturers and changes to distribution channels also substantially impacted its business there.
European cosmetics sales were flat, attributed to inflationary pressure on consumers, although it said both Sensai and Molton Brown had gained market share.
Within the Health and Beauty Care business, skin care sales were up, boosted by sun products and other seasonal products due to a hot summer at home. Category sales in the U.S. declined, however, due to inflationary pressure.
Hair care sales were down, although Kao noted that high-end brand Oribe remained strong thanks to growth online and in its core salon channel. Domestic mass-market hair care sales fell, and the company said it had begun a fundamental business transformation for the category in the fiercely competitive segment. Profitability decreased significantly due in large part to inflationary pressure on raw materials.
Key initiatives included a new brand for Gen Z men dubbed Unclics, which launched online in December with a makeup base and lotion, with five serums added to the lineup this January. It announced plans to transform its Toyohashi manufacturing plant, which mainly makes skin and hair care products, into an integrated supply chain base using robots and AI to navigate fluctuation in demand and Japan’s shrinking workforce. It also joined U.S.-based biotech firm Genomatica’s venture to scale and commercialize more sustainable, plant-based alternatives to palm oil. Unilever is also a founding member of that venture.

International skin health/beauty sales: $2 billion, -5.9% vs. 2021
Top markets: U.S., China.
Johnson &amp; Johnson announced its plans to carve out its Consumer Health business in 2021, and that effort is still underway. In May of 2022, the company named Thibaut Mongon and Paul Ruh as its designate CEO and CFO, respectively. As announced last year, that company will be called Kenvue. It is expected to launch in 2023.
Supply constraints hindered growth in the skin health and beauty division last year, but those losses were partially offset by successful launches in Asia Pacific and Latin America. China sales also took a hit given COVID-19-related constraints.
The company told investors after the third quarter that overseas markets had grown, driven by product innovation from Neutrogena and Aveeno.
In the U.S., according to data from IRI, Neutrogena’s concealer sales in the mass market channel grew 26.8% last year. Moisturizers and antiaging treatments fell double and single-digits, respectively. For the year, it held its top spot in makeup removers. Aveeno’s cleansers, moisturizers and lotions all reaped single-digit gains.
For the last quarter, Neutrogena performed well in both club and e-commerce channels, according to the company, and Consumer Health overall grew double-digits for that time period.
In the skin health and beauty portfolio, key initiatives addressed the science of skin care with forays into the metaverse and several takes at addressing skin health equity, such as increasing the number of dermatologists from minority groups and raising awareness around chronic diseases among Black consumers.

KEY FINANCIALS:
Beauty Care division preliminary sales: €3.78 billion, +2.6% vs. 2021 (organic sales -0.5%)
Beauty Care division adjusted operating profit: €296 million, -15.7%
Preliminary group sales: €22.4 billion, +11.6%
Henkel advanced with its restructuring, merging its Beauty Care and Laundry &amp; Home Care business into a single Consumer Brands business unit ahead of schedule. The merger is expected to deliver €500 million in synergies and €250 million in savings by the end of 2023. The major revamp includes divesting and discontinuing operations with combined sales of €1 billion across Henkel’s portfolio. Within the consumer beauty portfolio, activities representing around €200 million were discontinued last year, Henkel said, without going into specifics.
Other levers include optimizing supply chain across the business, reducing expenses through combined scale and R&amp;D synergies — for example with joint innovation between the hair care and laundry activities.
In April 2022, Henkel said it would be exiting Russia.
Henkel’s Beauty Care sales for the year grew 2.6% in reported terms, to €3.78 billion, but increases were mainly driven by inflation, and on an organic level, revenues were up a fractional 0.5%; volumes actually dropped 9.4%. The business did well in North America and Western Europe, and saw double-digit growth in emerging markets with the exception of Asia Pacific, severely impacted by pandemic containment measures in China. In the mass market, which accounts for around two-thirds of Henkel’s beauty sales, hairstyling gained double digits organically, but hair color was negative as demand normalized after the pandemic. Body care was also down, attributed to the portfolio optimization measures. Henkel’s sales in the professional segment, however, grew strongly, driven by double-digit organic gains in emerging markets.
Key initiatives for its brands included Schwarzkopf Professional’s collaboration with start-up The Unseen to introduce what it claims is the world’s first prismatic, holographic hair color that reacts to temperature, dubbed Colour Alchemy. The temporary color needs no pre-lightning or bleaching. Authentic Beauty Concept implemented a new version of its in-salon Refill Bar.
In October, Henkel announced the launch of the first business-to-business-to-consumer hyper-personalized professional hair care brand, SalonLab&amp;Me, based on hair analysis by the stylist with a tailored device combined with a dedicated online sales platform linked to the specific salon. As well as suggesting a personalized bundle of products, consumers can customize their labels and preferred fragrance.
16.PUIG
BARCELONA, SPAIN
2022 BEAUTY SALES:
$3.52 BILLION (EST.)
€3.34 BILLION (EST.)
+40% vs. 2021 (EST.)
MAIN BRANDS: Paco Rabanne, Carolina Herrera, Jean Paul Gaultier, Nina Ricci, Charlotte Tilbury, Byredo, Penhaligon’s, L’Artisan Parfumeur, Christian Louboutin, Comme des Garçons Parfums, Kama Ayurveda, Loto del Sur, Uriage, Apivita, Antonio Banderas, Shakira, United Colors of Benetton, Adolfo Dominguez.
KEY FINANCIALS:
Main markets: The U.S., U.K. and Spain combined accounted for 36% of estimated beauty sales.
Puig’s business was on fire in 2022, when its strength in artisanal and prestige fragrances — accentuated by the acquisition of Byredo from Manzanita Capital during the year — and strong growth from Charlotte Tilbury drove a 40% gain in sales overall. As such, the family owned Spanish company surpassed its 2023 sales target of €3 billion a year ahead of schedule. 
The strongest growth came from the Americas. The U.S. has been Puig’s largest market since 2021.
Puig grew above the market average in all three of the core beauty categories, reportedly capturing market share. While high-end fragrance and makeup were the biggest drivers, it also saw growth in dermo-cosmetics after shifting its corporate structure in 2020 to better represent  and tap into distinct categories.
In May, Puig acquired a majority stake in Byredo, the high-end brand created by Ben Gorham in 2006 which is said do to more than $100 million in annual sales. It had been owned by London-based Manzanita, which retains a minority stake, since 2013. Gorham stayed on as chief creative officer.
Puig also upped its stakes in Colombian natural cosmetics brand Loto del Sur and Indian beauty and wellness brand Kama Ayurveda, becoming majority owner of both after investing in minority stakes in separate deals in 2019.
Major launches included Fame from Paco Rabanne, a sister for Phantom, introduced a year earlier, intended to herald a new era for the label’s women’s scents, more aligned with the fashion brand, which Puig also owns.
In January 2023, former Puig executive Fernando Aleu passed away at 93. He is credited with building the company’s business Stateside starting in the 1960s, contributing to the success of Paco Rabanne and inking Puig’s long-standing relationship with Carolina Herrera.
17.COLGATE-PALMOLIVE
NEW YORK
2022 BEAUTY SALES:
$3.41 BILLION (EST.)
-2% vs. 2021 (EST.)
MAIN BRANDS: Palmolive, Speed Stick, Sanex, Protex, Caprice, Lady Speed Stick, Softsoap, Irish Spring, Tom’s of Maine (deodorant, skin care, lip care), PCA Skin, EltaMD (professional skin care), Laboratoires Filorga Cosmétiques.  
KEY FINANCIALS:
Total company sales: $17.97 billion, +3.2%
Oral, Personal Care and Home Care sales: : $14.25 billion, +1.0%
Oral, Personal and Home Care sales by region:
North America: $3.82 billion, +3.5%
Latin America: $4.0 billion, +9.3%
Europe: $2.55 billion, -10.2%
Asia Pacific: $2.83 billion, -1.1%
Africa Eurasia: $1.08 billion, +2.9%
Despite a slight decline in its estimated beauty sales overall, price hikes across many of its categories drove sales increases in key areas for Colgate-Palmolive. Personal care sales grew, the company said, but skin care sales declined organically. But signs suggest the company’s deeper move into the highly profitable professional beauty industry with EltaMD and PCA Skin (which were purchased in 2017) is paying off. It saw overall sales gains for its oral, personal and home care activities in the North America, Latin America and African Eurasian regions, although numbers were down in Europe and Asia Pacific. Efforts to shore up online sales also boosted business, with e-commerce sales expanding double digits in 2022.
Colgate unleashed a slew of new items including an expanded array of sunscreens in new forms under the EltaMD Skincare range. Its UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 was reportedly the bestselling prestige skin care product in the U.S. thanks to a formula that doesn’t exacerbate acne-prone skin and is infused with ingredients like niacinamide. The product received a boost from exposure on social media, especially TikTok.
EltaMD, which is sold primarily through dermatologists’ offices, spas and on Amazon, leveraged its popularity in sun care to expand beyond its core range. In addition, Colgate broadened its professional products in the PCA portfolio, including the Brighten: Therapeutic Blackberry Mask and a host of new facial peels. Laboratories Filorga rolled out new advanced eye treatments, such as Time-Filler Eyes 5XP, which features five inspirations from aesthetic medicine techniques and targets five separate eye zones.
The company has undertaken major restructuring and upskilling programs. In January 2022, it launched a Global Productivity Initiative, designed to allocate resources more effectively to growth areas, drive efficiencies in operations and streamline the supply chain. The upskilling initiative is intended to improve digital and data skills.

Domestic beauty sales: KRW 2.81 trillion, -19.4%
Beauty sales in the rest of Asia: KRW 1.29 trillion, -23.7%
Beauty sales in North America: KRW 181.4 billion, +83.4%
It was a tough year for South Korea’s beauty leaders. With a slightly lesser sales decline than its biggest competitor LG Household &amp; Health Care, Amorepacific returned to the top spot among the country’s cosmetics players by a margin. But it continued to be hampered by lackluster demand at home and was heavily impacted by sales declines in China, which had been a key market for its international expansion and accounted for 60% of its sales in Asia outside of its home market. Outside Asia, the company succeeded in accelerating.
North America was a particular area of focus, and its sales increased 83% thanks to the growth of Sulwhasoo, Innisfree and Laneige, which was a bestseller on Amazon Prime Day. The company acquired clean beauty brand Tata Harper, with plans to expand it internationally and enhance its profitability by leveraging scale and streamlining processes.
Europe also grew well, with sales up 37% thanks largely to Laneige. The company launched in Japanese retail and saw strong performance for Sulwhasoo and Laneige in ASEAN countries.
In December, Kim Seunghwan was named president of subsidiary Amorepacific Corp, which houses the majority of the group’s beauty operations and its business. He had been CEO of parent company Amorepacific Group since 2021, charged with reviewing the fundamentals of the business in an unfavorable context. He is now charged with accelerating the unit’s global expansion and tapping new opportunities. Lee Sangmok, a former vice president at Amorepacific Group, took over as president there.
The firm worked to accelerate its shift online, expanding partnerships with e-commerce platforms and enhancing digital marketing. One focus was Amore Mall, Amorepacific’s multibrand online platform, and another was partnering with influencers to enhance brand awareness among Millennials and Gen Z. This resulted in growth in domestic sales online. Core brand Innisfree increased e-commerce sales and returned to operating profit. Etude grew in multibrand shops and online, and also returned to profit thanks to an improved channel mix and a decrease in fixed costs, according to the company. Domestic travel-retail sales, which accounted for 22% of total revenues in South Korea, saw double-digit declines.
Strengthening the identity of key brands and their star products continued to be a focus. Laneige introduced the Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic line and personalized services. Its Lip Sleeping Mask did particularly well in North America. Makeup brand Espoir and hair care line Amos Professional grew sales.

It was a tough year for LG Household &amp; Health Care in the beauty space, hampered by sluggish demand at home and abroad. Travel retail and China, both of which have been key factors in the company’s growth in recent years, were particularly hard hit. Beauty Division sales in travel retail fell 43% year-on-year. In the fourth quarter, LG H&amp;H reported a net loss of KRW 108.8 billion, its first quarterly deficit in 18 years.
Cha Suk-yong, who had led LG H&amp;H for 18 years, stepped down “to clear the way for younger generations,” according to the company. In December, Le Jung-ae, most recently head of the company’s refreshment business, took over as president and CEO, the company’s first female CEO — and one of very few among the Top 100 beauty firms. Having also previously led its household goods and luxury cosmetics activity, she is seen as having the understanding of the overall business and organization to lead it into the future.
Strategic priorities for LG H&amp;Hinclude continuing to grow its business Stateside — seen as a major opportunity thanks to the ongoing K-pop wave — and reducing its international operations’ dependence on China.
In June, LG H&amp;H signed a deal to acquire a 65% stake in U.S.-based The Crème Shop for $121 million. The U.S.-based K-Beauty brand targets younger consumers through collaborations with characters from Hello Kitty, Disney and BT21. LG plans to foster its U.S. business thanks to the acquisition. The purchase follows the 2019 acquisition of New Avon and in 2021, that of Boinca, best known for its Arctic Fox hair coloring line.
In terms of 2022 sales, LG’s core brand in the luxury space, The History of Whoo, posted a 38% year-on-year sales decline. O Hui did well, however, gaining 17%.
For the Daily Beauty activity, inflation and more price-sensitive consumers hindered growth, and profitability was impacted by prices, exchange rates and wages. Nevertheless, the company said it continued to invest in premium brand marketing for the division. Veilment body care grew 22% year-on-year, and dermocosmetics brand Physiogel gained 17%.
20. KOSÉ CORP.

2022 BEAUTY SALES:
$2.21 BILLION (EST.)
¥289.14 BILLION (EST.)

KEY FINANCIALS:
(Based on restated numbers for 2021 to account for the change in Kosé’s fiscal year end to December)
Company net sales: ¥289.14 billion, +7.5%
Operating Profit: ¥22.12 billion, +41.1%
Cosmetics sales: ¥234.97 billion, +7.9%
Cosmetaries sales: ¥52.23 billion, +6.2%
Japan sales: ¥163.04 billion, +7.3%
Rest of Asia: ¥80.79 billion, +0.5%
North America: ¥40.14 billion, +22.7%
Other: ¥5.17 billion, +32%
An uptick in the Japanese economy, increased sales of its premium products — notably the Decorté and Albion brands — in department stores and specialty stores at home, and brisk business for Tarte in the U.S. and Europe, meant it was a strong year overall for Kosé.
The Japanese player outpaced its internal growth forecasts, notably thanks to better-than-expected sales in the latter part of the year. This was despite the impact of lockdowns in China and a decline in sales in South Korea, it said.
In China, sales were sluggish, but the yen’s devaluation meant a slight uptick for sales in reported terms. Kosé said its travel-retail sales in China remained strong, picking up in the second half as travel restrictions were lifted on Hainan Island. South Korean travel-retail business suffered from the absence of Chinese travelers there.
On the domestic market, recovery in demand for makeup drove Jill Stuart and Addiction. Despite sluggish demand for prestige skin care in Japanese drugstores, Kosé said it increased its market share in the sensitive skin care market.
In the U.S., Tarte maintained its prestige makeup market share, strengthening its lineup in concealers, mascara and other key categories. Increased distribution and currency effects led to increased sales in reported terms. Tarte also drove gains in European sales — notably thanks to the launch of Sephora’s U.K. business from October. Overall, the brand’s bestsellers and new product introductions did well, and Tarte grew its sales by 27.1%, although the brand’s operating profit declined.
For the Cosmetaries business, sales of Bioliss hair care were sluggish, but Clear Turn and Stephen Knoll New York grew, meaning an uptick in revenues for the division overall.
Kosé also improved its profitability significantly, thanks to cost control and inventory reduction, mainly in China, despite the inflation of raw material prices and the weak yen.

The Sundance Film Festival has announced the lineup for its 40th edition, which will take place in Park City, Utah, from Jan. 18–28. The program includes Christopher Reeve doc “Super/Man,” two films apiece from indie darlings Kristen Stewart and Jesse Eisenberg, plus fresh projects from a handful of directors who launched their careers at Sundance years ago.
The veteran contingent includes Richard Linklater (who’ll bring both “Hit Man” and an episode of the “God Bless Texas” anthology series), the Zellner Brothers (whose starry “Sasquatch Sunset” winks to their low-budget 2011 Sundance short “Sasquatch Birth Journal 2”) and Steven Soderbergh (set to premiere his new thriller, “Presence,” 35 years after “Sex, Lies, and Videotape”).
Also on hand will be director Christopher Nolan, set to collect the inaugural Sundance Institute Trailblazer Award, an honor meant to boost his award-season profile while reminding the world that the “Oppenheimer” helmer brought “Memento” to Park City, Utah, way back in 2001. Also returning are “Half Nelson” directors Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden, whose latest, the late-’80s Oakland-set “Freaky Tales” (starring Pedro Pascal), marks a return to their indie-film roots after their stint in the comic book realm with 2019’s “Captain Marvel.”
As always, the emphasis is on discovery, as 40 of the 101 feature directors screening work at Sundance next year are first-timers. That’s 101 directors, but just 82 films, as the festival program is shaping up to be slightly smaller this year — back to the scale of its pandemic-impacted 2022 edition.
Sundance introduced an online streaming platform in 2021 and will be sticking to the hybrid format first implemented last January, while crafting the schedule so as to encourage maximum in-person engagement.
Engaging directly with the public is a major priority for incoming festival director Eugene Hernandez, formerly of the New York Film Festival. “We’re really thinking a lot about how to give each film the best possible first impression. And it’s really that success over that first weekend, when audiences see these films in the room that really sets the stage for what will happen for awards [and distribution] down the line. But before we get there, these films have to land with audiences and critics and curators and buyers,” Hernandez explains, “so we’re really doubling down on that this year. The first few days are really about creating an opportunity for that in-person communal kind of experience to happen.”
To boost the energy of those first screenings, Sundance is doing away with the idea of an opening film — or even the half-dozen or so “day one” screenings given special weight in recent years. Instead, the festival will start earlier in the day on Thursday, Jan. 18, with nearly 20 movies debuting that afternoon and evening (reason for many to book their flights the day before). All of the films in competition, plus a small number from other sections, will be available to the public online starting the following Thursday, Jan. 25. 
“We know that internationally, people are not traveling as much, budgets are tight, so we want to make it as inclusive an experience as possible,” says Sundance Institute CEO Joana Vicente, who warns, “There’s limited capacity, so people should be buying those tickets in advance.”
For her part, Sundance director of programming Kim Yutani is encouraged by “all the exciting, distinctive new films that that will be launching this January.” The festival received a record 17,435 submissions from 153 countries or territories, 4,410 of them features. “We never quite know what to expect at the beginning of every programming season,” she says.
While the dual writers and actors strikes last summer certainly proved disruptive to the industry, Yutani’s team found some films — such as Sean Wang’s “Didi,” and “Ghostlight” from “Saint Frances” duo Kelly O’Sullivan and Alex Thompson — that had been completed with interim agreements.
“We have artists in our sphere who are just undeterred by whatever obstacles are put in their way,” Kutani says. “That is such an encouraging part of this year’s festival, to see the bold creativity that has been happening over this past year. It seemed like our submissions were not affected by what happened in the summer.”
Among the films selected, Yutani expects the documentary “Super/Man: The Christopher Reeve Story” (which will kick off the parallel Salt Lake City portion of the festival) to be a breakout. Kristen Stewart’s two films are “Love Lies Bleeding” (from “Saint Maud” director Rose Glass) and “Love Me” (from promising newcomers Sam and Andy Zuchero, recipients of the festival’s science-centric Alfred P. Sloan Feature Film Prize). Jesse Eisenberg wrote, directed and stars in “A Real Pain,” in addition to acting in the Zellners’ latest. Chiwetel Ejiofor also appears on both sides of the camera in his film, “Rob Peace,” about an unlikely drug dealer.
In the festival’s U.S. Dramatic Competition section, many of the films — including Laura Chinn’s “Suncoast” and “Stress Positions” with John Early — feature largely unknown ensembles, but seem poised to launch acting careers. Others cast familiar faces in a new light. For example, Nathan Silver’s “Between the Temples” gives Carol Kane a late-career starring role, while visual artist Titus Kaphar’s “Exhibiting Forgiveness” offers showcase roles to André Holland, Andra Day and Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor.
“A lot of the films feel very personal and intimate,” Yutani says, citing “Good One,” “In the Summers” and “Didi,” while searching for a common thread within a diverse lineup.
The programming team strives to find a broad range of voices and stories. This year, they wound up with a nearly 50/50 gender ratio: 37 of the 82 features were directed by filmmakers who identify as women (whereas just 30% of the submissions can say as much). Five of the directors are transgender. 
More than 80% of the films are seeking distribution. Buzzy acquisition titles include Fleck and Boden’s “Freaky Tales” and SXSW winner Megan Park’s “My Old Ass,” starring Aubrey Plaza. (Incidentally, all three filmmakers were former Variety Directors to Watch, as was “Ponyboi” helmer Esteban Arango.) Susanna Fogel returns a year after “Cat Person” with “Winner,” starring Emilia Jones as Reality Winner. On the doc side, “Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar” director Josh Greenbaum unveils real-life road-trip “Will &amp; Harper,” featuring Will Ferrell … and a twist.
“At the end of the day, we’re looking for films that are really going to connect with audiences,” Yutani says. “One of the most gratifying parts of putting together this festival is seeing the films that pop in unexpected ways.”
The short film selections and 40th edition programming for the 2024 Sundance Film Festival will be announced on Dec. 12.
