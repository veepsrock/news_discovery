Catherine Osborn,Latin American Start-Ups Make Their Pitch,"From fintech to AI, investors are enthusiastic about the region’s growth potential.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/04/19/latin-america-start-ups-web-summit-rio-fintech-ai-climate/,https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Web-Summit-Rio-startups-tech-Latin-America-Brazil-GettyImages-2147861948.jpg?w=1000,2024-04-19T12:00:33Z,"Welcome back to Foreign Policys Latin America Brief.Welcome back to Foreign Policys Latin America Brief.
The highlights this week: We dive deep into the regions economics, visiting a tech summit in Brazil, examining the U.S. sanctions snapback on Venezuela, and gaining insights from a father of the World Trade Organization.
Around 34,000 people from more than 100 countries descended on Rio de Janeiro this week for the second Web Summit Rio. The event, which highlights Latin Americas start-up scene, has quickly become the regions largest tech conference. Investors listened to new companies from Mexico to Chile pitch products and services. Last month, another start-up conference in the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre drew more than 23,000 people.
The high attendance reflects broad enthusiasm about Latin Americas start-up scene. It has come a long way in the last decade, said investor Rodrigo Baer of Upload Ventures, speaking at a Web Summit Rio session. When I started investing, we wanted to hire a marketing manager for [food delivery app] iFood and there wasnt one. Nobody had been a marketing manager for a start-up in 2012, he said.
Now, dozens of start-ups in the region have grown to be worth over a billion dollars each, in part driven by a boost during the COVID-19 pandemic. People became increasingly reliant on technology to work, access health care, and receive pandemic stimulus money. When central banks lowered interest rates to get the economy moving again in 2021, optimistic investors doled out record amounts of money to regional start-ups.
Now, investment levels are back down to pre-pandemic levels. But the start-up environment has matured, Buenos Aires-based venture capital investor Claire Díaz-Ortiz said at the summit. You see more early-stage funding happening than a couple of years ago, she said. New investor-led accelerator programs for founders include mentoring as well as financial support.
Latin Americas largest tech start-ups are concentrated in the financial sector, such as Brazils Nubank and Mexicos Bitso. Many people in the region lack conventional bank accounts but have smartphones. So-called fintechs have capitalized on this mismatch; in 2023, they continued to attract more money than any other start-up category, according to the Association for Private Capital Investment in Latin America.
Other start-up categories with high fundraising numbers reflect current economic trends, including logistics tech start-ups, which seek to take advantage of companies aiming to nearshore supply chains in Latin America. Representatives from Brazil-based cargo airline and logistics firm Modern Logistics were at the Rio conference, scouting out possible partners and vendors, and seeing how we can collaborate, CEO Cristiano Koga said. 
Climate tech companies have also attracted increased funding. Web Summit attendees included the founders of Vammo, an electric motorcycle service for delivery workers operating in São Paulo, and Órigo Energy, a Brazilian firm that offers discounts on electricity bills for customers who switch to solar power.
Artificial intelligence featured in many companies plans, too. Brazil- and U.S.-based start-up Traive uses algorithms that model the financial risk of agriculture firms based on more than 2,500 data inputs such as crop type, vehicle usage, and local climate. Its method was recently used to create sustainable bonds for deforestation-free soy from Brazils Cerrado region.
Start-ups have the potential to make Latin Americas business environment more competitive, and their ability to do so often depends on countries regulatory environments. But many start-ups are also shaping government regulations themselves.
Solar installation in Brazil has risen since Órigo Energy and its industry peers successfully pushed for rules on the sector. The change gave legal security and predictability for investments, CEO Surya Mendonça said. A large session at the summit was devoted to how G-20 countries can adopt policies that facilitate healthy environments for start-ups.
Argentinas representative to that session, tech entrepreneur Hanna Schiuma, said that some central banks in the region, such as in Colombia and Brazil, have supported the fintech landscape by running tests of regulations that could be appropriate for new types of financial products. Brazils work on digital innovation was applauded last month by the publication Central Banking, which named it Central Bank of the Year.
Schiuma acknowledged that the current economic uncertainty in Argentina had generally made business planning more difficult at the moment. The dust has not yet settled on President Javier Mileis sweeping economic policy overhaul. But taken as a whole, we are in a moment of clear growth of the start-up ecosystem in the region, she said.

Venezuela sanctions snapback. True to its warnings, the United States announced the reimposition of broad oil and gas sanctions on Venezuela on Wednesday after a six-month hiatus, citing Caracass failure to meet commitments on conditions for July presidential elections. U.S. officials cited bans on opposition candidates and their substitutes as sticking points.
U.S. oil firms will not face total restrictions on operating in the country, however. Chevron can still drill in Venezuela under permission that was granted separately from the October sanctions relief. The U.S. Treasury Department encouraged other oil companies to apply for similar permission.
Whether or not the temporary U.S. sanctions relief on Venezuela was successful depends on whom you ask. Advocates of a maximum pressure strategy argue sanctions should have never been retracted, while others point out that the negotiations that secured sanctions relief led to the release of U.S. and Venezuelan prisoners in the country and spurred the presidential primary process within Venezuelas opposition.
Haitis transition team. After weeks of haggling, Haiti has named a transitional government that includes representatives from civil society, several political parties, and the countrys interfaith religious community. The body was announced on Tuesday and has seven voting members and two nonvoting members. Acting Prime Minister Ariel Henry is expected to step down once the council is installed, although no date was immediately announced.
The difficulties Haiti faced identifying members of the transition team suggests another delay may be in store as they select a new prime minister. Were wishing them success, but this does not look like a clear path. It looks very murky, very uncertain, the Miami Heralds Caribbean correspondent, Jacqueline Charles, told FPs Ravi Agrawal in an interview last week.

Conservation mystery. As Venezuelas political future hangs in the balance, so, too, does the fate of its sea turtle populations. Over the past year, conservationists in La Sabana, a town on the countrys coast that is home to four of the seven sea turtle species on Earth, noticed that many of the reptiles were dying.
The conservationists were unable to discover the silent killer until Washington Post reporter Ana Vanessa Herrero began to research the problem. Herrero spoke to experts elsewhere in Venezuela who were studying an invasive species of ocean grass known as beach cabbage or sea lettuce. She relayed information about the plant to the conservationists in La Sabana, who have attempted to control its growth.
Venezuelan environmental officials have been informed about the invasive species and said they would work to eradicate it. But local activists said no work had begun as of early this month. After residents own beach cabbage management efforts, La Sabana is eagerly awaiting sea turtles who will again lay eggs on its shores, the Washington Post reports.

Latin American officials are in Washington this week for the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) spring meetings. Those bodies are weighing proposals to address debt pressure on poor countries and to increase climate finance on a global level. Brazilian Finance Minister Fernando Haddad on Wednesday led a call for a new tax on the super-rich to fund the green transition.
The meetings also weighed the IMFs latest predictions about the direction of the world economy. Although its worst fears of post-pandemic stagflation have not come to pass, the fund said global growth is still well below its potential. Many low-income countries remain debt-saddled, and ongoing wars could interrupt trade.
The IMF also said that geoeconomic fragmentation was stifling growth, a reference to trends that include Western efforts to put space between them and the Russian and Chinese economies. The fund noted that dividing the world into geoeconomic blocs could reduce capital and knowledge flows significantly and suppress growth, adding that multilateral cooperation is needed.
Beyond the IMF, veterans of the global trade system are more candidly sounding alarms. Current and former Latin American officials, including Haddad, have voiced wariness about geoeconomic clubs in recent months, both publicly and in private policy meetings.
[I]t is a misstep for the U.S., as a global leader, to restrict market openness and promote the onshoring of production, former Uruguayan central banker and former Inter-American Development Bank President Enrique Iglesias argued last month in an interview with a policy researcher that was shared with Foreign Policy.
Iglesias was a protagonist in talks that led to the founding of the World Trade Organization in the 1990s. It was a period of optimism about the rules for the global economy. [N]ow I wonder if it was too good to be true, he said.
This concept of friendshoring goes against capitalism, delving into ideological control. It appears as though the leading superpower is acting from a position of fear, almost akin to that of a smaller nation. What underpins this fear of competition within the United States?",,Foreign Policy,High-Quality News Sources
Catherine Osborn,Is Western Pessimism on Latin America Overblown?,A new report debunks common narratives about the region’s stagnation.,https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/02/16/latin-america-economics-democracy-west-report-nearshoring-china/,https://foreignpolicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Arevalo-Borrel-EU-Guatemala-GettyImages-1923335492.jpg?w=1000,2024-02-16T13:00:35Z,"Welcome back to Foreign Policys Latin America Brief.Welcome back to Foreign Policys Latin America Brief.
The highlights this week: Researchers seek to correct misconceptions about Latin Americas economic outlook, Russia cuts down on Ecuadorianbanana imports, and generative AI reveals the U.S. role in weapons flows to Mexico.
On Monday, a group that included a senior Spanish diplomat; scholars from Latin America, the United States, and Spain; and current and former officials from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund gathered at Georgetown University in Washington for a seminar provocatively titled Why Does Latin America Matter?
Its a question that Spain has prioritized over the past 18 months. Last year, Madrid used its authority as president of the Council of the European Union to organize a summit between the European Union and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States. Spain was also a vocal advocate for concluding the EU-Mercosur trade deal in months of intense but ultimately unfruitful talks.
Researchers from the Elcano Royal Institute, a think tank funded in part by the Spanish government, compiled the report that was the centerpiece of Mondays event and was also presented to Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez. The researchers conducted more than eight months of interviews with European think tanks, business leaders, politicians, and academics, asking broad questions about their perceptions of the region, said Elcanos José Juan Ruiz, one of the lead authors of the study.
Ruizs team was concerned by the responses they received. Once we started this debate, we could not stop, because it was so misguided, he said. What most of these different interest groups in Europe think about Latin America is very clear, he continued, citing a list of those impressions: Democracy is weak. The region is an economic disaster. China is the new hegemon. And companies that invested in Latin America in the 1990s amid an economic opening destroyed value for their shareholders.
The Spanish research group dug through data and concluded that these claims were generally overblown, if not outright false, Ruiz said. He argued that for European companies and firms, intensifying ties with Latin America made geopolitical and business sense. The report found that the portion of the worlds debt and financial crises that occurred in Latin America dropped significantly in the last two decades compared with the three previous decades. On governance, the countries in the region are generally democracies.
Writing off the region is really very costly, said Ruiz, an economist and former Spanish government official.
Although trade between China and South America is high, the total investment stock of U.S. and EU firms in Latin America is 20 times that of Chinese firms, the study noted. And European and U.S. firms buy more of what the study called high value-added South American exports than do Chinese companiespurchasing machine parts instead of soybeans, for example. High-value goods are an export class that Latin American countries want to grow.
At the United Nations, Latin American nations usually vote with the West on resolutions regarding democracy, human rights, and territorial integrity. This sets the region apart from most other developing regions and aligns it more closely with EU foreign-policy positions than many of the Eastern European countries vying for EU membership, former Uruguayan Foreign Minister Ernesto Talvi, another lead author of the study, said at the Monday event.
Finally, when it comes to the ability for foreign companies to make money, the paper found that Spanish firms see a net return of 4.8 percent per year in Latin America, compared with 3.5 percent for equivalent investments in the developed world. Thats why they are largely reinvesting their earnings in the region.
The Elcano report provides data-based assurances that so-called friendshoring to Latin America can make business sense. More broadly, it offers a glass-half-full take on the regions current trajectory. The research adds to many of the points made by Americas Quarterlys Brian Winter in an essay last October laying out a relatively bullish case for doing business in the region.
Mondays event included two panels to debate the merits of the Elcano report. Some panelists quibbled that a fair-stock take of the region should include more information on shortcomings such as low-quality education and organized crime. But many attendees also voiced comments such as that of the Brookings Institutions Santiago Levy, a former Mexican official and former vice president of the Inter-American Development Bank.
Its refreshing and forces you to think, Levy said. Its always good if you have somebody from the outside who is a friend, and I mean Spain. They take a cold look at the region from the outside, and you say, Look, guys. You can do it.

Russias banana ban. Russia said this month that it would suspend purchases from some Ecuadorian banana exporters following a deal in which Ecuador agreed to supply the United States with military parts. The United States has said those parts would be shipped to Ukraine. Russias banana ban is significant. Bananas are a major Ecuadorian export; until now, around 98 percent of bananas arriving in Russia from overseas came from Ecuador.
The U.S.-Ecuador deal represents rare arms support to Ukraine from Latin America and Caribbean countries, which have generally shunned U.S. requests for military aid to Kyiv. But center-right Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa has signaled he hopes to improve Quitos relations with Washington and is committing tosecurity cooperation with the United States to address a domestic crime wave.   
The Wall Street view on Caracas. Wall Street traders who deal in government-issued debt played a role in lobbying the U.S. government for its October 2023 move to lift sanctions on Venezuela, the Wall Street Journal reported this week. The traders observed that U.S. sanctions had pushed Venezuela to intensify financial ties with Russia via debt markets and alerted U.S. officials.
Even if Washington reimposes most of its sanctions on Caracas this year due to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduros noncompliance with U.S. expectations for free and fair elections, government debt markets might remain untouched, the Journal reported. Such a sanctions snapback appeared even more likely this week after news broke on Tuesday that the Maduro administration had imprisoned a prominent human rights researcher, Rocío San Miguel.

Brazils balloon bandits. Of the illicit activities that occur in Rio de Janeiro, hot air ballooning is less known to outsiders. But residents of the city and surrounding suburbs are used to seeing hot air balloons streak the sky despite a decades-old ban. The Guardian reported this week on the law-flouting Brazilians who engage in the practiceand have, on some occasions, launched 10-story-high balloons or loaded balloons with fireworks. Practitioners of large-scale ballooning call it gigantismo, or gigantism.

Generative artificial intelligence may help reveal cross-border flows of arms to criminal groups in Latin America. For years, researchers who study arms flows in the region have used photos of weapons uploaded to social media to pinpoint details about where guns were originally manufactured. But AI allows researchers to scour much more open-source data on the internet.
Andrei Serbin Pont, the president of the Regional Coordinator of Economic and Social Research (CRIES), a Latin American think tank, wrote in Bellingcat last week that AI has given researchers from CRIES and Florida International University stronger capabilities to process open-source data. Members of his team upload their findings to a platform they run on the so-called small arms and light weapons trade in the region (i.e., handguns rather than tanks).
The platforms data appeared to reinforce an assertion from Mexico that U.S.-manufactured guns are flooding into the country and being used in criminal violence. Mexicos government has sued U.S. gunmakers in a lawsuit that was revived by a U.S. appeals court last month. The suit claims that U.S. gunmakers abet weapons illegal use by Mexican cartels.
Dangerous weapons dont just end up in the hands of criminal cartels, Mexican journalist Chantal Flores wrote in an article co-published by Foreign Policy and the Dial last year, adding that Mexico only has one legal gun store. Much of this trafficking is done by people with dual citizenship or Americans hired by drug cartels.
The AI-enhanced data platform has also revealed concerning trends elsewhere in the region, such as the apparent use of Peruvian army grenades by Ecuadorian criminal groups.",,Foreign Policy,High-Quality News Sources

DRIVING THE DAY
NEW JMART COLUMN Jonathan Martin goes inside the RON DeSANTIS campaign in Tallahassee and brings back this scoop-studded report:
Gathered around a conference table at the Florida Republican Partys headquarters here late last month, Gov. Ron DeSantiss inner circle did little to hide their eagerness to get into the presidential race or mask their frustration over the rising skepticism about their candidate-in-waiting 
[T]he aides working for the former Yale baseball player dont want their phenom to be judged before he even steps into the batter box, to stretch the metaphor. Thats why they invited me to Tallahassee.
DeSantiss high command recognizes that the catnip-for-junkies national polling has shifted toward [DONALD] TRUMP this year, but they believe they retain a fundamental advantage. The majority of the Republican Party wants to move on, said GENERRA PECK, DeSantiss campaign manager and closest aide.
BIDEN BRACES FOR TITLE 42 BACKLASH Title 42 ended at midnight. For more than two years, immigrant rights advocates have been pressuring President JOE BIDEN to undo the Trump-era pandemic policy that allowed the federal government to send asylum seekers back to Mexico. (Previously, asylum seekers who crossed the southern border illegally could wait in the U.S. while their cases were pending.)
With the Covid emergency now officially over, theres no justification for the policy. But its demise may create a surge of migrants, and the Biden administration is trying to return to what it views as a more humane asylum policy without encouraging an unmanageable stream of migrants that becomes both a humanitarian and political crisis.
As the clock expired on Title 42 last night, Homeland Security Secretary ALEJANDRO MAYORKAS released a tough statement on the Biden administrations new enforcement efforts.
Starting tonight, people who arrive at the border without using a lawful pathway will be presumed ineligible for asylum. We are ready to humanely process and remove people without a legal basis to remain in the U.S. We have 24,000 Border Patrol Agents and Officers at the Southwest Border and have surged thousands of troops and contractors, and over a thousand asylum officers to help enforce our laws. Do not believe the lies of smugglers. The border is not open. People who do not use available lawful pathways to enter the U.S. now face tougher consequences, including a minimum five-year ban on re-entry and potential criminal prosecution. Together with our partners throughout the federal government and Western Hemisphere, we are prepared for this transition.
TITLE 42 READS 
THE PLAYBOOK INTERVIEW: HENRY CUELLAR The border-state Democrat has a lot to say about the Biden administrations record on immigration.
Cuellar was born to immigrant farm workers in Laredo, Texas, went to college and law school, eventually jumped into Texas politics and, in 2004, was elected to Congress. His district, the Texas 28th, stretches from San Antonio to Laredo and includes 200 miles of the southern border.
The first thing you notice when visiting Cuellars office in Rayburn are the letters PhD after his name on the plaque next to his door. His parents drilled into him the importance of education, and hes never stopped going to school. He likes to point out that hes got more degrees than anyone else on the Hill: an A.A, a B.S., an M.A., a J.D., and that PhD. (Hes currently studying at the Naval War College for another degree.)
The left does not like him. In the last two election cycles, he was targeted by national progressives and barely survived primary challenges. One reason: immigration an issue where he is well-known for being to the right of many of his Democratic colleagues. Hes also been frustrated with Biden, who he thinks has been too captured by their partys liberal wing on this issue. (Though he voted, along with every other House Democrat, against the border security bill that House Republicans put on the floor yesterday.)
Cuellar is a lonely centrist on an issue that has become much more polarized over the last decade. And he thinks Joe Biden should join him in the middle and stop taking advice from the left, as the president braces for the coming aftershocks of his Title 42 decision.
You can listen to the full interview on the Playbook Deep Dive Podcast. What follows are some key excerpts.
On the buses of migrants being sent from Texas to big cities up north:
The buses that theyre sending to D.C. or Chicago or New York are just a drop of what a border community [sees] and theyre already complaining. Theyre already complaining. Theyre talking about sending buses from New York City to other places! I had that position way before DeSantis was governor that was back in 2014. Its different when it happens in your own backyard.
On the resentment directed at new migrants by Hispanics:
A lot of first-generation Americans mainly Hispanics in South Texas theyre saying: Hold it. We and our parents came in through a long process, [a] legal process. And theyre seeing people just come through the border. It causes a little resentment. And I emphasize the word resentment, because a lot of first-generation Hispanics did it the right way.
On how Biden is perceived in border communities:
We at the border, we always smile: Every time theres a new president, its one extreme the other way and then another extreme when it deals with the border. Trump comes in, separates kids wants to build a wall and all that one extreme. Then the impression in my area is Bidens [going] the other way: Hey, let everybody in even though they say dont let anybody in. When you say the borders not open, but youre watching, and people are just streaming in? I mean, let me ask you: What was the last time you saw somebody being deported?
On the shift Biden is attempting:
Politically, now the presidents trying to move to the center when it comes to immigration policies I think a little bit too late, but theyre moving to the center now.
On the political salience of images from the border:
You open up the newspaper. You turn on the TV and [listen to the] radio whatever the case. They see this every day. So that gets ingrained in their minds. . The image, you know, is powerful. What were seeing at the border is powerful. When I see this affecting folks [who] are not political at all but are worried about it that has to have an impact. And if we start losing Democrats to the Republicans, they feel were not doing the job and securing the border or we start losing the independents because the Independents were with Biden. He doesnt want to lose those Independents.
MEANWHILE Our colleague Brittany Gibson reports this morning that some progressive groups are thinking about taking another swing at Cuellar in 2024. NARAL Pro-Choice America, the abortion rights advocacy group, told POLITICO that it is committed to removing Cuellar from office. JOEL PAYNE, chief communications officer at MoveOn.org, didnt rule out spending on a primary. Other progressive organizations indicated that they may jump in again, too.
I think that appetite has turned more into a raging starvation, a Democrat who worked for multiple campaigns in the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas last cycle told Brittany.
Happy Friday. Thanks for reading Playbook. Drop us a line: Rachael Bade, Eugene Daniels, Ryan Lizza.
A message from PhRMA: 
Middlemen like PBMs are charging fees tied to the price of medicines, which means they make more money when the price of a medicine goes up. This business model allows PBM profits to soar and can lead to higher costs for patients. Its time to lower costs for patients by holding middlemen accountable.
INSIDE STORY N.Y. Mags Shawn McCreesh has a story up this morning, When Fox News Turns On Its Own, with a look inside Fox News in the post-TUCKER CARLSON world and the team of staffers he left behind: Paranoia, conspiracy, and character assassination its like watching an hour of Tucker Carlson Tonight. And what an entertaining spectacle it is: The people who for years happily put out prime times most poisonous program never thought they would end up on this side of it.
BIG ATLANTIC READ The Abortion Absolutist, by The Atlantics Elaine Godfrey: WARREN HERN has been performing late abortions for half a century. After Roe, he is as busy with patients as ever.
LET THE DEM FREAKOUT COMMENCE For more than a year, Biden and his allies have been singing the same tune about the 2024 election: The world doubted us before, and well prove them wrong again. That conviction has only been fortified by the last two years, as major legislative strides and a better-than-expected midterm came in the face of routine skepticism.
But as Bidens campaign gears up, other Democrats are warning that the past cannot be considered prologue and theyre concerned the presidents team might be a touch overconfident about a Biden-Trump rematch.
The problem isnt just anemic poll numbers.
Top officials privately have expressed anxiety about the state of the presidents reelection operation, Eugene and Jonathan Lemire report. Currently, there is no headquarters and only a handful of full-time staffers in place, not one of which is a finance director. The presidents political team refuses to discuss its fundraising numbers in public, sparking anxiety among donors that the number is underwhelming and could continue to lag as the summer months approach.
This weeks bruising ABC-WaPo poll has some little to repair the frayed nerves among Bidens allies.
The ABC poll, while it is an outlier, its also a warning, right?said TERRANCE WOODBURY, CEO of HIT Strategies, a progressive polling firm. They are a very confident White House. Hes passed some damn good legislation. But that aint always good politics.
Aides close to Biden bristle at the criticism and even the critics themselves, arguing their track record should earn them the benefit of the doubt.
If youre the sort of coward whod rather throw stones at the people wrestling with the devil than at the devil himself, and who has no comparable record of success, it makes sense youd confuse strength with overconfidence, one 2020 Biden campaign alum told POLITICO. Reporters arent your therapists, kids.
Other Biden world officials insist they are taking nothing for granted, pointing out a bolstered DNC is handling the lions share of the work, while still others think that theres nothing that Biden world could do differently that would quash the angst that is practically part of the partys DNA.
Democrats are bedwetters, historically, said JIM MESSINA, who managed BARACK OBAMAs reelection campaign.Theres like, just full-throated fucking panic.

CONGRESS
WHOS AT DEFAULT Biden and the Big Four congressional leaders are delaying their previously scheduled Friday meeting on the debt limit to give staffers more time to work on details, WaPos Paul Kane and Tyler Pager were first to report.
So what does the delay mean for the talks? Hard to say. One GOP lawmaker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private talks, said the meeting had been postponed because discussions among staff members had been moving too slowly, Kane and Pager write. Another person familiar with the matter disputed that, saying that the delay is a positive development that gives staff members more time to prepare options for the president and congressional leaders.
Meanwhile, our colleagues Sarah Ferris and Katherine Tully-McManusreport this morning that the flurry of negotiations on both the leadership and staff level look more and more like they could end in a spending-caps deal, a bargain not unlike the one that ended the 2011 fiscal cliff standoff between Republicans and then-President Barack Obama.
Sarah and Katherine note that the biggest obstacle to such a deal may be length, with House Republicans thinking much more long-term than Biden and his Democratic negotiators. White House officials are privately aiming for a two-year deal that would lift the debt limit and impose new limits on discretionary spending, while McCarthys camp made clear Thursday that theyre dreaming much bigger 10 years, to be precise.

TRUMP TRIES AGAIN CNNs Trump town hall offered a peek at Trumps second-term vision, NYTs Shane Goldmacher, Jonathan Swan, Maggie Haberman and Stephanie Lai write. The gist: Its a sharp departure from core American values that have been at the bedrock of the nation for decades: its creditworthiness, its credibility with international allies and its adherence to the rule of law at home.
Notable quotable: From my perspective, there was an evolution of Donald Trump over his four years, with 2020 I think being the most dramatic example of him the real him, former Trump Defense Secretary MARK ESPER told the Times. And I suspect that would be his starting point if he were to win office in 2024.

THE WHITE HOUSE
FIRST IN PLAYBOOK Yesterday, White House chief of staff JEFFZIENTS met with student loan forgiveness advocates from 17 organizations to discuss ongoing efforts on debt relief and higher education priorities, according to a person familiar with the meeting.
One attendee said they left feeling reassured that Zients understood the stakes of the issue and was taking it seriously. (Loan forgiveness advocates had a good relationship with Bidens first chief RONKLAIN, and some were unsure if that high level access would continue under his successor.) The meeting comes just weeks before expected rulings from the Supreme Court on two challenges to Bidens student loan forgiveness plan.

JBS's Fiscal Council reviewed the Financial Statements and issued an opinion on March 26, 2024, indicating that the Financial Statements are in a condition to be disclosed by the Company. Additionally, the Company's Statutory Audit Committee, in a meeting held on March 25, 2024, issued its report recommending that the Financial Statements be forwarded to the Company's Board of Directors for evaluation.

Management proposes to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting the election of the candidates and their respective alternates indicated above for the Fiscal Council of JBS.
Management clarifies that, pursuant to article 11 of CVM Resolution 81, the information regarding the professional experience of the candidates for the positions of members of the Fiscal Council indicated above are detailed in Appendix II
 of this Proposal, pursuant to items 7.3 to 7.6 of the Reference Form.
5. Resolve on the setting of the overall amount of the annual compensation of the Company's management and members of the Fiscal Council and the Statutory Audit Committee for fiscal year of 2024.
Management proposes to maintain the same amount approved by the Company's shareholders at the Annual Shareholders' Meeting held on April 24, 2023 (""ASM 2023
"").
3
Therefore, it proposes the approval of the annual and overall compensation for management and individual members of the Fiscal Council and the Statutory Audit Committee for the fiscal year of 2024, in the amount of up to R$269,342,164.59 (two hundred and sixty-nine million, three hundred and forty-two thousand, one hundred and sixty-four reais and fifty-nine cents).
With regard to the overall compensation of the members of the Company's Fiscal Council, management emphasizes that such amount will be, for each sitting member, equal to 0.1 (one tenth) of the compensation that, on average, is attributed to each executive officer, not including profit sharing, until the Company's next annual shareholder meeting, noting that such amount may only be altered according to article 162, paragraph 3, of the Brazilian Corporation Law. Additionally, alternate members will only receive remuneration in the absence of the respective sitting member.
The information relating to section 8 of the Reference Form can be found in Appendix III
 of this Proposal, in compliance with article 13 of CVM Resolution 81.
The amount proposed for the overall compensation for management relating to the fiscal year of 2024 is compatible with the amounts usually paid by the market and with the criteria and conditions adopted by the Company to comprise the compensation for the members of its management.
Management informs that the overall limit approved by the ASM 2023, relating to the compensation for the fiscal year of 2023, in the total amount of R$126,180,813.41 (one hundred and twenty-six million, one hundred and eighty thousand, eight hundred and thirteen reais and forty-one cents) was effectively paid.

The adherence of the nominated members, namely Kátia Regina de Abreu Gomes, Paulo Bernardo Silva and Cledorvino Belini with the independence criteria established in the Novo Mercado Regulation, in CVM Resolution 80/2022, and the Company's Bylaws was analyzed by the Company's Board of Directors and the members of its Governance, Compensation and Nomination Committee, who are in favor of their characterization as independent members.

3. To resolve on the increase in the number of members to comprise the Company's Board of Directors for the current term of office until the annual shareholders' meeting to be held in 2025, from 9 (nine) to 11 (eleven) members.
Pursuant to article 16 of JBS's Bylaws, the Board of Directors may be comprised of a minimum of 5 (five) and a maximum of 11 (eleven) members, with a unified term of office of 2 (two) years.
The Company's Annual General Meeting held on April 24, 2023, established the number of members to comprise the Board of Directors as 9 (nine), with a term of office the Annual Shareholders' Meeting to be held in 2025.
The Company's management proposes, in this AESM, the approval for 2 (two) new seats, increasing the number of sitting members from 9 (nine) to 11 (eleven), with a unified term of office of 2 (two) years, until the Annual Shareholders' Meeting that analyzes, discusses, and votes on management accounts and the financial statements for the fiscal year ended on December 31, 2024.

<table><tr><td>Name</td></tr><tr><td>

 The Company's Board of Directors expressed that the nomination of each candidate as member of the Board of Directors adheres to the Nomination and Training Policy for Members of the Board of Directors, Executive Board, and Committees.
Management clarifies that, pursuant to article 11 of CVM Resolution 81, the information regarding the professional experience of the candidates for the positions of members of the Board of Directors indicated above are detailed in Appendix II
 of this Proposal.
Lastly, considering this is not a general election for the Board of Directors, as understood by the CVM Board (Process CVM RJ 2016/4098 and Process CVM SEI 19957.009411/2017-46, app. on 04/02/2019), the procedures for the multiple voting and separate election will not apply to the elections of the members of the Board of Directors to be carried out at this meeting.
5. To resolve on the rectification, in the protocol and justification for the incorporation, by the Company, of Midtown Participações Ltda. (""Merger
"") on information related to the real estate properties transferred to the Company within the scope of the Merger, and ratify all other provisions set forth in said instrument.
With the purpose of including new properties to be transferred to JBS arising from the incorporation of Midtown Participações Ltda. (""Midtown
"") by JBS, approved by the Company's Annual and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting held on April 30, 2018, registered at JUCESP under file number 304.772/18-5 on July 29, 2018, management proposes the approval of the adjustments in Appendix III

""), and the information about the properties transferred to JBS within the scope of the Merger are provided in Appendix IV

The Company highlights that the Annual and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting, held on April 22, 2022, approved the inclusion of Appendix III to the Protocol, which included the description of certain properties to be transferred within the scope of the Merger, in compliance with requirements formulated by Notaries of Property Registration.
Furthermore, management proposes to ratify all other terms and conditions of the Merger established in the Protocol, with no changes being proposed in the structure of the Merger or in the rights and obligations attributed to the parties as a result of the Merger.
Management emphasizes that under the terms of the Protocol, Midtown was fully extinguished due to the Merger, being succeeded by the Company in all its rights and obligations, universally and for all legal purposes, without any continuity solution; and the Company's Annual and Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting, held on April 30, 2018, authorized the Company's Executive Board to perform all acts required to carry out the Merger.
6. To resolve on the amendment of article 10, paragraph 1, of the Company's Bylaws to update the minimum call notice deadline for JBS' Annual Shareholders' Meeting.
The Company's management proposes to amend paragraph 1, article 10 of JBS' Bylaws, considering the modification to Law 6,404/76, promoted by Law 14,195, of 2021, to establish the deadline for calling the Annual Shareholders' Meeting under current and applicable laws and regulations. The legal and regulatory deadlines are already observed by JBS for calling its shareholders' meetings, so the proposed change will not result in financial or legal effects.
If the proposed change is approved by this AESM, the new wording for article 10, paragraph 1, of the Company's Bylaws will come into effect as indicated in Appendix VI
. The table that highlights the changes and proposed amendment to the Bylaws, as well as its justification, as required by CVM Resolution 81, is available in Appendix V
 of this Proposal.
7. To authorize the Company's Executive Board to carry out all necessary or convenient acts to effectively implement the resolutions approved.
If shareholders approve the matters on the agenda, management proposes the Company's Executive Board to be authorized to perform any and all acts necessary or convenient to implement such matters, thus enabling the resolutions approved to come into effect.

Management informs that shareholders may participate in the AESM (i) in person (in this case, they may participate through a duly constituted proxy) or (ii) via Remote Voting Form, according to the documents made available on the websites of the CVM (www.cvm.gov.br), and B3 (www.b3.com.br), at the Company's headquarters, and on its Investor Relations website (https://ri.jbs.com.br/).
The Company suggests that, if possible, shareholders should prefer to participate in the AESM by submitting the Remote Voting Form to the service providers capable of collecting and transmitting instructions for filling out the form (custodian or bookkeeping agent), given the greater simplicity of this procedure.
JBS also informs that, exceptionally for this AESM, aiming to facilitate the participation of its shareholders, it will accept Remote Voting Forms, proxy instruments (duly accompanied by an identity document and/or relevant corporate acts that prove the grantor's powers) and other documents to be submitted via https://assembleia.ten.com.br/460498236 or by e-mail to ri@jbs.com.br, without notarization, legalization or apostille, according to the instructions available in the Call Notice.
Finally, the Company requests that the documents required for shareholders to participate in the AESM be sent preferably
 by 72 (seventy-two) hours prior to the meeting.

ANNEX I TO THE MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL FORORDINARY AND EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING OF JBS S.A.TO BE HELD ON APRIL 26, 2024
DIRECTORS´ COMMENTS
(As per item 1 of Annex I of CVM Resolution No. 81, of March 29, 2022)
2. Directors' Comments
2.1. Directors' comments on:
a) General financial and equity conditions
The Company's Executive Board believes that, through its product diversification strategy, its growth potential and its global production and distribution platform, combined with its positioning as a leader in the global animal protein market, JBS has sufficient financial and equity conditions to continue its business plan and meet its short and long-term obligations, including loans, financials as well as to finance its activities and cover its funding needs for at least the next 12 months.
As of December 31, 2023, the indebtedness ratio was 3.39x (represented by current liabilities plus non-current liabilities and divided by shareholders' equity), increasing compared to the 3.18x ratio of December 31, 2022. The increase presented in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 is primarily due to the distribution of R$2.2 billion in dividends.

The Company's Executive Board believes that the current capital structure presents adequate levels of leverage, taking into account its product diversification and its global production and distribution platform. The ratio of net debt (represented by current loans and financing plus non- current loans and financing and decreased by cash and cash equivalents) and shareholders' equity as of December 31, 2023 was 157.6%, in line when compared to the previous year, which also was 157.6%.
In the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company presented a balanced capital structure between equity and third parties in the proportion presented in the item (c) below.
c) Ability to pay in relation to financial commitments made

 Annex I-1
The Company's need for resources primarily refers to: (i) purchase of raw material, and the acquisition of animals and grains for feeding animals for processing represents an important portion of this account; (ii) tax, labor and social obligations; (iii) payment of interest and principal on loans and financing; (iv) payment of taxes; and (v) capital expenditures related to the acquisition and maintenance of fixed assets.
The Company's main sources of funds are: (i) cash generated by operating activities and (ii) loans and financing.
The Directors believe that the cash available, the cash generation from their operating activities and the refinancing of the Company's existing loans and financing will be sufficient to cover their liquidity needs and financial commitments for the next 12 months.
Adjusted EBITDA in the period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 was R$17,146.1 million and net financial expenses in the same period were R$6,748.0 million. Thus, Adjusted EBITDA presented a coverage index of 2.5 times net financial expenses. The net debt balance, composed of loans and financing deducted from cash and cash equivalents on December 31, 2023 was R$74,058.1 million, corresponding to 4.32 times the Adjusted EBITDA.
Adjusted EBITDA in the period from January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 was R$34,568.4 million and net financial expenses in the same period were R$6,352.3 million. Thus, Adjusted EBITDA presented a coverage index of 5.4 times net financial expenses. The net debt balance, composed of loans and financing deducted from cash and cash equivalents on December 31, 2022 was R$79,171.9 million, corresponding to 2.29 times the Adjusted EBITDA.
d) Sources of financing for working capital and for investments in non-current assets used
The Directors believe that the cash generation from the Company's operating activities is sufficient to meet working capital obligations and investments in non-current assets. If there are any mismatches in cash and cash equivalents with the amounts due in the short term, the Company has credit facilities in the main commercial banks operating in Brazil, the United States and other countries. The Company may also use issues of debt securities in the local and international capital markets.
e) Sources of financing for working capital and for investments in non-current assets that it intends to use to cover liquidity deficiencies
The Officers believe that the cash generation from the Company's operating activities is sufficient to meet working capital obligations and investments in non-current assets. If there are any mismatches in cash and cash equivalents with the amounts due in the short term, the Company has credit facilities in the main commercial banks operating in Brazil, the United States and other countries. The Company may also use issues of debt securities in the local and international capital markets.
f) Debt levels and the characteristics of such debts, further describing:
(i) Relevant loans and financing agreements
As of December 31, 2023, loan and financing agreements totaled R$96,821.8 million, of which R$4,316.4 million represented short-term loans and R$92,505.5 million corresponded to long- term loans. On this date, loan and financing agreements represented 60.8% of current and non- current liabilities, totaling R$159,113.8 million.
As of December 31, 2022, loan and financing agreements totaled R$92,354.1 million, of which R$8,228.6 million represented short-term loans and R$84,125.5 million corresponded to long- term loans. On this date, loan and financing agreements represented 58.3% of current and non- current liabilities, totaling R$158,301.7 million.
Our financing strategy has been and will be, over the next several years, to: (1) extend the average maturity of our outstanding indebtedness, including by refinancing short-term debt through longer-term borrowings and issuing longer-term debt securities, in order to increase our liquidity levels and improve our strategic, financial and operational flexibility; and (2) reduce our financing costs by accessing lower-cost sources of finance, including through the capital markets and export finance.
Based on the profile of our indebtedness as of December 31, 2023 and our track record, we believe we will continue to be able to raise funds in U.S. dollars, euros and reais to meet our financial obligations. We further believe that our capital expenditures during recent years, in addition to capital expenditures that we intend to make in the near future, will allow us to increase our ability to generate cash, to strengthen our credit ratios and to enhance our capacity to meet our financial obligations.

Annex I-11
Sustainability-Linked Bonds
We have issued three series of Sustainability-Linked Bonds in the international capital market, as follows:
<table><tr><td></td><td>
JBS USA 3.625% Sustainability-Linked Notes, maturing in January/2032 in the amount of US$923.0 million;
 </td></tr></table><table><tr><td></td><td>
JBS USA 3,000% Sustainability-Linked Notes, maturing in May/2032 in the amount of US$1.0 billion; and
 </td></tr></table><table><tr><td></td><td>
PPC 4.250% Sustainability-Linked Notes, maturing in April/2031 in the amount of US$1.0 billion.
 </td></tr></table>
As described below, each series of sustainability-linked notes contains certain sustainability performance targets from JBS S.A., JBS USA or PPC that, if not met, will result in an increase in the interest rate payable on the respective notes. However, the notes may not satisfy an investor's requirements or any future legal, quasi-legal or other standards for investing in assets with sustainability characteristics, and none of the issuers or their guarantors has committed to (i) allocating the net proceeds specifically to projects or business activities that meet sustainability criteria or (ii) are subject to any other limitations or requirements that may be associated with green bonds, social bonds or sustainability securities in any particular market.
The sustainability performance targets applicable to the notes are uniquely tailored to the business, operations and capabilities of JBS S.A., JBS USA and PPC, and do not easily lend themselves to comparisons with similar sustainability performance targets and the related performance of other companies. In addition, as there is currently no generally accepted definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise), nor a market consensus on what criteria a particular financial instrument should meet in order to qualify as ""green"", ""social"", ""sustainable"" or ""Sustainability- Linked"" (and, furthermore, the requirements of any label may evolve from time to time), no guarantee has been or could be given to investors by the issuers or guarantors of the notes or any second party opinion providers or any third-party assurance or attestation service provider appointed by each company (""External Verifier"") that the notes will meet all or any investor expectations with respect to the notes or the respective sustainability performance targets qualified as ""green,"" social "","" sustainable ""or"" linked to sustainability ""or that any adverse and/or other social impacts will not occur in connection with JBS, JBS S.A. and/or PPC USA or striving to achieve the respective sustainability performance targets and net resource use of the notes.
In addition, no guarantee or representation has been given by the issuers and guarantors of the notes, any third party opinion providers or any External Verifier as to the suitability or reliability for any purpose of any third party opinion, report or certification in connection with the offering of the notes or the respective sustainability performance targets to meet any green, social, sustainability, sustainability-linked and/or other criteria. Any opinion, report or certification is not - and should not be - considered.
There is no assurance as to the extent to which JBS S.A., JBS USA and/or PPC will be successful in significantly reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. While failure to achieve applicable sustainability performance targets will give rise to an upward adjustment of the interest rate relating to the notes, such failure will not be an event of default under the notes, nor will issuers and/or guarantors thereof be required to repurchase or redeem any notes in such circumstances.
Annex I-12
JBS USA 3.625% Sustainability-Linked, due in January/2032
In June 2021, JBS S.A. adopted a Structure of Bonds Linked to Sustainability establishing its strategic sustainability priorities and setting goals in relation to one of its main priority areas: Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity (as defined below). The long-term objective of JBS
S.A. is to reduce the Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity by the end of 2030, as measured against the base year 2019. As part of this goal, JBS S.A. has established a Sustainability Performance Target to reduce its Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity by 16.364% by December 31, 2025, based on linear annual improvements over the base year 2019, which will result in a 30% reduction by the end of 2030, subject to certain exclusions related to significant acquisitions and changes in laws and regulations.
JBS S.A. defines ""Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity"" as MTCO2e divided by metric tons (""MTCO2e/MT"") produced. JBS S.A. defines ""MTCO2e"" as the sum of Scope 1 emissions (primarily from burned fuels, dry ice/gaseous CO2 used as a manufacturing aid and wastewater treatment systems) and Scope 2 emissions (primarily from purchased electricity) during a given period of JBS S.A.'s global operations, measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, and ""tons produced"" as the sum of beef, chicken, fresh, frozen and value-added pork and their respective processed by-products and offals produced during a given period, measured in increments of metric tons. For the year ended December 31, 2019, JBS S.A.'s Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity was 0.2693 MTCO2e/MT produced (Scope 1 and 2), subject to third-party verification.
Pursuant to JBS USA's 3.625% Sustainability Linked Notes due January 2032, if JBS S.A. fails to meet the Sustainability Performance Target and provide confirmation to the fiduciary together with a related confirmation by an External Verifier at least 30 days prior to January 15, 2027, the interest rate payable on the notes will be increased by 25 basis points from January 15, 2027 until the due date of January 15, 2032 inclusive.
JBS USA 3,000% Sustainability-Linked Notes, due in May/2032
In November 2021, JBS USA adopted a Sustainability Linked Securities Framework setting out its strategic sustainability priorities and setting targets with respect to one of its key priority areas: Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity (as defined below). JBS USA's long-term goal is to reduce the Global Intensity of Greenhouse Gas Emissions by the end of 2030, as measured against the base year 2019. As part of this goal, JBS USA has established a Sustainability Performance Target to reduce its Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity by 20.30% by December 31, 2026, based on linear annual improvements over the base year 2019, which will result in a 30% reduction by the end of 2030, subject to certain exclusions related to significant acquisitions and changes in laws and regulations.
JBS USA defines ""Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity"" as MTCO2e divided by metric tons (""MTCO2e/MT"") produced. JBS USA defines ""MT of CO2e"" as the sum of Scope 1 emissions (primarily from burned fuels, dry ice/gaseous CO2 used as a manufacturing aid and wastewater treatment systems) and Scope 2 emissions (primarily from purchased electricity) during a given period of JBS USA's global operations, measured in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, and ""tons produced"" as the sum of beef, chicken, fresh, frozen and value-added pork and their respective processed by-products and offals produced during a given period, measured in increments of metric tons. For the year ended December 31, 2019, JBS USA's Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity was 0.23807 MTCO2e/MT produced (Scope 1 and 2), subject to third-party verification.
Annex I-13
Pursuant to JBS USA's 3,000% Sustainability Linked Notes due May 2032, if JBS USA fails to meet the Sustainability Performance Target and provide confirmation to the fiduciary together with a related confirmation by an External Verifier within six months after December 31, 2026, the interest rate payable on the notes will be increased by 25 basis points from November 15, 2027 through and including the due date of May 15, 2032.
PPC 4.250% Sustainability-Linked Notes, maturing in April/2031
In March 2021, PPC adopted a Structure of Bonds Linked to Sustainability establishing its strategic sustainability priorities and setting goals in relation to one of its main priority areas: Greenhouse Gas Emissions (as defined below). PPC's long-term goal is to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions intensity by the end of 2030, as measured against the base year 2019. As part of this target, PPC has established a Sustainability Performance Target to reduce its Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity by 17.679% by December 31, 2025, based on linear annual improvements over the base year 2019, which will result in a 30% reduction by the end of 2030, subject to certain exclusions related to significant acquisitions and changes in laws and regulations.
The PPC defines ""Greenhouse Gas Emission Intensity"" as tCO2e divided by 100 lbs. (""tCO2e/100 lbs."") produced. PPC defines ""tCO2e"" as the sum of Scope 1 emissions (from stationary and mobile sources) and Scope 2 emissions (from indirect emissions) during a given period of global operations, including, without limitation, the use of dry ice, measured in metrics tons of carbon dioxide equivalent and ""lbs. produced"" as the sum of fresh, frozen and value-added chicken, pork and their respective processed by-products and offals produced during a given period, measured in 100 lb. increments. For the year ended December 31, 2019, PPC's Greenhouse Gas Emissions Intensity was 0.00988 tCO2e/100 lbs. produced, subject to third-party verification.
Pursuant to the terms of the 4.250% Sustainability Linked Notes of PPC due April 2031, if PPC fails to meet the Sustainability Performance Target and provide confirmation to the administrator together with a related confirmation by an External Verifier at least 30 days prior to October 15, 2026, the interest rate payable on the notes will be increased by 25 basis points from October 15, 2026 through and including the due date of April 15, 2031.
Sustainability-Linked CRAs
In December 2021, JBS S.A. issued debentures underlying two series of CRAs linked to sustainability maturing in 2031 and 2036, respectively, in the aggregate principal amount of R$1.1 billion. These debentures are issued in reais and yield interest at rates of 5.8376% per annum and 6.1977% per annum, respectively.
As described below, these CRAs and the underlying debentures contain a sustainability performance target that, if not met, will result in an increase in the interest rate payable on the CRAs and the underlying debentures. However, CRAs and underlying debentures may not meet an investor's requirements or any future legal, quasi-legal or other standards for investment in assets with sustainability characteristics, and JBS S.A. has not committed to (i) allocate net proceeds specifically to projects or business activities that meet sustainability criteria or (ii) are subject to any other limitations or requirements that may be associated with green instruments, social instruments or sustainability instruments or other financial instruments in any particular market.
The sustainability performance target applicable to debentures and CRAs are uniquely tailored to the business, operations and capabilities of JBS S.A. and do not easily lend themselves to comparisons with similar sustainability performance targets and the related performance of other companies. In addition, as there is currently no generally accepted definition (legal, regulatory or otherwise), nor a market consensus on what criteria a particular financial instrument must meet to qualify as ""green"", ""social"", ""sustainable"" or ""sustainability-linked"" (and, furthermore, the requirements of any label may evolve from time to time), no guarantee has been or could be given to investors by JBS S.A., the issuer of the CRAs or any providers of second party or any third-party guarantor or attestation service provider appointed by JBS S.A. (""External Verifier"") that the debentures or CRAs will meet all or any investor expectations with respect to the debentures or CRAs or the sustainability performance target qualified as ""green"", ""social,"" ""sustainable"" or ""linked to sustainability"" or that any adverse social and/or other impacts will not occur in connection with JBS S.A. striving to achieve the sustainability performance target or the use of the net proceeds from the offering of the debentures or CRAs.
Annex I-14
In addition, no guarantee or representation has been given by JBS S.A., the issuer of the CRAs, any third party opinion providers or any External Verifier as to the suitability or reliability for any purpose of any third party opinion, report or certification in connection with the offering of the CRAs and the underlying debentures or the respective sustainability performance targets to meet any green, social, sustainability, sustainability-linked and/or other criteria. Any opinion, report or certification is not - and should not be - considered, included and/or made part of this prospectus or registration statement.
There is no guarantee as to the extent to which JBS S.A. will be successful in significantly diminishing its sustainability performance globally. Although failure to meet the sustainability performance target will give rise to an upward adjustment of the interest rate relating to the CRAs and the underlying debentures, such failure will not be an event of default under the CRAs or the underlying debentures nor will their issuers be required to repurchase or redeem the CRAs or the underlying debentures in such circumstances.
In October 2021, JBS S.A. adopted a Sustainability Linked Framework establishing its commitment to a deforestation-free supply chain in Brazil, ensuring that all suppliers comply with its zero tolerance policy for illegal deforestation and other social and environmental criteria described in its Responsible Sourcing Policy As part of this objective, JBS S.A. established a Sustainability Performance Goal to have the number of cattle related to direct suppliers registered in its Transparent Livestock Platform by the end of 2025 equal to 100% of the number of cattle slaughtered by JBS S.A. in Brazil in 2024. The Sustainability-linked framework is not included in this prospectus or the registration statement, nor is it incorporated into this prospectus or the registration statement by reference.
JBS S.A. has developed a supplier monitoring system that uses satellite images and georeferenced data from supplier farms to try to ensure that the company buys raw material only from producers who fully meet its socio-environmental criteria, including zero tolerance for illegal deforestation and encroachment on protected areas, such as indigenous lands or environmental preservation areas; having no areas embargoed by the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA); and not being on the Ministry of the Economy's Forced Labor Black List. The system also blocks the purchase of livestock from farmers involved in rural violence or land conflicts. As a result, JBS S.A. has blocked more than 11,000 cattle supply farms for non-compliance to date. In 2020, JBS S.A. made a stronger commitment to sustainability in the Amazon biome by launching its own privately funded blockchain platform, the Transparent Livestock Platform, which enables JBS to advance cattle traceability and monitor its entire livestock supply chain, including suppliers from our suppliers. Direct livestock suppliers have been asked to provide information about their suppliers through the Transparent Livestock Platform, which analyzes compliance suppliers from our suppliers' farms, which will be validated by third parties. The result of the analysis will be sent directly to the JBS supplier, who will be able to view socio-environmental compliance throughout its supply chain. It is our goal, through blockchain technology, to maintain a commitment to the security and confidentiality of third party information throughout the process. Direct suppliers are responsible for registering their own suppliers (i.e. our secondary suppliers) on the platform. The direct suppliers will collect your data through a specific application - developed by us - that will screen the necessary information from the official documents for the platform. The platform will automatically send the results of the socio-environmental analysis of secondary suppliers' ownership to direct suppliers, allowing them to manage their own supply chain, in accordance with JBS S.A's Responsible Procurement Policy.
As of January 1, 2026, it will be mandatory for all JBS S.A. direct livestock suppliers to adhere to the Transparent Livestock Platform and demonstrate that their own supply chain meets JBS S.A's Responsible Procurement Policy. Suppliers who do not cooperate and comply will be prevented from selling to JBS S.A. A transparent roadmap with intermediate targets to assess progress from now until 2025 has also been developed. This includes annual targets based on the previous year's total slaughter and expressed in number of heads of cattle for each period, to ensure incremental progress. Annual targets will be checked annually by third parties.
Under the sustainability-related CRAs, if JBS S.A. fails to meet the Sustainability Performance Target and confirms this by an External Verifier by May 31, 2026, the interest rate payable on the underlying CRAs and debentures will be increased by 25 basis points and including May 31, 2026 up to and including the respective maturity dates.

(prior to its dissolution), JBS Australia and JBS Canada, as borrowers, entered into an unsecured revolving credit facility (the ""JBS USA Senior Unsecured Revolving Facility""), with Bank of Montreal, as administrative agent, and the lender parties thereto. The JBS USA Senior Unsecured Revolving Facility provides for a revolving credit commitment in an amount up to US$1,500.0 million with a maturity in 2027, with two one-year extension options at each lender's discretion. The facility is available in two tranches of US$900.0 million and US$600.0 million and in multiple currencies, subject to sub-limits with respect to any amounts borrowed in currencies other than amounts borrowed in Dollars.

Collateral Cure. After the end of any fiscal quarter, the borrowers may give notice that they will not be in compliance with the JBS USA Financial Maintenance Covenant and instead may elect to cause the borrowers, the guarantors and each subsidiary guarantor to provide security interests in the collateral that secured the prior secured revolving credit facility (the ""JBS USA Collateral Cure""). From and after the date of the JBS USA Collateral Cure, the JBS USA Financial Maintenance Covenant will no longer be in effect and availability under the JBS USA Senior Unsecured Revolving Facility will be limited and subject to collateral coverage utilizing a 75% advance rate on U.S. receivables and a 50% advance rate on U.S. inventory, subject to certain exceptions.

PPC Credit Facility
On October 4, 2023, PPC and certain of PPC's subsidiaries entered into a Revolving Syndicated Facility Agreement (the ""PPC Revolving Credit Facility"") with CoBank, ACB as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the other lenders party thereto. The PPC Revolving Credit Facility replaced the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of August 9, 2021 (as amended, modified, extended, restated, amended and restated, replaced, or supplemented prior to the date hereof, the ""PPC Existing Credit Agreement""). The PPC Revolving Credit increased PPC's availability under the revolving loan commitment from $800.0 million to $850.0 million, amended certain covenants, and extended the maturity date of PPC's revolving loan commitments from August 9, 2026 to October 4, 2028.

JBS S.A. Agribusiness Receivables Certificates
From October 2019 through October 2023, JBS S.A. issued several series of non-convertible unsecured debentures through private placements in Brazil, with maturities ranging from 2023 until 2038. These debentures are denominated in Brazilian reais and bear interest at various rates, with an annual average interest rate of 5.81% as of December 31, 2023. A larger part of these debentures have their principal amount adjusted according to the Brazilian inflation - IPCA (Índice Nacional de Preços ao Consumidor Amplo). These debentures underlie the securitization of agribusiness receivables in Brazil through the issuance of agribusiness receivables certificates (Certificados de Recebíveis do Agronegócio) (""CRAs""). The net proceeds from the issuances of these debentures have been used primarily to acquire cattle, natural products and other inputs necessary for the processing or industrialization of bovine cattle, including the slaughter, preparation of by-products, and the manufacturing of meat products from the primary slaughter process mentioned above, as well as the sale of the resulting products and by-products of such process, including exportation, intermediation, storage, and transportation of the products, by- products, and derivatives. As of December 31, 2023, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the CRAs was US$2,201.3 million.

Since the first quarter of 2022, our loan structure has been revised and our intercompany loans have been converted into equity investments that, in substance, form part of the reporting entity's net investment in an overseas operation, and for which foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive investments;

The nominal income tax rate in Brazil is 34%, but the Company's effective rate may vary from period to period based primarily on fluctuations in taxable income generated by each of its subsidiaries abroad, as well as differences in nominal tax rates and tax credits generated from the taxes paid in each of these subsidiaries abroad, which can be used to offset income tax and social contribution on income due in Brazil.
In addition, permanent differences generated during the period may also impact the Company's effective rate. Such amounts generally refer to non-taxable interest on foreign subsidiaries, tax credits paid abroad, amortization of goodwill in Brazil and tax paid abroad on dividends received by non-integral subsidiaries.
In the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the effective income tax rates were different from the nominal income tax rate in Brazil mainly due to the Company having recorded a net loss in 2023 compared to a net profit in 2022, but also due to the recognition of some permanent differences, such as (1) subsidies for investments that the Company and its subsidiaries have granted by state governments, as ICMS credits - Tax on the Circulation of Goods and Services, which are granted as a stimulus to the implementation or expansion of economic enterprises. In other jurisdictions, the Company receives energy grants and training. When the reduction in income tax expense reflects the deductibility of such incentives, all conditions related to government grants have been met. Subsidies are recognized under the heading ""Sales deductions - Sales tax"" in the income statements; (2) deferred tax not constituted as a result of the reduction of financial expenses and following the policy of analysis of future profitability, the indirect subsidiary Seara Alimentos recorded deferred taxes of tax losses not constituted in previous years, considering the expectation of future taxable profits that will be available to offset such losses. The Company expects that its effective rate will continue to fluctuate in the future due to the impacts of deductions from intercompany financing and other items.

Impacts of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine:
The Russia-Ukraine war began in February 2022. The impact of the ongoing war and sanctions will not be limited to companies operating in Russia and Ukraine and could negatively impact other global economic markets, including where we operate. Impacts have included and may continue to include but are not limited to higher commodity prices such as food, ingredients and energy products, rising inflation in some countries and disruption of trade and supply chains. The conflict disrupted shipments of grain, vegetable oils, fertilizers and energy products.
The impact on agricultural markets falls into two main categories: (i) the effect on Ukrainian agricultural production, since the region is fundamental in global grain production; and (ii) the duration of the interruption in trade flows. Security and financing concerns in the region are restricting the execution of exports, which in turn is forcing demand for grain and oil to find alternative supplies. The duration of the war and related volatility make global markets extremely sensitive to the growing season's climate in other global grain-producing regions and have led to a large risk premium in future prices. Continued volatility in global markets as a result of the war has negatively affected our costs, driving up prices, increasing inflation and increasing pressure on the supply of feed ingredients and energy products in global markets. In the second quarter of 2023, Ukraine grain export volumes continued to recover, but still remain below pre-war volumes. Their supply constraints did not have a material impact on our costs during the second quarter. However, if the Black Sea Grain Initiative remains suspended, supply constraints may worsen materially.
Annex I-31
In addition, the U.S. government and other governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate have imposed sanctions and export controls against Russia, Belarus and their interests and threatened additional sanctions and controls. Our business may be impacted by rising energy prices and the availability of energy during the winter months. The impact of these measures, now and in the future, may adversely affect our business, supply chain or customers.
Also, as highlighted in note 29 of financial instruments of the financial statement of December 31, 2022, the Company and its subsidiaries generate various exposures to market, credit and liquidity risk. Such exposures are controlled in an integrated manner by the Risk Management Board, following guidelines outlined in the Financial and Commodity Risk Management Policy defined by the Risk Management Committee and approved by the Board of Directors. The Risk Control Board is responsible for mapping the risk factors that may lead to harmful financial results in the various areas of the Company and also for proposing strategies to mitigate these exposures. Its proposals are submitted to the Risk Management Committee for evaluation for subsequent submission to the Board of Directors, which oversees the implementation of the new solutions, observing limitations of scope and the guidelines of the Financial and Commodity Risk Management Policy.
Moreover, on October 7, 2023, Hamas attacked Israel, with Israel then declaring war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Escalation or expansion of hostilities, interventions by other groups or nations, the imposition of economic sanctions, disruption of shipping transit in the Straits of Hormuz or other significant trade routes, or similar outcomes could adversely affect the international trade, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Although we do not have manufacturing operations in the affected regions, we are monitoring the development and unfolding of the situation and its potential effects on our sector and operations. As of the date of this annual report, no significant impacts have been measured.
Finally, considering all subsequent events that occurred up to the date of disclosure of the financial statements, no significant effects were identified that could affect the recoverability of the assets, or change the measurement of expected losses of these statements.
Acquisitions
The Company's consolidated income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 have limited comparability with the consolidated income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of the acquisitions of (i) Vivera on June 17, 2021, (ii) Pilgrim's Food Masters on September 27, 2021, (iii) acquisition of Huon on November 17, 2021, (iv) acquisition of Sunnyvalley on December 1, 2021, (v) acquisition of Rivalea on January 4, 2022 and (vi) acquisition of TriOak on December 2, 2022.
In the analysis of operating income made by the Company for the comparison between the periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, net revenue from acquisitions is deducted from organic net revenue. The amount of net revenue from significant acquisitions that we exclude from organic revenue will depend on the measurement period and the date of completion of the acquisition. For example, in our comparison of the period ended December 31, 2022 versus the period ended December 31, 2021, (i) the acquisition of Vivera that was completed on June 17, 2021, the impact of this acquisition was excluded from organic revenue for the period from January 1, 2022 to November 17, 2022; (ii) The acquisition of Pilgrim's Food Masters that was completed on September 27, 2021, the impact of this acquisition was excluded from organic revenue for the period from January 1, 2022 to September 27, 2022, (iii) the acquisition of Huon was completed on November 17, 2021, the impact of this acquisition was excluded from organic revenue for the period from January 1, 2022 to November 17, 2022, (iv) the acquisition of Sunnyvalley was completed on December 1, 2021, the impact of this acquisition was excluded from organic revenue for the period from January 1, 2022 to December 1, 2022 of 2022, and (v) the acquisition of Rivalea was completed on January 4, 2022, the impact of this acquisition was excluded from organic revenue for the period from January 4, 2022 to December 31, 2022 and (vi) the acquisition of TriOak was completed on December 2, 2022, the impact of this acquisition was excluded from organic revenue for the period from December 2, 2022 to December 31, 2022.
Annex I-32
Exchange Rate Variation
As a global company with approximately 87% of revenue generated outside Brazil in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Company's operating results and financial condition were and will continue to be affected by the depreciation or appreciation rate of the Brazilian Real in relation to foreign currencies. Any depreciation or appreciation of the Brazilian real in relation to foreign currencies may affect the Company's revenues, causing a monetary increase or decrease, provided that the other variables remain unchanged. In addition, a substantial portion of the Company's loans and financing are stipulated in foreign currencies. For this reason, any depreciation of the Brazilian Real against foreign currencies may significantly increase the Company's financial expenses and its current and non-current loans and financing stipulated in Brazilian reais. On the other hand, any appreciation of the Real in relation to foreign currencies can significantly decrease current and non-current financial expenses, loans and financing determined in reais.
The effect of currency conversion affects the consolidated revenues and expenses generated by the Company's subsidiaries that have functional currencies other than the real, primarily JBS USA. The revenue adjustment is such that organic net revenue is presented on a constant currency basis, which isolates the effect of currency changes during the period. The effect of currency conversion is calculated by multiplying the income or expense line determined in the functional currency in the current period by the difference in the average exchange rates used to convert the income or expense line in the periods presented.
The average exchange rate of the real/dollar was R$4.99 per US$1.00 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, representing an appreciation of the real of 3.3% in relation to the corresponding period in 2022. The average exchange rate of the real/dollar was R$5.16 per US$1.00 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, representing an appreciation of the real of 4.5% in relation to the corresponding period in 2021.
The final real/dollar exchange rate on December 31, 2023 was R$4.84 per US$1.00, representing an appreciation of the real of 7.2% against the exchange rate on December 31, 2022.
(b) material changes in revenues attributable to the introduction of new products and services, changes in volumes and price changes, exchange rates and inflation.
In the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the Company's consolidated net operating revenue reduced 2.9% compared to the same period of the previous year, totaling R$363,816.5 million.
Comments on changes in revenues attributable to price changes, exchange rates, inflation, volume changes and introduction of new products and services are made above in section 2.1 (h) - significant changes in each item of the financial statements.
Annex I-33
Sensitivity analysis
In order to provide information on how the risks of exchange rates of the real against the US dollar to which the Company is exposed on December 31, 2023 would behave, the following are possible changes, of 25% and 50%, in the relevant risk variables, in relation to the closing quotations used in the measurement of its financial assets and liabilities, on the base date of these interim financial statements. For the calculation of the effect on the result in a probable scenario, the Company considers it appropriate to use the Value at Risk (VaR) methodology, for a 99% confidence interval and a one-day horizon. The results of this analysis are presented below in R$ thousand.

In the explanatory note to the 2023 Annual Financial Statements number 27 - Financial instruments and risk management - of the Interim Financial Statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company presents the sensitivity analysis of its foreign exchange risks associated with its exposures to other foreign currencies and also sensitivity analysis of its exposures to the main commodities.
c) material impacts of inflation, price variation of the main inputs and products, exchange and interest rates on the issuer's operating result and financial result:
Operating Income
The Company's operating performance may be affected by the cost of acquiring live animals and grains for feeding chickens and pigs, which in turn are impacted by supply and demand, and consequently by inflation, in force in the markets where the company operates. Raw material cost represented approximately 75.9% and 73.9% of the cost of production in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Gross sales revenue is affected by inflation since, in general, the Company passes on part or all of the increases in costs to its customers in the markets in which it operates through price increases. The Company cannot predict, however, whether it will be able to pass on the increase in costs to its customers in the future. Sales in the domestic markets where the Company operates directly represented 75.6% and 74.5% of gross sales revenue in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Gross sales revenue can also be affected by the exchange rate since a significant portion of the Company's sales are destined to the foreign market. Exports represented 24.4% and 25.5% of gross sales operating revenue in 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Annex I-34
Financial Result
Foreign exchange variations affected and may continue to affect the financial result and indebtedness in the future, given that the Company has a portion of the indebtedness denominated in foreign currency. On December 31, 2023 and 2023, the indebtedness denominated in foreign currency was R$1,503.2 million on December 31, 2023 and R$7,146.0 million on December 31, 2022 and represented 0.7% and 3.4% of the sum of liabilities and shareholders' equity, respectively.
The Company's market risk exposures are constantly monitored, especially risk factors related to exchange rate variations, interest rates and commodity prices that potentially affect the value of financial assets and liabilities, future cash flows and net investments in operations abroad. In these cases, the Company and its subsidiaries employ financial protection instruments, including derivatives, provided that they are approved by the Risk Management Committee.
In 2023, the Company obtained financial expenses with derivatives of R$411.4 million and financial revenues with exchange rate variations of R$294.6 million. In 2022, the Company obtained financial revenues with derivatives of R$1,797.4 million and financial expenses with exchange rate variations of R$2,206.6 million.
As of December 31, 2023, a portion of the Company's total indebtedness was subject to fluctuations in interest rates, specifically the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, and the Brazil interbank deposit rate (Certificate of Interbank Deposit), or CDI, as published by CETIP and the Long-Term Interest Rate, or TJLP.
Inflation Rates
Most of the countries and regions in which we operate, including the United States, Brazil, Australia, Mexico and Europe, are currently experiencing steep inflation. None of the locations where we operate are experiencing hyperinflation. All segments had inflation in operating costs, especially in labor, freight and transportation of some materials. We also experienced high average selling prices impacted by the current inflationary environment. We responded to inflationary challenges in 2023 by continuing negotiations with clients to recoup the extraordinary costs we face. We also continue to focus on operational initiatives that aim to deliver labor efficiency, improved agricultural performance, and improved yields.
Variation of main inputs and products
Our main raw materials are cattle and feed ingredients for our chicken and pork operations. Raw materials accounted for most of the total cost of goods sold during the year ended December 31, 2022. Changes in the price of cattle, pigs and feed ingredients have a direct impact on operating costs and are based on factors beyond the control of our management, such as climate, supply volume, transportation costs, agricultural policies and others. We seek to protect the price paid for cattle purchased through financial instruments in order to try to protect ourselves from price variations between the date of purchase and the date of delivery. Our risk management department is responsible for mapping JBS Group commodity price exposures and proposing strategies to our risk management committee in order to mitigate such exposures. Biological assets are a very important raw material used by us. In order to maintain the future supply of these materials, we participate in forward contracts to anticipate purchases with suppliers. To complement these forward purchases, we use derivative instruments to mitigate each specific exposure, primarily futures contracts, to mitigate the impact of price fluctuations on inventories and sales contracts. We use the historical average amount spent on raw materials as an indication of the operating value to be protected by firm purchase agreements. The price of cattle, pigs and feed ingredients in domestic markets has fluctuated significantly in the past, and we believe it will continue to fluctuate in the coming years. Any increase in the price of cattle, pigs and feed ingredients and, consequently, in production costs may adversely affect our gross margins and our operating results if we are not able to pass on these price increases to our customers. On the other hand, any reduction in the price of cattle, pigs and feed ingredients and, consequently, our production costs, can positively impact our gross margins and our operating results.
Annex I-35
Exchange
As a global company, our results of operations and financial condition have been and will continue to be exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
Any depreciation or appreciation of the foreign currency exchange rate may impact our revenues, costs and expenses causing monetary increase or decrease, provided that the other variables remain unchanged. In addition, a portion of our loans and financing are denominated in foreign currencies. For this reason, any movement in the exchange rate may significantly increase or decrease our financial expenses and our current and non-current loans and financing. In addition, a portion of our assets, liabilities and revenues, costs and expenses are converted to the United States. Dollars for reporting purposes.
Our risk management department contracts derivative instruments previously approved by our board of directors to protect financial assets and liabilities and future cash flow from commercial activities and net investments in foreign operations. Our board of directors has approved financial instruments to hedge our exposure to loans, investments, interest payments cash flows, export estimation, raw material acquisition and other transactions, whenever they are quoted in currencies other than ours or the functional currency of our subsidiaries. The main exposures to exchange rate risk are in the US. Dollars, Euros, Pounds Sterling, Mexican Pesos and Australian Dollars.
Interest Rate
The Company has assets and primarily liabilities exposed to this risk, in operations linked to indexes such as CDI (Interbank Deposit Certificate), LIBOR (London Interbank Offer Rate), IPCA (Broad National Consumer Price Index) and SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate), among others. The Financial and Commodity Risk Management Policy does not provide mandatory guidelines regarding the proportion of exposures to pre-fixed or post-fixed rates, however, the Risk Control Board constantly monitors market conditions and may propose to the Risk Management Committee strategies involving indexers in order to reduce the Company's global exposure. The Risk Management Committee manages and monitors the Company's transition to transition rates. The Commission assesses the extent to which the contracts refer to LIBOR's cash flows, and whether these contracts will need to be amended as a result of the reform of LIBOR and how to manage the communication on the reform with counterparties. Accordingly, the Commission makes available periodic reports to the Administration of the interest rate risk and the risks arising from the reform of LIBOR.
2.3. Directors' comments on changes in accounting practices/modified opinions and emphases in the auditor's report
a) Changes in accounting practices that have resulted in significant effects on the information set out in paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2
There were no significant changes between the accounting practices adopted in the Company's financial statements in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.
b) Modified opinions and emphases in the auditor's report
There were no reservations or emphases in the Company's independent auditor's report with respect to the Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.
Annex I-36
2.4. Material effects on the financial statements
a) introduction or disposal of operating segment
As of 2022, the Company changed its management structure, and segment information began to be prepared considering JBS Australia as an individual segment. Prior to 2022, JBS Australia was embedded within the JBS Beef North America operating segment.
b) constitution, acquisition or disposal of equity interest
It is part of the Company's business strategy, the acquisition of companies, but the company maintains its current focus on gaining efficiency, both operational and financial, of its operations. Since its foundation, the Company has already made different acquisitions that added revenues from these companies.
Relevant operational events:
The Company uses the acquisition cost accounting allocation method to record business combinations that are not under common control. The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated by the sum of the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred on the acquisition date to the former controlling shareholders of the acquiree, and interests issued in exchange for control of the acquiree. Generally, all assets acquired and liabilities incurred and contingent liabilities assumed are initially measured at fair value as of the acquisition date. The Company recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree in an acquisition on an acquisition basis, or at fair value or proportionate share of the non-controlling interest in the amounts recorded in the net assets. Acquisition-related costs are recognized in profit or loss when incurred.
The excess (i) of the consideration transferred; (ii) of the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree (when applicable); and (iii) of the fair value, on the acquisition date, of any previous equity interest in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. When the sum of the three items above is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired, the gain is recognized directly in the income statement for the period as ""Bargaining gain"".
On June 8, 2021, JBS entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of Rivalea Holdings Pty Ltd and 100% of Oxdale Dairy Enterprise Pty Ltd (collectively, ""Rivalea""), a leader in pig breeding and processing in Australia, for an enterprise value of AU$175 million. The acquisition was completed on January 4, 2022.
On November 17, 2021, JBS Global Luxembourg S.à r.l., a subsidiary of JBS, entered into an agreement to acquire control of the Spanish company BioTech Foods, S.L., marking the Company's entry into the cultured protein market. The acquisition was completed on May 9, 2022.
On December 13, 2021, Rigamonti, a subsidiary of JBS, signed an agreement to acquire 100% of the King's Group, an Italian specialty producer, with an investment of 82 million. The acquisition was completed on February 7, 2022.
On December 2, 2022, JBS USA, the Company's indirect controlled subsidiary, entered into an agreement for the acquisition of TriOak Foods, which operates in multiple states of the United States, in the processing of pork and marketing of grains.

On December 22, 2022, the Company disclosed a Material Fact notifying the execution of an agreement to terminate CAM Arbitral Procedure No. 186/2021, in which J&amp;F Investimentos S.A. undertook to pay the Company the amount of R$543,164,722.88 (five hundred and forty-three million, one hundred and sixty-four thousand, seven hundred and twenty-two reais and eighty- eight cents).
An Independent Ad Hoc Committee was formed, composed of five independent members of the Board of Directors, who analyzed the facts related to the arbitration and negotiated the agreement over 6 months, and in the end recommended its unanimous approval.
The transaction involved mutual settlement of indemnities arising from the facts narrated in the Collaboration Agreements entered into by the Company's controllers and former administrators with the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office, and ended all claims formulated in the proceeding, including claims related to the merger of Bertin S.A. by the Company, the Blessed Holdings theme, as well as the counterclaims formulated against the Company in a much higher amount, and was approved by the competent Arbitral Tribunal.
It should be noted that the Independent Ad Hoc Committee was duly advised by external lawyers hired independently in all phases of its activities, including in the analysis and negotiation of the agreement. The agreement was approved, also unanimously, by the Board of Directors on December 16, 2022.

In 2023, the Company used Adjusted EBITDA as a non-accounting measurement, as well as in 2022.
In the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company's Adjusted EBITDA was calculated in the amount of R$17,146.1 million, while in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 it was R$34,568.4 million.
Even so, the Company informs that it uses economic and financial indicators in its analysis of results and disclosures to the market, however such indicators are not detailed in this section of the reference form, as Management does not understand that these indicators are non-accounting measurements.
b) make reconciliations between the amounts disclosed and the amounts of the audited financial statements

Adjusted EBITDA, which can be defined as profits before net financial income (expenses), income tax and social contribution, depreciation and amortization, equity method result and other non-recurring results, is used as a performance measure of the Company's Management.
The Company uses as a non-accounting measure the Adjusted EBITDA (according to Articles 4 and 5 of CVM Instruction No. nº 156 of June 23, 2022) adjusting the equity method result, and other non-recurring results.
The equity method result is allocated under the specific heading of the income statement.
Of the other non-recurring results, the adjusted balances are allocated in the income statement for the year ended December 31, 2022 under the following headings: ""Other revenues"" arising from extemporaneous tax debts and credits and J&amp;F Indemnity - net of PIS/COFINS, on the other hand, the ""other expenses"" related to consulting expenses with corporate restructurings. The other non-recurring results are allocated under the heading of ""general and administrative expenses"", ""cost of products sold"" and ""sales expenses"".
Annex I-39
c) explain why it believes that such a measurement is more appropriate for a correct understanding of its financial condition and the results of its operations
Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under Accounting Practices Adopted in Brazil and IFRS, nor should it be considered in isolation, or as an alternative to net income, as a measure of operating performance, or an alternative to operating cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.
Adjusted EBITDA has no standardized meaning and the Company's definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to that used by other companies. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA acts as a significant tool to periodically compare its operating performance, as well as to support certain administrative decisions. However, it should be noted that, since Adjusted EBITDA does not consider certain costs intrinsic to the Company's business, which could, in turn, significantly affect its profits, such as financial expenses, taxes, depreciation, capital expenditures and other corresponding charges, Adjusted EBITDA presents limitations that affect its use as an indicator of the Company's profitability.
In an overview, Adjusted EBITDA is additional information to our financial statements and should not be used to replace audited results, and may not be comparable with the same indicators disclosed by other companies.

Annex I-44
(iv) Total amounts spent by the issuer on the development of new products or services
In 2023, the Company incurred expenses with internal research and development, in the Parent Company of R$4,449 (R$1,425 thousand on December 31, 2022), and in the Consolidated of R$36,114. (R$42,922 on December 31, 2022).
d) opportunities embedded in the issuer's business plan related to ESG issues
On 2023, the Company continued fomenting ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) initiatives that provided opportunities in its business. Among them, the promotion of the circular economy, a strategic concept that aims to ensure the reduction, reuse, recovery and recycling of materials and energies, creating an economic cycle driven by the least possible disposal and waste. At JBS, this approach has given rise to new businesses for more than 15 years and to disruptive solutions that contribute to the Company's continuity of activities. A part of our business model, influencing long-term decision making, promoting a circular system that provides for the reuse and recycling of waste. A clear example of how the circular economy is applied in our business is in the cattle chain. Over the last two decades, we have developed a series of initiatives to give an adequate and sustainable destination, and with a focus to generate value to the waste from the process of animal protein production, such as tallow, skin and bovine serum. These by-products are transformed into biodiesel, collagen for the food and neutraceutics industry and soaps, contributing to the sustainable use of natural resources and benefiting the environment. This effort translates into large numbers, we are the world's largest verticalized producers of biodiesel from beef tallow. We also export to more than 40 countries another input, functional collagen, used in the food industry, with protein bases to serve different segments, such as sausages and breads. Another sector in which we operate is hygiene and cleaning products, in which we are leaders in the production of bar soaps in the B2B segment in Brazil, with 60% of the soap bars originating from beef tallow. We are also global leaders in the beef leather reuse segment - an activity that has as a positive social impact the generation of income for people in vulnerability situation. We are pioneers in Brazil to use organic waste generated in our factories to produce organic and organomineral fertilizers.
Through Biolins, a cogeneration unit, JBS also produces electricity and steam from biomass (sugarcane bagasse, eucalyptus chips and various biomass). With a processing potential of 600 thousand tons/year of raw material, it has a generation capacity of 45 megawatts hour (MW/h), a volume sufficient to supply a city of 300 thousand inhabitants. Biolins supplies 100% of electricity and steam to the Friboi, JBS Couros and JBS Novos Negócios factories in the Lins industrial park itself. Alone, the plant generates the equivalent of 16% of the total electrical energy used by all JBS units in Brazil. Finally, No Carbon, a new JBS business focused on renting electric trucks, began operations in 2022, providing logistical support to JBS's businesses in Brazil.
With an investment of R$54 million, JBS implemented in Brazil, in 2023, biodigester systems in nine Friboi facilities for the production of biogas, allowing the production of approximately 53 thousand m³/day of biogas, this is the largest project type in the protein industry in the country, reducing the environmental impact of its production process. Currently, 14 factories in the United States and Canada already have biodigester systems, producing 190 thousand m³/d of biogas. This clean energy powers boilers and is used to produce electricity in the Company's units, in addition to being sold to gas companies. Projects in operation in the USA and Canada reduced external demand for natural gas by 20%.
At JBS USA, nearly 100% of inedible by-products are destined for the production of tallow and blood-and-bone meal, which are sold to other companies for use in the manufacture of cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, and in animal feed.
The maturity of management within the scope of sustainability at JBS has gained market recognition. In 2021, the Company carried out four fundraisings linked to its sustainability goals (reduction in emissions and number of livestock farmers who joined the Transparent Livestock Platform), raising US$3.2 billion. Other ESG opportunities included in JBS' business plan are reported in the Company's Sustainability Report and HUB ESG.

 8.1. Compensation Practice or Policy
a) objectives of the compensation policy or practice, informing if the compensation policy was formally approved, the body responsible for its approval, approval date, and, if the issuer discloses the policy, the websites where the document can be found
The Company's compensation policy for its management, including members of the Board of Directors, Fiscal Council, and statutory and non-statutory directors, aims to attract and retain market professionals who have qualifications, skills and profile suited to JBS's practices and business.
Compensation is established based according to market research and is directly linked to the alignment of the interests of the executives with the interests of JBS. The Company's compensation policy is approved by its Board of Directors, as recommended by the Governance, Compensation and Nomination Committee and the variable compensation policy (PPR) is based on the agreement with the workers' union.
As part of the structure for monitoring executive compensation, JBS's Governance, Compensation and Nomination Committee analyzes, according to needs and demands, the evaluation metrics of management members.
The Company's current compensation guidelines were formally approved at the Board of Directors' Meeting on November 11, 2020. JBS' Compensation Policy is available for consultation on its website (https://ri.jbs.com.br/) and on the websites of the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission - CVM (www.cvm.gov.br) and B3 S.A. - Brasil, Bolsa Balcão (www.b3.com.br).
b) practices and procedures adopted by board of directors to determine the individual compensation of the board of directors and board of executive officers
(i) the issuer's bodies and committees that participate in the decision-making process and how they do so
The Statutory Audit Committee and the Company's Governance, Compensation and Nomination Committee submit to the Board of Directors a proposal for the overall annual compensation of its management. After approved by the Company's Board of Directors, the proposal is submitted for approval to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting. After approved by the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the overall annual management compensation is segregated by the Board of Directors among the members (Board of Directors and Statutory Board of Directors).
(ii) criteria and methodology used to establish individual remuneration, indicating if studies are used to verify market practices, and, if so, the comparison criteria and the scope of these studies
For fixed compensation, JBS analyzes market research carried out by specialized consultancy, including for annual inflation adjustment.
Just as for all the Company's employees, the performance indicators for executives are: achievement of operational and financial goals and individual performance of each executive.
(iii) frequency and how the board of directors assess the adequacy of the issuer's compensation policy
The Governance, Compensation and Nomination Committee, an advisory body to the Board of Directors, assesses the Company's compensation guidelines and practices, formulating recommendations to the Board of Directors and periodically reviewing the corporate governance policies and practices adopted by the Company. The Board of Directors, in turn, receives reports and recommendations from the Governance, Compensation and Nomination Committee, assesses and deliberates on suggestions for adjustments.

 Compensation is readjusted to inflation for the period, appreciation in share price (part of the variable compensation, as detailed below) and goals met, which is part of the performance evaluation process.
Furthermore, the fixed monthly compensation for the statutory and non-statutory directors is adjusted in all fiscal years, according to the percentages of the collective workers' agreements and other adjustments based on merit in the performance of their activities. Adjustments to compensation for the members of the Board of Directors, when they occur, are based on comparative market studies carried out by specialized consulting firms.
The variable compensation for the Company's directors considers the adjusted net income recorded by the Company, as well as an individual performance evaluation process, in the 360º model, which assessed behavioral performance and individual results.
The health plan offered by the Company to the members of the statutory board does not have a specific calculation and adjustment methodology, since it is determined by the insurance company.
Share-based compensation, which is granted to members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board, considers the evolution of the Company's share price and has its own calculation methodology, as described in the long-term variable compensation.
Annex III-3

The variable compensation for the Company's directors considers the adjusted net income recorded by the Company, as well as an individual performance evaluation process, in the 360º model, which assessed behavioral performance and individual results.

(iii) EBITDA; (iv) gross profit; (v) net revenue; and (vi) performance of the beneficiary's business unit. The company studies metrics linked to ESG matters to measure the performance of its leadership.
(ii) reasons to justify the compensation structure
Fixed compensation is in line with market practices and annual assessments based on research carried out by specialized consulting firms.

b) data and assumptions used in the pricing model, including the weighted average share price, strike price, expected volatility, option life, expected dividends and the risk- free interest rate

c) method adopted, and assumptions assumed to incorporate expected effects of early exercise
Not applicable

The unit value of the long-term incentive is calculated by the average of the last 30 (thirty) trading sessions prior to the date in which the Company published its annual results and is not influenced by the volatility of the share.
e) if any other option characteristic was incorporated into the measurement of its fair value
The Long-Term Variable Compensation is linked to the appreciation of JBS' shares, in the form of a unit value equivalent to a number of shares and no longer as share purchase options.

 Annex III-13
8.18. Compensation - other roles
The Company did not recognize in its results during the last 3 fiscal years, and there is no amount provisioned in the current fiscal year, of any other compensation other than the ones previously informed in item 8.2.
8.19. Remuneration recognized in the controlling/controlled company
Not applicable
8.20. Other relevant information
The Company submitted to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting, as a proposal for its annual and overall compensation for management and individual members of the Fiscal Council and the Statutory Audit Committee for the fiscal year of 2024, on an accrual basis, in the amount of up to R$269,342,164.59 (two hundred and sixty-nine million, three hundred and forty-two thousand, one hundred and sixty-four reais and fifty-nine cents). It is important to highlight, however, that this amount covers the compensation of independent members of the Statutory Audit Committee who are not members of the Company's Board of Directors and/or the Executive Board and/or Fiscal Council - so that the difference between (i) the value submitted to the shareholders' meeting and (ii) the expected compensation for the 2023 financial year indicated in item 8.2 above refers precisely to the compensation of the independent members of the Statutory Audit Committee.
Regarding the number of paid members of the Fiscal Council, indicated in item 8.2., the Company clarifies that one of the members of this body renounced his remuneration in 2023 and also for the 2024 fiscal year.
There is no other information deemed relevant by the Company to be disclosed in this section 8.
