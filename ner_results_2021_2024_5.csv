"{'Gomez, 22, of Providence, said he is on methadone and not using drugs. But I know a lot of people who are using, he said. So I have Narcan with me just in case.\r\nIn 2020, accidental overdose deaths reached record levels in Rhode Island. While its still awaiting toxicology reports and final tallies for October, November, and December, the state Department of Health had already recorded 359 accidental overdose deaths through September of last year surpassing the previous record of 336 set in 2016.\r\nJennifer Koziol, the Health Departments drug overdose prevention program administrator, said health officials dont know for certain why accidental overdoses have increased, but said it may be in part from the increasing toxicity of the drug supply. She said a wider variety of drugs are now laced with fentanyl, an extremely potent narcotic that can prove fatal in smaller doses than other opiates.\r\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated widespread loss of jobs is likely also a factor, Koziol said.\r\nIt is definitely exacerbating substance abuse disorders, she said. A lot of people who have been in long-term recovery, feeling solid in their recovery, are relapsing because of everything that is happening.\r\nKoziol said that between COVID-19 and the overdose crisis, Rhode Island finds itself in a syndemic, which she defined as two or more crises impacting a population simultaneously.\r\nYou cant address one without acknowledging the other, she said.\r\nAs part of its response, Rhode Island is using federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act funding to distribute 10,000 kits of naloxone, the overdose reversal medicine, through community organizations such as RICARES. Each kit contains two doses.\r\nGovernor Gina M. Raimondos Overdose Prevention and Intervention Task Force launched Rhode Islands 10,000 Chances Project earlier this month.\r\nWe are trying to saturate the community with naloxone, Koziol said. We are hoping we will see a reduction in overdose fatalities.\r\nThe state is also working with community nonprofits to increase street outreach work with certified peer recovery workers, she said.\r\nCommunity groups are targeting the states hardest hit areas, including Providence, Pawtucket, and Woonsocket, Koziol said. And theyre trying to get naloxone to vulnerable populations, such as people experiencing homelessness, and to the family members and friends of people with substance abuse disorders, she said.\r\nAny Rhode Island resident can get free naloxone delivered to them by going to the preventoverdoseri.org website. Naloxone is safe to use and only works if a person has opioids in their body. If you give naloxone to someone who is overdosing, you are protected by the states Good Samaritan Law and cannot be arrested, the website says.\r\nOn Thursday, Arene-Morley parked a 2006 Subaru Outback next to McAuley House, the Elmwood Avenue meal site and community center sponsored by the Sisters of Mercy, and he began distributing supplies from the rear hatch.\r\nAfter picking up food at McAuley, people formed a line behind the Subaru to receive draw-string bags filled with a pair of socks, a granola bar, and a face mask, along with naloxone kits and fentanyl test strips.\r\nArene-Morley said he has seen the toll taken by accidental overdose deaths up close.\r\nAlmost everyone that I talk to, almost everyone in Rhode Island whether they are a Brown University grad student or whether they are part of this (McAuley House) ministry they know someone who has been lost, he said. And at RICARES we have plenty of close friends who we dont have anymore.\r\nThe majority of the RICARES staff and board members are in long-term recovery from substance use disorder, he said.\r\nWe know that addiction is not really just an issue of the drug, its an issue of childhood trauma, an issue of the undiagnosed mental illness, an issue of systemic oppression in the criminal justice system that keeps people from getting to that next step, he said. So as people with lived experience, we help people go from step to step.\r\nThat help could be as simple as providing someone with a bus pass or as crucial as connecting people with a recovery program or primary-care doctor, he said.\r\nArene-Morley said overdose deaths had been rising even before the pandemic, but COVID-19 is making matters worse. People are losing their jobs, getting behind on the rent, and growing more anxious, he said. All of those are factors that are not helping, he said.\r\nAlso, he said fentanyl is being found not only in opioids but in cocaine, methamphetamines, and counterfeit benzodiazepines like Xanax. It is in almost every drug that people can buy on the street, he said. So that person may not have a problem, but they may still be in danger.\r\nThats why RICARES is distributing fentanyl test kits and naloxone.\r\nNo one thinks, Im going to need the naloxone tonight, Arene-Morley said. But people think Well, Ill test it, and give me the naloxone, why not? So its not a silver bullet, but it gets a foot in the door.\r\nHe said that about half of the people that he gave naloxone kits to on Thursday told him theyd used the medication before to save someone from an overdose.\r\nArene-Morley called for Rhode Island to adopt a more long-term solution by opening overdose prevention sites where people could use drugs under the supervision of health professionals.\r\nSenate Health and Human Services Committee Chairman Joshua Miller, a Cranston Democrat, has introduced a bill that would create an advisory committee and pilot program to establish such harm reduction centers. And Representative John G. Edwards, a Tiverton Democrat, has introduced a similar bill.\r\nArene-Morley said similar programs have proven successful in Canada and Europe. This is not a fringe thing, he said. We know that this is the way to reduce overdose deaths.\r\nHe also called for passing legislation to expand the Good Samaritan Law.\r\nMeanwhile, the focus is on keeping people alive amid the twin threats of the pandemic and the overdose crisis.\r\nOn Thursday, McAuley House case manager Shannon Rivers made sure that Gomez walked away with some food, a new pair of boots, and a tent.\r\nAnd Arene-Morley made sure Gomez left with a naloxone kit. He said RICARES hands out naloxone and basic supplies at McAuley House at lunchtime on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, and at the Mathewson Street Methodist Church in Providence on Sunday mornings.\r\nWith the overdose death toll rising in Rhode Island, it is crucial to get naloxone into as many hands as possible, Arene-Morley said.\r\nIts like a face mask now, he said. We all need to have it.\r\nEdward Fitzpatrick can be reached at edward.fitzpatrick@globe.com. Follow him on Twitter @FitzProv.': ""{{'PERSON': ['Gomez', 'Jennifer Koziol', 'Governor Gina M.

"{'The first wave of funding from multibillion dollar settlements with the opioid industry will go toward expanding treatment programs, increasing the availability of supportive housing for people with substance use disorders, reversing racial disparities in overdose deaths and providing relief for families devastated by the unrelenting opioid epidemic, according to a plan unveiled Friday by Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and the Boston Public Health Commission.\r\nThe new strategies include the creation of a Family Overdose Support Fund, which will provide financial support to Boston families who have lost a loved one to an opioid overdose. The fund will launch later this year with $250,000 to cover child care, funeral expenses, legal services, and other financial burdens faced by those with firsthand experience with the deadly scourge.\r\nThe grief and trauma of losing a loved one to overdose has a lasting impact on our communities, Wu said in a written statement. This fund will help support our families and our communities by easing the financial burdens that undermine a healthy grieving process.\r\nThe announcement culminates months of planning and deliberation by the Boston Public Health Commission, and comes as local and state governments nationwide struggle to reverse year after year of rising overdose fatalities. So far, Boston has collected $6 million through legal settlements from opioid manufacturers and distributors the most of any municipality in the state. Yet like many cities and towns across Massachusetts, Boston has not spent any of the money as it has grappled with how to address the public health disaster.\r\nApart from the new fund, the city did not lay out specific spending amounts for the other proposed investments.\r\nBoston, which ultimately expects to receive $22 million through 2038 from the legal settlements, has taken a deliberative approach to deploying the settlement funds, first seeking input directly from Boston residents and those directly affected by the overdose crisis. Since last summer, the commission has collected more than 400 submissions from an online survey and held eight listening sessions around Boston with more than 200 participants. A majority of respondents wanted to prioritize the needs of grieving families by providing direct financial support, the health commission said.\r\nThere is an overwhelming need to hold these drug manufacturers accountable, said Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, the executive director of the Boston Public Health Commission. And I think that, if allocated appropriately, these funds could help right tragic wrongs, they could save lives, and ... mitigate some of those ongoing harms.\r\nMassachusetts expects to receive almost $1 billion over 18 years from settlements with opioid manufacturers and distributors sued for their roles in the nations staggering toll of overdoses, which remain near record highs and claimed more than 2,300 lives in Massachusetts in 2022.\r\nForty percent of the money is being distributed among municipalities, with the dollar amount based on such factors as the number of opioid-related deaths and the amount of opioids flowing into that community, calculated by population. The remaining 60 percent is being deposited into the statewide Opioid Recovery and Remediation Fund, overseen by the state Executive Office of Health and Human Services.\r\nUnder an agreement, cities and towns that receive the settlement money must spend it on substance abuse prevention, treatment, recovery programs, support for pregnant women with opioid use disorder, as well as harm-reduction strategies that seek to reduce a drug users risk of getting sick or dying, among other strategies.\r\nMassachusetts is slated to receive another $90 million under a separate 2021 settlement deal with Purdue Pharma, producer of OxyContin; but that deal has been held up as the US Supreme Court weighs whether the companys former owners, the wealthy Sackler family, can be shielded from civil lawsuits under the terms of its bankruptcy deal.\r\nIn 2022, 352 people died from opioid overdoses in Boston, up nearly 7 percent from the previous year and more than quadruple the number from a decade ago. From 2019 to 2022, Boston experienced a 36 percent increase in opioid related deaths, more than twice the statewide rate of increase (16 percent) over the same time period. The crisis is disproportionately affecting Black and Hispanic people: Overdose fatalities among Black residents of Boston soared by 29 percent last year, according to state data.\r\nThe increase in overdose deaths has been propelled by the increasingly toxic illicit drug supply, the proliferation of the cheap and highly potent opioid fentanyl, which is deadly even in tiny amounts, and the mixing of opioids with stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine.\r\nOne of the reasons that it took us a long time ... to do this community engagement process is that we wanted to make sure that we were inclusive of communities that have been disproportionately impacted and sometimes left out, Ojikutu said. All of these things have made it so incredibly important that we also acknowledge their desires and needs.\r\nChris Serres can be reached at chris.serres@globe.com.

"{""Now, lawmakers led by Senators Maggie Hassan, Democrat from New Hampshire, and Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, who are joined by four members in the House are reintroducing legislation that would eliminate the rules and urging the president to support the bill, calling on Biden to 'deliver on your promise to expand access to medication-assisted treatment' in a letter shared with The Washington Post.\r\n'This burdensome requirement does not improve patient safety, but does lead to treatment bottlenecks and a lack of providers across the country, particularly in rural areas,' the lawmakers wrote Tuesday, adding that their legislation is the 'best way' to accomplish 'our shared goal.\r\n'We respectfully request that you prioritize the elimination of the X-waiver in order to deliver on your promise to expand access to medication-assisted treatment.'\r\nThe Biden administration is reviewing options to eliminate the waiver, said three administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it.\r\n'Were trying to do things the right way, and that will take some time,' one official said. 'We look forward to working with stakeholders on this issue, including Congress.'\r\n'As overdose deaths rise, its critical that the federal government find ways to expand access to lifesaving medications for opioid use disorder,' said a spokesman for the White House drug policy office. 'For its part, the Office of National Drug Control Policy will continue its efforts to identify the best ways to provide greater access for these medications, reduce overdoses, and save lives.'\r\nMedical groups have hailed buprenorphine as a lifesaving treatment, particularly as the opioid crisis has accelerated during the coronavirus pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that more than 81,000 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United States during the 12-month period ended in May 2020, the highest 12-month death count on record.\r\nPhysicians also have long clamored to be able to more easily prescribe the drug, which blocks the effects of opioids and limits the symptoms of withdrawal.\r\n'Perhaps the Biden administration will eliminate the X-waiver in its own manner. But how can it justify further delay with overdose deaths increasing amid the pandemic?' two Cleveland Clinic psychiatrists wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Monday. 'If the administration lacks the courage to act now, we implore Congress to do so.'\r\nThe Trump administrations plan to get rid of the X-waiver, announced Jan. 14, sought to go around Congresss requirement that physicians obtain a waiver by issuing new 'clinical guidelines' that would have enabled doctors with a Drug Enforcement Administration narcotics-prescribing license to avoid the training. But the plan had legal and operational problems, including a failure to receive necessary clearance from the White House budget office, said two officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter, and the Biden administration formally killed it in a terse 61-word announcement on Jan. 27.\r\nHassan and Murkowski had introduced their bill, the Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment Act, in the previous session of Congress, but it died in committee.

"{'A new and more powerful wave of overdoses is spreading rapidly across Massachusetts, and its putting severe pressure on front-line medical workers trying to save lives. In some cases, overdose victims are so heavily sedated on a toxic mix of substances that they can remain in a blackout stupor for hours. In other cases, victims overdose so quickly that theres not enough time to revive them.\r\nThese new and complex cases are confounding health agencies and leading front-line workers to rethink how they respond to overdoses. First responders are learning that even multiple sprays of naloxone, a drug effective at reversing most opioidoverdoses, are not enough to revive someone and can do more harm than good. So, outreach workers are deploying multiple tools and techniques, including pulse oximeters to check oxygen levels in the field, plastic mouth guards for mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, and test strips to help people identify the drugs they are taking before they use them.\r\nXylazine, a powerful animal tranquilizer used by veterinarians, is the chief culprit behind the prolonged overdoses.Known by the street names tranq or tranq dope, xylazine is not an opioid, which means that its effects cannot be reversed with naloxone, a medication also known by the brand name Narcan,that targets the brains opioid receptors. In the first quarter of this year, xylazine was detected in an alarming 49 percent of the states illicit drug supply, double the percentage from the same period last year, according to samples tested through Brandeis Universitys drug-checking program.\r\nDoctors and first responders say its particularly challenging to rouse a person sedated with xylazine. Some victims pass out and do not move for several hours, which can be especially dangerous if they are alone or outside in the extreme cold, say street outreach workers. It also renders users especially vulnerable to rape and robbery. In addition to causing breathing and heart rates to drop, xylazine injections havebeen linked to severe skin wounds. The sedative is increasingly being mixed into street drugs such as fentanyl and heroin that can be injected, snorted, or inhaled.\r\nPeople are so heavily sedated [from xylazine] that theyre not responding in ways you would expect from an overdose, said Jessie Gaeta, a physician and former medical director at the nonprofit Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program.\r\nThe hard-to-reverse overdoses also reflect a broader shift in drug-using habits among those struggling with addiction, say health researchers. More people are mixing opioids with stimulants like cocaine and antianxiety medications such as benzodiazepines (known as benzos), a practice known as polysubstance use. In many cases, people are taking multiple drugs to counteract their different side effects, or to prolong the experience, say addiction treatment specialists.\r\nMany of these drugs are now laced with fentanyl, a fast-acting andhighly potent synthetic opioid that is lethal even in tiny amounts. Fentanyl has become a leading cause of death in the United States and has been driving the relentless death toll from overdoses across New England. In 2022, overdose fatalities in Massachusetts reached 2,359 the highest on record.While highly effective, naloxone is sometimes not enough to contend with the speed at which people overdose on fentanyl, which moves through the system much faster than other opioids. With fentanyl, breathing can stop within several minutes, compared with up to an hour with heroin, researchers have found.\r\nWe used to have minutes to an hour to respond to overdoses, said Traci Green, an epidemiologist and director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative at Brandeis University. Now we have seconds to minutes.\r\nDerrick Cormier, 50, a recovering addict and former warehouse worker from Worcester, recalled nearly dying from xylazine-laced heroin last summer. He injected a small amount of the mixture in a park and then passed out for several hours, before waking drenched in sweat and shaking with abdominal pain. Days later, he developed black-and-purple flesh wounds on his arms a sign that he had injected tranq dope.\r\nTranq is everywhere, and its pure poison, said Cormier, who said the incident led him to seek counseling for his drug use. The stuff thats out there ... just a little bit can knock you out for hours.\r\nIn many cases, simply spraying Narcan, the over-the-counter nasal spray that contains naloxone,into a victims nose and calling 911 is no longer enough.\r\nFirst responders are now stressing the importance of ensuring that a person who has overdosed has adequate oxygen, to reduce the risk they will die or suffer brain damage. They recommend making sure the persons airway is clear and providing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, also known as rescue breathing, after administering Narcan and while waiting for rescue crews to arrive.\r\nHarm reduction groups are also distributing more plastic mouth guards for mouth-to-mouth resuscitation as well as drug-testing supplies, including paper strips that can be dipped into drugs to detect if they contain fentanyl or xylazine. People who discover fentanyl using the strips are more likely to take steps to reduce the risks of a deadly overdose, such as slowing their intake or using with someone else present, studies have found.\r\nHaving an unregulated drug supply presents us with a constant challenge, said Eliza Wheeler, co-director of Remedy Alliance/For the People, a national network of harm-reduction programs based in Berkeley, Calif., that distributes naloxone. We are learning as we go as harm reductionists sometimes blindly.\r\nFor a time, it was widely believed that giving multiple doses of naloxone was necessary if someone didnt immediately start breathing again after an overdose. But too much of the overdose-reversal drug can send someone into severe withdrawal, and possibly reduce their willingness to carry the life-saving drug, say harm-reduction specialists and health researchers.\r\nA study released this month by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that a higher-dose nasal spray for reversing opioid overdoses did not save more lives than the previous standard dose, but it did cause more withdrawal symptoms, including vomiting and disorientation.\r\nIn the past, people had this mentality that the only goal in these situations was to reverse the overdose, said Allyson Pinkhover, director of substance use services atBrockton Neighborhood Health Center. But there is actually a two-fold goal: You have to reverse the overdose, but you have to do it in a way that doesnt cause unnecessary pain and suffering.\r\nAs director of the states overdose prevention hot line, Stephen Murray has a rare, inside look at evolving drug use patterns.\r\nThe frequent mixing of drugs poses challenges for operators of the state helpline, which has trained staff tomonitor people by telephone while they use drugs. Even if someone says they are using a stimulant such as cocaine, Murray noted, operators track the persons speech pattern to detect if the drug is laced with a potentially lethal opioid. Someone who suddenly becomes drowsy or less talkative on the helpline could have taken cocaine laced with fentanyl, he noted.\r\nIn the past, treatment professionals often would ask people seeking help for addictions to identify their so-called drug of choice, so they could tailor therapies based on the symptoms. Now, that question has become less relevant, he said, because people are routinely using several different types of drugs. Very rarely is substance use just about using one substance, Murray said.\r\nOutreach workers at the Brockton Neighborhood Health Centers mobile unit have kept expanding the number of tools they carry in response to growing intensity of the overdoses they encounter. They are now equipped with pulse oximeters to track victims blood-oxygen levels, CPR face shields, and naloxone. People can also bring samples of their drugs to the mobile unit to have them checked for fentanyl and other toxic substances.\r\nOn a frigid weekday morning, the medical trailer pulled into a parking lot behind the Universal Missionary Church in Brockton. Within minutes, a line of people a couple of themclutching drug samples to be checked formed outside the vans window. Each interaction was a fresh opportunity for outreach workers to hand out harm-reduction supplies and to educate visitors about the increasingly contaminated drug supply. Often, visitors pass along the information they glean from the drug tests to their peers so they know what to avoid, she noted.\r\nKnowledge is power, Pinkhover said. The same people we are trying to save are the ones who are saving others.\r\nChris Serres can be reached at chris.serres@globe.com.

"{'McKinseys extensive work with Purdue included advising it to focus on selling lucrative high-dose pills, the documents show, even after the drugmaker pleaded guilty in 2007 to federal criminal charges that it had misled doctors and regulators about OxyContins risks. The firm also worked with a number of opioid-makers to band together to defend against strict treatment by the Food and Drug Administration.\r\nMcKinsey will not admit wrongdoing in the settlement, to be filed in state courts on Thursday, but it will agree to court-ordered restrictions on its work with some types of addictive narcotics, according to those familiar with the arrangement. McKinsey will also retain emails for five years and disclose potential conflicts of interest when bidding for state contracts. And, in a move similar to the tobacco industry settlements decades ago, it will put tens of thousands of pages of documents related to its opioid-related work onto a publicly available database.\r\nStates will use the civil penalties $478 million of which must be paid within 60 days for opioid treatment, prevention and recovery programs, the people said. It will be the first money states will see after Purdue Pharma in October agreed to plead guilty to federal criminal charges over its marketing of OxyContin and to pay $8.3 billion. Purdue declared bankruptcy, meaning the states party to that agreement will have to line up with other creditors.\r\nThe amount McKinsey is paying is also substantially more than it earned from opioid-related work with Purdue or Johnson &amp; Johnson, Endo International and Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, the other opioid-makers that McKinsey worked with, according to one of the people. In contrast, members of the Sackler family, which owns Purdue Pharma, agreed to pay $225 million in civil penalties, only a small fraction of the billions they drew from Purdue over the years.\r\nMany states were dissatisfied with the October deal, which the Trump administrations Department of Justice reached only days before the former president was defeated in Novembers election.\r\nA spokesman for McKinsey did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\r\nFor decades, McKinsey has successfully kept a distance between the advice it gives companies and the consequences of those companies actually acting on it. The consultants only make recommendations, but the decision to act on that advice is entirely up to the client, McKinsey has said.\r\nOne former McKinsey partner called the settlement hugely significant because it shatters the distance McKinsey puts between its advice and its clients actions. In the past, McKinsey avoided legal liability for high-profile failures of some clients, including the energy company Enron. The former partner asked for anonymity because former McKinsey employees are bound by confidentiality agreements.\r\nMaking McKinsey and its competitors even more vulnerable is the fact that in recent years they have aggressively moved into a new line of work, not only offering management advice but also helping companies implement their suggestions.\r\nThe McKinsey materials released in litigation over the last two years go back as far as 2004 and are as recent as 2019.\r\nThe records highlight McKinseys close relationship with Purdue over many years. In 2009, the firm wrote a report for Purdue saying that new sales tactics would increase sales of OxyContin by as much as $400 million annually and suggested sales drivers based on the idea that opioids reduce stress and make patients more optimistic and less isolated, according to a lawsuit filed in 2018 by Massachusetts. McKinsey worked with Purdue executives in finding ways to counter the emotional messages from mothers with teenagers that overdosed on the drug.\r\nIn 2013, the federal government reached a settlement with Walgreens, the pharmacy chain, to crack down on illegal opioid prescriptions. Sales to Walgreens began to fall. According to the Massachusetts lawsuit, McKinsey recommended that Purdue lobby Walgreens leaders to loosen up.\r\nIn a 2017 slide presentation, McKinsey laid out several options to shore up sales. One was to give Purdues distributors a rebate for every OxyContin overdose attributable to pills they sold. The slides are notable for their granular detail. For example, McKinsey estimated 2,484 CVS customers would overdose or develop an opioid use disorder in 2019 from taking OxyContin. CVS said the plan was never implemented.\r\nBy 2018, senior executives at McKinsey were becoming aware that they might face liability for their work with Purdue. After Massachusetts sued Purdue, Martin Elling, a leader in the firms pharmaceutical practice, wrote to another partner, Arnab Ghatak: It probably makes sense to have a quick conversation with the risk committee to see if we should be doing anything other than eliminating all our documents and emails. Suspect not but as things get tougher there someone might turn to us.\r\nBoth men were put on administrative leave pending the results of an investigation by an outside forensic investigation into whether any material was destroyed, McKinseys North America managing partner, Liz Hilton Segel, said in a letter to Congress in December. That month, McKinsey issued a rare public apology for its work on opioids.\r\nAs we look back at our client service during the opioid crisis, we recognize that we did not adequately acknowledge the epidemic unfolding in our communities or the terrible impact of opioid abuse and addiction on millions of families across the country, the company said in a statement. The firm subsequently changed the statement to read misuse instead of abuse.\r\nThe agreement with the 47 states Nevada, Washington and West Virginia werent party to it doesnt preclude the Biden administration from also seeking legal action against McKinsey. Additionally, several counties and cities across the country including Mingo County in West Virginia, one of the states hardest hit by the opioid crisis have sued McKinsey in recent days.\r\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.': ""{{'PERSON': ['McKinsey', 'Purdue', 'Johnson & Johnson', 'Endo International', 'Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals', 'Sackler family', 'Martin Elling', 'Arnab Ghatak', 'Liz Hilton Segel'], 'DATE': ['2007', 'Thursday', '60 days', 'October', 'Novembers', '2004', '2019', '2009', '2013', '2017', '2018', 'December'], 'LOC': ['Massachusetts'], 'ORG': ['Food and Drug Administration', 'Purdue Pharma', 'Department of Justice', 'Enron', 'Walgreens', 'CVS', 'Congress', 'The New York Times'], 'PROGRAMS': ['opioid treatment, prevention and recovery programs'], 'IMPACT': ['$478 million for opioid treatment, prevention and recovery programs', 'increase sales of OxyContin by $400 million annually', 'Purdue lobby Walgreens leaders to loosen up', 'give Purdue’s distributors a rebate for every OxyContin overdose']}}""}"
"{'A pair of recent developments could substantially boost the nations capacity to deal with the opioid crisis. CVS and Walgreens will pay over $10 billion to settle charges against them for over dispensing opioids; this will add to the $3 billion agreed to by Walmart and would bring the current sum of expected settlements to over $54 billion.\r\nIn addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revised its 6-year-old guidelines on how to prescribe these medications, adding expanded advice on the need to carefully taper these drugs in patients who are dependent on them, rather than shutting off the prescriptions (or the patients) abruptly. These recommendations would help move the countrys struggle against addictive substances further beyond Nancy Reagans unhelpful Just Say No To Drugs vision of the 1980s. The older CDC recommendations had strongly warned doctors about the risks of narcotic painkillers, but simplistic application of the guidance sometimes precipitated acute withdrawal symptoms, limited pain control for sick patients, and increased the risk of death by forcing some people to switch to street drugs, raising their chance of overdose. The revised guidelines take a more nuanced approach to lowering unnecessary opioid use while avoiding the downsides of ham-handed restrictive policies.\r\nThese new developments could be creatively combined to reduce the misprescribing of opioids and provide better care to patients in pain. As things stand, most doctors will never even see the new CDC guidelines since the government doesnt actively disseminate its messages the way drug companies do. And our profession will continue to underuse buprenorphine, a safe and effective treatment that can wean opioid users from addiction. New reforms last year made it much easier for doctors to prescribe bupe, and more legislation could be in the works to make that even easier. But few practitioners understand the complexities of how to use it and many dont know about the key rule change that made this life-saving medicine much more accessible to doctors and our patients.\r\nIts now clear that a major cause of the opioid epidemic was the unscrupulous but very effective marketing of these addictive drugs to doctors by companies like Purdue Pharma, which sent their sales reps (known as detailers)to our offices to make promotional pitches that overstated benefits and lied about risks. For several years, my colleagues and I have been using that tool in reverse, sending health care professionals to physicians offices to market non-biased information about many kinds of medications. The approach was developed in the 1980s and dubbed academic detailing. Such programs have been shown to work well in randomized trials; their application to the opioid crisis is a particularly good fit, since each doctor comes to these prescribing decisions with different attitudes, knowledge, and biases.\r\nDealing with that is best addressed when a nurse or pharmacist outreach educator engages in an interactive one-on-one conversation with a physician, as pharmaceutical sales reps do for their own purposes, rather than just sending out a copy of guidelines or a threatening memo. The drug companies know this works to change practice; thats why they spend over $5 billion each year on their own detailing programs. De-marketing programs like the kind weve developed for the opioid crisis are now supported by funding from federal agencies like the CDC, Pennsylvania and other states, the Veterans Affairs health system, and the health insurer Aetna, among others. Eighteen years ago, my colleagues and I set up a nonprofit called Alosa Health that accepts no pharmaceutical funding and offers such evidence-based outreach on many topics in primary care; its named after the genus of fish that swim upstream, like herring.\r\nThe billions in opioid settlement dollars that are now starting to flow will be used for many pressing needs: rehabilitation of patients with addiction, reimbursing programs like Medicaid that spent millions of scarce dollars on drugs like Purdues OxyContin that were marketed under false pretenses, and other worthy causes. But as the massive settlement funds roll in, at least a small proportion ought to support such nonprofit re-education programs for health care professionals. That could help more doctors access the detailed clinical information we need to offer safer, evidence-based pain treatment that is not addictive and to deploy available, effective tools to help patients who have become opioid-dependent.\r\nThe knowledge base we doctors need to combat the opioid crisis is out there, but spreading the implementation of these strategies will require a boost from a delivery system that proactively transmits them to front-line practitioners who need all the help they can get in managing these tough clinical problems. And as the salespeople at Purdue Pharma knew all too well, recommendations on what to prescribe dont just disseminate themselves.\r\nDr. Jerry Avorn is a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.': ""{'PERSON': ['Vivian Peng', 'Nancy Reagan', 'Dr. Jerry Avorn'], 'DATE': ['None'], 'LOC': ['NY'], 'ORG': ['CVS', 'Walgreens', 'Walmart', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Purdue Pharma', 'Alosa Health', 'Harvard Medical School', 'Veterans Affairs health system', 'Aetna'], 'PROGRAMS': ['resource hub', 'academic detailing'], 'IMPACT': ['boost the nations capacity to deal with the opioid crisis', 'provide better care to patients in pain', 'reduce the misprescribing of opioids', 'offer safer, evidence-based pain treatment']}""}"
"{'MEXICO CITY High-level delegations from Mexico and the United States were at work Friday on building a new security framework for the bilateral relationship that they hope will govern how the two countries cooperate on a broad range of issues.\r\nThe so-called US-Mexico Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health, and Safe Communities seeks to move beyond the 13-year-old Merida Initiative that focused on building Mexicos crime-fighting capabilities and rule of law projects.\r\nIts time for a comprehensive approach to our security cooperation, one that will see us as equal partners in defining our shared priorities, tackle the root drivers of these challenges like inequity, like corruption, and focus not only on strengthening law enforcement, but also public health, the rule of law, inclusive economic opportunities, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday.\r\nMexico Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard put it more succinctly: Goodbye Merida, Bicentennial agreement.\r\nThe two governments joint declaration devoted considerable space to treating drug addiction especially opioids and its societal effects in the public health context, a significant departure from Meridas emphasis on the criminal justice system.\r\nThe US pledged to devote more resources to identify and treat people affected by opioids and Mexico committed to working with the United Nations to launch a program to better manage shipping containers to limit the importation of chemical precursors for synthetic drugs like fentanyl.\r\nMexico seized an estimated 1.3 tons of the synthetic opioid last year. That same year, the US recorded 93,000 drug overdose deaths.\r\nThe governments committed to targeting importers of chemical precursors for fentanyl and methamphetamine, their financial networks and secret labs.\r\nThey also said they would work together to reduce the trafficking of guns, a high priority for violence-wracked Mexico, and to provide more opportunities to youth to make it harder for criminal organizations to recruit them.\r\nWe need to deal with the violence, dismantle the transnational criminal organizations, and focus on prevention with the goal of creating the conditions for a culture of peace, while we work hand-in-hand to address the fundamental causes of crime, the joint statement said.\r\nMexicos Public Safety Secretary, Rose Icela Rodríguez Velázquez said, for many years, the issue of Mexicos security has been addressed from the point of view that its only measured by the use of force, now we are combatting the causes that originate that violence with social programs, intelligence and coordination, listening to men and women in their towns, their municipalities and communities.\r\nImmigration is expected to be a key topic of the dialogue. López Obrador has been saying for months that Mexico cannot continue to simply detain migrants and try to contain them in the southern part of the country, far from the US border.\r\nHe has asked the US government to invest in two of his signature social programs to relieve some of the economic pressure people feel to migrate. The Biden administration needs Mexicos continued cooperation to manage the flow of migrants to the US border.\r\nThe US also must find a way to re-instate the controversial Trump-era policy that made asylum seekers wait out their cases in Mexico. Under the so-called Migrant Protection Protocols, tens of thousands of asylum seekers waited in dangerous Mexican border cities for their cases to advance. Biden had made cancelling the policy one of his first orders of business upon taking office, but the Supreme Court ordered that it be implemented again.\r\nMexico has also been pressing for the US government to do more to stop illegal guns from pouring in from the US. The guns fuel Mexicos organized crime violence, creating a public safety issue that López Obradors government has been unable to adequately address.\r\nBoth sides are also expected to discuss the role of US agents in Mexico and intelligence sharing. The governments insist that their security agencies work closely on a daily basis. But following the United States arrest of former Mexican Defense Secretary Salvador Cienfuegos, then his release after Mexicos loud protests, tensions have remained.\r\nCienfuegos was arrested after he was secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in New York in 2019. He was accused of conspiring with the H-2 cartel to smuggle thousands of kilos of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and marijuana while he was defense secretary from 2012 to 2018.\r\nWith Cienfuegos back, Mexico said it would perform its own investigation, but it was quickly closed. López Obrador attacked US prosecutors case against the general and accused the Drug Enforcement Administration of fabricating the case.\r\nMexico restricted US agents working in the country and lifted their diplomatic immunity.\r\nAt a breakfast with both delegations Friday, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said it would be very unfortunate if we didnt understand each other, if our cooperation, the friendship between our governments and our peoples wasnt strengthened.': ""{'PERSON': ['Antony Blinken', 'Marcelo Ebrard', 'Rose Icela Rodríguez Velázquez', 'Salvador Cienfuegos', 'Andrés Manuel López Obrador'], 'DATE': ['Friday'], 'LOC': ['MEXICO CITY', 'United States', 'Mexico', 'New York'], 'ORG': ['Merida Initiative', 'United Nations'], 'PROGRAMS': ['US-Mexico Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health, and Safe Communities', 'Merida Initiative', 'Migrant Protection Protocols'], 'IMPACT': ['cooperate on a broad range of issues', 'tackle the root drivers of these challenges like inequity, like corruption', 'strengthening law enforcement, public health, the rule of law, inclusive economic opportunities', 'treating drug addiction especially opioids and its societal effects in the public health context', 'identify and treat people affected by opioids', 'manage shipping containers to limit the importation of chemical precursors for synthetic drugs', 'working hand-in-hand to address the fundamental causes of crime', 'combatting the causes that originate that violence with social programs, intelligence and coordination']}""}"
"{'Its a step in the right direction because not doing this would be negligent, said Adam Wandt, an associate professor of public policy at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. If this is a diplomatic option that we did not take, every fentanyl death over the next decade would be on our heads.\r\nBut he and others described the steps as necessary in addressing the overdose crisis in the U.S. but not sufficient.\r\nWandt said the steps should reduce the amount of fentanyl in the U.S., though when that happens depends on how much of the chemicals are already in possession of Mexican cartels. And even if fentanyl is eradicated, he said, they will switch to another drug, which I predict will be even more lethal.\r\nKevin Roy, the chief public policy officer at Shatterproof, a national group dedicated to combatting the addiction and overdose crisis, said that the steps announced were crucial, but they still have to be carried out.\r\nIts only one part of a bigger picture, Roy said.\r\nHe was also concerned that the nations did not reach any agreements on how to deal with laundering drug money through China, an issue that Rahul Gupta, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, identified at a congressional hearing this year as another major problem.\r\nChinas National Narcotics Control Commission issued a directive Friday citing existing laws on narcotics and customs controls as a reminder to logistics businesses in the country on preventing the shipment of narcotics and psychotropic drugs abroad.\r\nThe notice called on businesses and companies to be cautious about orders from the United States and Mexico and be wary of the exported items being used to manufacture drugs. It also warned businesses of the risk of getting caught up in law enforcement actions abroad.\r\nThe Biden administration confirmed Thursday that as part of the arrangement, it was lifting trade sanctions against the Chinese Ministry of Public Securitys Institute of Forensic Science.\r\nState Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the continued listing of the institute, known as IFS, was a barrier to sealing Chinese cooperation on the issue.\r\nUltimately we decided that given the steps China was willing to take to cut down on precursor trafficking, it was an appropriate step to take, Miller said.\r\nThe U.S. Commerce Department listed the institute in 2020, saying it was complicit in human rights violations and abuses committed in Chinas campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, forced labor and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups.\r\nFentanyl emerged as a widespread problem in the U.S. about a decade ago as there were crackdowns on prescribing opioid painkillers, which were linked to soaring death numbers already.\r\nIn the early days, it was largely shipped from China to the U.S., easily concealed in envelopes and small packages. Fentanyls potency makes it appealing to drug suppliers because its easy to ship. And because its made from chemicals in labs, it doesnt rely on growing crops for drugs such as heroin, cocaine or marijuana.\r\nPushed by then-President Donald Trump, China agreed in late 2018 to crack down on shipments of finished fentanyl and some of its precursors. After that, more production moved to Mexico with the raw materials still coming largely from China.\r\nSynthetic opioids are now the biggest killers in the deadliest drug crisis the U.S. has ever seen. In 2014, nearly 50,000 deaths in the U.S. were linked to drug overdoses of all kinds. By last year, the total was more than 100,000, according to a tally by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than two-thirds of those deaths more than 200 per day involved fentanyl or similar synthetic drugs.\r\nThe powerful drugs are showing up in different places in the nations supply of illicit substances. Its in counterfeit pills and cocaine, in some cases causing overdoses in people who have no idea that theyre using fentanyl. Its also sought out by some people with opioid use disorder. In many areas of the country, its mostly replaced the supply of heroin.\r\nXi said at a dinner Wednesday in San Francisco, China sympathizes deeply with the American people, especially the young, for the sufferings that fentanyl has inflicted upon them.\r\nBiden said of the agreement, Its going to save lives, and I appreciate President Xis commitment on this issue.""\r\nThe tone has changed from earlier this year. In April, Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry criticized the U.S. for blaming China for the precursors, saying theyre ordinary chemicals sold through normal trade. And China blasted the U.S. over the summer for imposing sanctions on Chinese anti-drug efforts rather than praising their efforts.\r\nA key part of the new announcement from China is that it is sharing information on the drug trade. It\'s resumed submitting information to the International Narcotics Control Board for the first time in three years and agreed to launch a counternarcotics working group with the U.S.\r\nAs we know only too well, the supply piece of this is just one part and were not going to solve the fentanyl overdose issue solely by reducing the supply, said Regina LaBelle, who directs the Addiction and Public Policy Initiative at Georgetown Universitys ONeill Institute and served as acting director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President Biden.\r\nShe said that it\'s significant that China and the U.S. are dealing with fentanyl, but it\'s an issue that demands cooperation from other countries, too. Xi was meeting Thursday with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador and Biden was scheduled to meet with him Friday.\r\nThe rise of fentanyl across the U.S. has intensified efforts to reduce the danger. Naloxone, a drug that reverses overdoses, has become more widely available, including without prescriptions. A growing number of places are allowing drug screening kits so users can find out if their drugs include fentanyl. Harm reduction groups also preach that people using drugs should use a small amount first to test for adverse effects and that they should not use alone.\r\nWere making investments in the United States in addressing prevention, treatment, recovery and harm reduction, LaBelle said. All of those things have to continue to be ramped up.': ""{{'PERSON': ['Adam Wandt', 'Kevin Roy', 'Rahul Gupta', 'Matthew Miller', 'Donald Trump', 'Xi', 'President Xis', 'Wang Wenbin', 'Regina LaBelle', 'Andrés Manuel López Obrador', 'President Biden'], 'DATE': ['Thursday', 'Friday', 'late 2018', 'In 2014', 'By last year', 'In April', 'first time in three years', 'Wednesday', 'this year', 'over the summer'], 'LOC': ['U.S.', 'Mexico', 'China', 'Chinese', 'United States'], 'ORG': ['John Jay College of Criminal Justice', 'Shatterproof', 'Office of National Drug Control Policy', 'Chinas National Narcotics Control Commission', 'Chinese Ministry of Public Securitys Institute of Forensic Science', 'State Department', 'U.S. Commerce Department', 'Uighurs', 'U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Chinese Foreign Ministry', 'International Narcotics Control Board', 'Addiction and Public Policy Initiative at Georgetown Universitys ONeill Institute'], 'PROGRAMS': ['the steps', 'the new announcement', 'counternarcotics working group'], 'IMPACT': ['should reduce the amount of fentanyl', 'ultimately we decided', 'Fentanyl emerged as a widespread problem', 'the total was more than 100,000', 'its going to save lives', 'were making investments in the United States in addressing prevention, treatment, recovery and harm reduction']}}""}"
"{'Pierre Poilievre, Conservative leader, posted his video Everything feels broken, which features him criticizing the status quo on dealing with overdose issues.Handout\r\nA former public safety and justice adviser to Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper has condemned Pierre Poilievres new video on Vancouvers toxic drug crisis, describing the current party leaders opposition to safe supply as unsubstantiated.\r\nI was really disgusted by it. I honestly was so disturbed to see Pierre Poilievre using peoples really desperate situation here in the city I live in as a backdrop for a political propaganda ad, said Benjamin Perrin, a law professor at the University of British Columbia, in an interview on Monday.\r\nMr. Perrin was referring to a post Sunday titled, Everything feels broken, which features Mr. Poilievre criticizing the status quo on dealing with overdose issues particularly Vancouvers approach of safe supply, or providing drugs that are not contaminated with toxic opioids, to those grappling with addiction.\r\nIt was a five-minute long diatribe thats not informed by any research evidence or expertise. Its just Mr. Poilievre rehashing Conservative, war-on-drugs tropes that have been long since discredited and have been found to be not only ineffective but costly and deadly.\r\nAccording to a report this month from BC Coroners Service, at least 171 people died from toxic drugs in September, amounting to 1,644 fatalities thus far this year. That monthly figure is an 8-per-cent increase over the number of deaths in September, 2021.\r\nPrior to working for Mr. Harper from 2012 to 2013, Mr. Perrin was a law clerk at Canadas Supreme Court. He now teaches criminal and international law, and is the author of several books, including Overdose: Heartbreak and Hope in Canadas Opioid Crisis, published in 2020.\r\nHe also took issue with Mr. Poilievre posting the footage without meeting the media to talk about his policy.\r\nPoliticians should be courageous enough to answer questions when they are going to propose that they have got solutions to a problem as complex and diverse as the opioid crisis instead of just posting a video on their social-media channels and just walking away without being responsible for what they said.\r\nMeanwhile, British Columbias Mental Health and Addictions Minister accused Mr. Poilievre of spreading a dangerous message with his video.\r\nIn a statement, Sheila Malcolmson cited the finding from the recent BC Coroners Service that the vast majority of toxic drug deaths in the province are due to people using illicit substances alone.\r\nPeople hide their drug use due to stigma and shame which is why the message the leader of the Federal Conservative party is perpetuating is dangerous, Ms. Malcolmson said.\r\nOne of the most important ways to save lives from toxic drugs is to separate people from toxic drugs thats why B.C. prescribes safer supply and is the first province in Canada to do this. Its toxic, illicit drugs that are killing people not the provinces prescribed safer supply program.\r\nMr. Poilievres video features him sitting on a downtown Vancouver beach with a tent community behind him.\r\nIn that tent city are people hopelessly addicted to drugs, putting poisons in their bodies, he says.\r\nAs the footage shifts to images of the Downtown Eastside, Mr. Poilievre cites escalating overdose deaths in the province, saying they have soared since Justin Trudeau became Prime Minister in 2015.\r\nHe calls the addictions part of a failed experiment, describing a deliberate policy by woke Liberal and NDP governments to provide taxpayer-funded drugs, flood our street with easy access to these poisons.\r\nHe says Conservatives support increasing resources on Canadas borders to keep precursor ingredients used to make the drugs out of the country, as well as bringing in tougher laws for violent reoffenders and criminal actors preying on those with addiction issues. He adds that he opposes the so-called and ironically named safe-supply approach: There is no safe supply of these drugs.\r\nMr. Perrin criticized Mr. Poilievres suggestion that the crisis is caused by taxpayer-supported drugs as false, attributing the problem instead to street drugs contaminated with the potent opioids fentanyl and carfentanyl.\r\nThere is no indication that prescribed safe supply is contributing to illicit drug deaths, Mr. Perrin said, citing the recent BC Coroners Service report.\r\nSafer supply has been tested and found to be beneficial for people who have been unable to have treatment for whatever reason, and are long-term substance-abuse users. Were talking about essentially substituting a contaminated street drug with a drug that has known contents and potency to help people stay alive, first of all, and also to be able to stabilize.\r\nB.C. introduced prescribed safer supply in May, 2020 and expanded it in July, 2021 with more than 14,000 people from March 2020 to June, 2022 prescribed safer supply medications, include opioids, stimulants and benzodiazepines, and more than 10,000 of those prescribed an opioid, according to a statement from Ms. Malcolmsons ministry.\r\nCarolyn Bennett, the federal Mental Health and Addictions Minister said in a statement that theres a need for a multi-faceted approach to the toxic drug crisis that uses prevention, harm reduction, treatment and enforcement. Safer supply, she said, can reduce hospitalizations, prevent ER visits and save lives.\r\nThe Harper government removed the harm reduction pillar based upon ideology instead of science. We are now continuing to work hard to save lives after those failed policies. Because there is no recovery model for people who are dead. Instead, Mr. Poilievre wants to take Canada back to them, Ms. Bennett said.': ""{'PERSON': ['Pierre Poilievre', 'Stephen Harper', 'Benjamin Perrin', 'Sheila Malcolmson', 'Justin Trudeau', 'Carolyn Bennett'], 'DATE': ['Monday', 'September', '2021', '2012 to 2013', '2020', 'May, 2020', 'July, 2021', 'March 2020 to June, 2022', '2015'], 'LOC': ['Vancouver', 'University of British Columbia', 'Canadas', 'British Columbia', 'Canada', 'Downtown Eastside'], 'ORG': ['Conservative', 'BC Coroners Service', 'Supreme Court', 'Federal Conservative party', 'NDP', 'Ms. Malcolmsons ministry'], 'PROGRAMS': ['safe supply', 'prescribed safer supply', 'safer-supply approach', 'treatment'], 'IMPACT': ['171 people died from toxic drugs in September', '1,644 fatalities thus far this year', '8-per-cent increase over the number of deaths in September, 2021', 'prescribes safer supply', 'taxpayer-funded drugs', 'increase resources on Canadas borders', 'tougher laws for violent reoffenders and criminal actors', 'prescribed safe supply is not contributing to illicit drug deaths', 'reducing hospitalizations', 'preventing ER visits', 'saving lives']}""}"

LINDSEY:\r\nIT ACKNOWLEDGES SOME OF THE\r\nHARDEST HIT INDUSTRIES IN THE\r\nECONOMY HAD BEEN IMPROVING\r\nALTHOUGH COVID CASES REMAIN\r\nELEVATED.\r\nTHIS IS THE WIGGLE ROOM THE FED\r\nPROVIDED ITSELF.\r\nTHE ECONOMY IS TAKING\r\nSUBSTANTIAL STEPS IN THE RIGHT\r\nDIRECTION, BUT IF SOMETHING\r\nGOES WRONG THE FED HAS NOT\r\nCOMMITTED TO A NOVEMBER\r\nTIMELINE.\r\nTHE FED COULD EXTEND THAT OUT\r\nTO THE END OF THE YEAR OR THE\r\nBEGINNING OF THE YEAR IF WE SEE\r\nTHE DELTA VARIANT OR ANOTHER\r\nVARIANT REAR ITS HEAD AND START\r\nTO CAUSE DISRUPTIONS TO THE\r\nECONOMIC PROCESS WE HAVE\r\nALREADY SEEN.\r\nTHE FED HAS NOT LOCK THEMSELVES\r\nINTO A CORNER AND HAS NOT\r\nCOMMITTED TO A NOVEMBER OR\r\nDECEMBER TIMELINE.\r\nBASED ON THE EXPECTATIONS ON\r\nWHAT WE HAVE SEEN AND WHAT THE\r\nFED ANTICIPATES, THEY DO THINK\r\nTHAT TAPER PROCESS WILL BE\r\nAPPROPRIATE TO INITIATE IN THE\r\nCOMING WEEKS. DAVID:\r\nWHAT DID WE LEARN ABOUT THE FED\r\nPERSPECTIVE ON THE LABOR MARKET.\r\nWE HAVE THIS ANOMALY OF A LOT\r\nOF JOB OPENINGS COME AT THE\r\nSAME TIME ON EMPLOYMENT\r\nRELATIVELY ELEVATED.\r\nWORRY PROJECTING ABOUT WHEN WE\r\nGET BACK TOWARDS FULL\r\nEMPLOYMENT? LINDSEY:\r\nTHE FED CHAIRMAN WAS ACTUALLY\r\nVERY CANDID DURING THE PRESS\r\nCONFERENCE.\r\nHE SAID WE HAVE MET OUR MANDATE\r\nON THE INFLATION SIDE BUT HE\r\nSAID WE\'VE ALSO MET THE MANDATE\r\nON THE LABOR MARKET FRONT.\r\nHE DID SAY OPINIONS VARY AMONG\r\nCOMMITTEE MEMBERS, BUT FROM HIS\r\nPERSPECTIVE MEETING THAT\r\nTHRESHOLD OF MAXIMUM EMPLOYMENT\r\nHAD BEEN MET WITH THE PROGRESS\r\nWE HAD SEEN.\r\n5.2% UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, VERY\r\nMUCH WITHIN WHAT THE FED LOOK\r\nFOR IN TERMS OF THAT RANGE.\r\nFROM THE CHAIRMAN\'S PERSPECTIVE\r\nWE\'VE BEEN ABLE TO CHECK BOTH\r\nBOXES. DAVID:\r\nTHANK YOU VERY MUCH.\r\nLINDSEY PIEGZA.\r\nCOMING UP, THE WHITE HOUSE\r\nKEEPS UP THE PRESSURE ON SUPPLY\r\nCHAIN ISSUES.\r\nWE TALK WITH BINDIYA VAKIL.\r\nTHIS IS ""BALANCE OF POWER""\r\nGUY:\r\n-- DAVID: THIS IS ""BALANCE OF\r\nPOWER.""\r\nFOR FIRST WORD NEWS WE GO TO\r\nMARK CRUMPTON.

BIL THEL U.S.\r\nCHINA RELATIONSHIP IS:\r\nIN A DIFFICULT PLACE.\r\nYOU HAVE THIS INABILITY OF\r\nPRESIDENT XI AND PRESIDENT\r\nBIDEN TO FIND A TIME TO MEET\r\nANYWHERE.\r\nWE ARE NOT EXPECTING THAT TO BE\r\nHAPPENING SOON.\r\nYOU HAVE WHAT WE CONTINUE TO\r\nSEE AT THE U.S. THIS WEEK.\r\nIN GENERAL IN THE RELATIONSHIP\r\nTHERE IS A SENSE ALL OF THESE\r\nISSUES HAVE TO BE TAKEN\r\nTOGETHER.\r\nCHINA IS NOT INTERESTED IN\r\nTALKING ABOUT CLIMATE IF YOU\'RE\r\nNOT TALKING ABOUT TRADE. DAVID:\r\nYOU SAY THEY CANNOT FIND TIME\r\nIN THEIR CALENDARS TO MEET.\r\nHOW MUCH OF IT IS THAT AND HOW\r\nMUCH IS IT THEY CANNOT FIND\r\nMUCH TO TALK ABOUT.\r\nI\'M NOT SURE WITH THE BIDEN\r\nPOLICY IS.\r\nDOES PRESIDENT XI KNOW WHAT IT\r\nIS? BILL:\r\nIT IS NOT CLEAR THERE IS A\r\nCLEAR POLICY.\r\nWE SAW TALKS BETWEEN HIGH-LEVEL\r\nOFFICIALS IN FEBRUARY IN ALASKA.\r\nTHOSE NEGOTIATIONS WENT POORLY\r\nAND WE HAVE NOT SEEN HIGH-LEVEL\r\nTALKS TAKE PLACE SINCE. DAVID:\r\nAT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE A LOT\r\nOF PROBLEMS WITH SHIPPING AND\r\nSHIPPING CONTAINERS.\r\nWHERE DOES THAT STAND RIGHT NOW?\r\nI UNDERSTAND THERE\'S A LOT OF\r\nCONGESTION BUT THERE IS A LOT\r\nOF EMPTY CONTAINERS IN THE\r\nUNITED STATES BECAUSE WE DO NOT\r\nHAVE ANYTHING SHIPPED TO CHINA.\r\nBILL:\r\nWE HAVE ALWAYS RUN THE DEFICIT\r\nWITH CHINA ON THAT ISSUE.\r\nWE ARE SEEING SPIKES OF COVID\r\nAND SPORADIC SHUTDOWNS.\r\nTHAT IS SOMETHING THE WHITE\r\nHOUSE WANTS TO GET ON TOP OF\r\nWHEN IT MEETS WITH COMPANIES IN\r\nTERMS OF SAYING WE NEED MORE\r\nHEADS UP WHEN TRADE\r\nINTERRUPTIONS ARE COMING. DAVID:\r\nMAKE SENSE.\r\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH TO BILL\r\nFARIES. TO GIVE US THE LATEST ON\r\nPROBLEMS WITH THE SUPPLY CHAIN\r\nWE WELCOME BINDIYA VAKIL,\r\nFOUNDER AND CEO OF RESILINC.\r\nGREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US.\r\nLET\'S START WITH SEMICONDUCTORS.\r\nTHAT IS WITH THE WHITE HOUSE IS\r\nMOVING ON TODAY.\r\nWHERE ARE WE WITH\r\nSEMICONDUCTORS? BINDIYA:\r\nTHE SEMICONDUCTOR SUPPLY CHAIN\r\nCONTINUES TO BE DISRUPTED.\r\nWE ARE NOT SEEING ANY END IN\r\nSIGHT IN THE NEAR TERM.\r\nWE EXPECT THIS TO CONTINUE INTO\r\n2023. COMPANIES WHO ARE ENTIRELY\r\nRELIANT ON SEMICONDUCTORS\r\n-- ESSENTIALLY FOR THE LONG\r\nTERM. DAVID:\r\nIS THE REASON WHY THIS WILL\r\nWORK ITS WAY OUT IN TWO OR\r\nTHREE YEARS BECAUSE WE ARE\r\nDOING SOMETHING TO FIX IT OR IT\r\nJUST HAS TO WORK ITS WAY OUT?\r\nARE WE DOING ANYTHING TO HELP\r\nTHE SITUATION? BINDIYA:\r\nTHE SITUATION HAS BEEN A LONG\r\nTIME BUILDING AND SO THERE IS\r\nNO TERM -- THE CAPACITY HAS THE\r\nCAPACITY AND IT TAKES SEVERAL\r\nYEARS TO BRING IT UP TO WHERE\r\nIT NEEDS TO GO.\r\nRIGHT NOW WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS\r\nDEMAND FOR SEMICONDUCTORS\r\nCOMING OUT HARD AND FAST FROM\r\nMANY DIFFERENT WAYS.\r\nLOOK AT THE PROLIFERATION OF\r\nDEVICES LIKE AIRPODS WHICH\r\nAPPLE WANTS TO SELL AT HIGH\r\nVOLUME.\r\nALL OF THE WEARABLES ARE NOW\r\nUSING SEMICONDUCTORS.\r\nTHERE IS SO MUCH INCREDIBLE\r\nDEMAND FOR THESE DEVICES THAT\r\nTHE CAPACITY -- DAVID: THE\r\nWHITE HOUSE MEETING IS MAINLY\r\nINFORMATION SHARING.\r\nIT IS NOT THE WHITE HOUSE\r\nSAYING WE WILL DIRECT THE\r\nSUPPLY CHAIN.\r\nHOW MUCH CAN BE HELPED BY\r\nUP-TO-DATE AND ACCURATE\r\nINFORMATION, SOMETHING THAT\r\nRESILINC IS VERY MUCH INVOLVED\r\nIN? BINDIYA:\r\nWE HAVE BEEN WORKING IN SUPPLY\r\nCHAIN TRANSPARENCY FOR THE LAST\r\nDECADE AND I PERSONALLY HAVE\r\nBEEN DOING THIS FOR FAR LONGER\r\nTHAN THAT.\r\nI WILL SAY THERE IS SO MUCH\r\nWORK TO BE DONE.\r\nSUPPLY CHAIN PARTNERS ARE NOT\r\nTRANSPARENT WITH EACH OTHER.\r\nTHEY\'RE NOT WILLING TO SHARE\r\nINFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THEY\r\nBUILD THE PARTS COMPANIES BUY\r\nFROM THEM, WHO ARE THE\r\nSUPPLIERS AND THAT SUPPLY\r\nCHAIN, AND IN PARTICULAR IN\r\nSEMICONDUCTORS IT IS A BIG\r\nPROBLEM BECAUSE THERE IS SO\r\nMANY SMALLER PLAYERS, IT IS A\r\nDIAMOND-SHAPED SUPPLY CHAIN.\r\nTHE MOMENT YOU LOOK AT THE\r\nSUPPLIERS SUPPLIERS YOU LOOK AT\r\nA FEW SMALL, HIGHLY DOMINANT\r\nPLAYERS.\r\nIT IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT\r\nTOPIC THAT THERE WAS MORE\r\nTRANSPARENCY.\r\nDAVID:\r\nTHERE IS THE SEMICONDUCTOR\r\nPROBLEM, BUT THERE A LOT OF\r\nOTHER SUPPLY PROBLEMS. THINGS\r\nLIKE THE PORTS BEING CONGESTED\r\nAND SHIPPING CONTAINERS.\r\nGIVE US A SENSE OF WHERE WE ALL\r\nOVERALL IT OTHER SUPPLY CHAINS.\r\nBINDIYA:\r\nIS A PERFECT STORM RIGHT NOW.\r\nEVERY AREA YOU CAN THINK OF YOU\r\nFIND SOME LEVEL OF DESTRUCTION.\r\nIF PORTS KINSHIP FROM CHINA\r\nWHERE THEY DID SHUT DOWN GAS\r\nFOR A PERIOD OF TIME DUE TO\r\nCOVID CASES, BUT NOT JUST CHINA.\r\nWE SAW THE SAME ISSUES IN\r\nMALAYSIA.\r\nSHIPS THAT WERE STUCK THERE\r\nCAME BACK.\r\nIN PARALLEL WE HAD DEMAND\r\nBECAUSE OF COMPANIES TRYING TO\r\nFILL HOLIDAY SEASON.\r\nTHEN WE HAVE THE STIMULUS\r\nRELATED DEMAND ITSELF AND PANIC\r\nBUYING. ALL OF THIS HAS CAUSED A\r\nPERFECT STORM WHERE EVERYONE IS\r\nTRYING TO STORE AS MUCH AS THEY\r\nCAN IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN DOES\r\nNOT SCALE UP LIKE THAT.\r\nWE ALSO HAVE RAILCAR ISSUES.\r\nWE HAVE TRUCK DRIVER SHORTAGES.\r\nIT IS NOT JUST A CONTAINER\r\nSHORTAGES.\r\nTHERE ARE BOTTLENECKS IN THE\r\nSUPPLY CHAIN IN EVERY STEP OF\r\nTHE PROCESS. DAVID:\r\nLET ME CONNECT THIS TO WHAT WE\r\nHEARD FROM JAY POWELL YESTERDAY.\r\nWE HEARD SOME OF THE\r\nINFLATIONARY PHENOMENON WE ARE\r\nSEEING ARE TRANSITORY.\r\nSOME OF THEM ARE BECAUSE OF\r\nSUPPLY CHAIN PROBLEMS. IF IT\r\nTAKES TWO YEARS TO FIX THE\r\nSUPPLY CHAIN, THAT DOES NOT\r\nFEEL TRANSITORY.\r\nHOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO GET\r\nTHIS FIXED? BINDIYA:\r\nWE TRACKED ABOUT 30 COMMODITIES\r\nAND OUT OF 30 ABOUT 19 ARE\r\nSHOWING CONSISTENT INFLATIONARY\r\nTRENDS.\r\nWE ARE NOT PROJECTING THESE\r\nPRICES STABILIZING IN THE NEXT\r\nSIX MONTHS.

THIS YEAR GAINED 34%.\r\nIF THE STOCK CAN SUSTAIN THAT\r\nIT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST ADVANCE\r\nDURING THAT STREAK.\r\nDARDEN HAS FIGURED A FEW THINGS\r\nOUT AND THE SHAREHOLDERS HAVE\r\nBEEN THE BENEFICIARIES.

"{'WASHINGTON Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra outlined the Biden administrations strategy for curbing drug overdoses Wednesday, committing more federal support for harm reduction techniques like distribution of clean syringes and test strips used to check street drugs for hidden fentanyl.\r\nThe four-part strategy also includes measures to prevent drug addiction, in part by continuing to reduce the inappropriate prescribing of opioids; expand medication-based treatment, which research has shown to be the most effective approach; and improve support for people recovering from substance use disorder.\r\nWith the estimated number of overdose deaths soaring toward 100,000 per year, Becerra said in an interview Tuesday that were changing the way we do this. He added: We know what works. Weve had years of evidence now.\r\nFrom 1999 to 2019, an HHS report released Wednesday notes, 840,000 people died of drug overdoses. By some estimates, there have been 20 to 30 times as many nonfatal overdoses.\r\nPresident Biden campaigned on a major expansion of drug use prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts. Much of what Becerra announced Wednesday, including harm reduction efforts, was contained in a statement of priorities for the administrations first year released in March by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy.\r\nThough some officials oppose it, many experts consider harm reduction a more promising approach than prosecution of drug users or the many failed campaigns to keep drugs from coming into the United States. But it is also a measure of how dire the overdose crisis has become: Fentanyl has so thoroughly infiltrated the illegal drug supply that users often cannot be sure what they are consuming, and the government must act simply to keep them alive and disease-free.\r\nWe really are seeing something weve never seen before, said Jon Zibbell, a senior public health scientist at the think tank RTI International who studies street drug use.\r\nBecerra said the federal government would spend more to expand the distribution of naloxone, the antidote to opioid overdoses, although there is a shortage of the drug currently; fund programs where drug users can exchange used syringes for clean ones, to reduce needle sharing that transmits infections such as HIV and hepatitis C; and distribute test strips that allow users to determine if the powerful opioid fentanyl has been laced into cocaine, methamphetamine, and counterfeit pills.\r\nAsked whether the government would allow supervised consumption sites, the most controversial facet of harm reduction, where people are monitored while using drugs, Becerra said: When it comes to harm reduction, we are looking for every way to do that. . . . We probably will support the efforts of states that are using evidence-based practices and therapies.\r\nBecerra noted that the decision was outside his lane, but as Californias attorney general, he was a supporter of the facilities, where drug users are monitored by staff or volunteers equipped with naloxone and oxygen to respond to overdoses. Some offer referral to treatment and other services to substance abusers.\r\nWidespread in Canada and Europe, the sites are credited with saving many thousands of lives of people who accidentally overdose; no one has ever died in one of the oldest and best-known supervised sites in Vancouver. But some experts and officials believe the facilities encourage drug use and attract drug users to the sites.\r\nUnder the Trump administration, the Justice Department went to court and defeated a nonprofit groups attempt to open such a site in Philadelphia. Any change in government policy would be a major shift in approach. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. The White House did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday.\r\nJurisdictions including Rhode Island, New York City, Massachusetts, and California are preparing to open such sites, hoping the Biden administration will refrain from cracking down as the drug epidemic grows more critical.\r\nWere looking for innovative ways to address the drug epidemic, said Alex Kral, an epidemiologist with RTI International. If the federal government is finally indicating support for these sites, we can finally see if they are equally helpful in the US as they are around the world.\r\nThe HHS plan also calls for expanding the number of doctors who can prescribe the treatment drug buprenorphine by surmounting rules that require hours of training for those caregivers. It calls for reducing the stigma surrounding substance use disorder that keeps people from seeking treatment. Polls show that many Americans still consider addiction a personal failing or weakness rather than a disease. And the plan acknowledges the need to maximize health equity for disproportionately affected populations as an essential component of each priority area, objective, and activity.': ""{'PERSON': ['Xavier Becerra', 'President Biden', 'Jon Zibbell', 'Alex Kral'], 'DATE': ['Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'From 1999 to 2019'], 'LOC': ['WASHINGTON', 'United States', 'Canada', 'Europe', 'Vancouver', 'Philadelphia', 'Rhode Island', 'New York City', 'Massachusetts', 'California'], 'ORG': ['Health and Human Services', 'White House Office of National Drug Control Policy', 'RTI International', 'Justice Department'], 'PROGRAMS': ['new resource hub', 'harm reduction techniques', 'prevent drug addiction', 'expand medication-based treatment', 'improve support for people recovering', 'distribution of naloxone', 'exchange used syringes for clean ones', 'distribute test strips'], 'IMPACT': ['reducing the inappropriate prescribing of opioids', 'improve support for people recovering', 'soaring towards 100,000 deaths per year', '840,000 people died of drug overdoses', 'reduce needle sharing that transmits infections', 'saving many thousands of lives of people who accidentally overdose', 'encourage drug use and attract drug users', 'address the drug epidemic', 'reduce the stigma surrounding substance use disorder', 'maximize health equity for disproportionately affected populations']}""}"
"{'Healthy habits like exercising, getting good sleep, and drinking in moderation could pay off not just in quality of life, but in length of life, too.Thats according to new research presented Monday at the American Society for Nutritions annual conference in Boston, Mass.\r\nResearchers examined the data of nearly 720,000 military veterans ages 40-99, who were followed over time. Those who adopted eight healthy habits saw a 13% reduction in mortality compared to those who did not.\r\nForty-year-olds who adopt all eight healthy habits could gain between 23 (for women) and 24 (for men) years of life expectancy, according to the research team, mostly comprised of Harvard- and Department of Veterans Affairs-affiliated scientists in Boston.\r\nThe benefits of positive lifestyle tweaks were only studied among veterans, Xuan-Mai Nguyena medical student at the Carle Illinois College of Medicine in Champaign, Ill., and a researcher on the studytells Fortune. But it makes sense that they would benefit civilians as well.\r\nThese lifestyle factors are not new ideas, and for the general population to incorporate them into their lifestyle could promote general wellbeing, she says.\r\nSo, just what are the eight healthy habits that apparently extended the lifespan of hundreds of thousands of veterans?\r\n<ol><li>Never smoking: Life expectancy for smokers is at least 10 years shorter than it is for nonsmokers, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The good news: If you quit smoking before age 40, you can reduce the risk of dying from a smoking-related disease by about 90%.</li><li>Being physically active: In the study, those who got 30 minutes or more of moderate or vigorous physical activity a day were considered to be physically active. Such people should be able to walk up a flight of stairs without getting winded, according to Nguyen.</li><li>Not regularly binge drinking: Study participants whose peak daily alcoholic beverages consumption in the past month was four drinks or less were not considered to be binge drinkers. Those who consumed five or more drinks in one day on their heaviest drinking day in the past month were considered to be binge drinkers.</li><li>Getting good sleep: Participants who got, on average, seven to nine hours of sleep a night and didnt suffer from insomnia were considered to have good sleep. Insomnia was defined as having one or more of the following symptoms: difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, and/or early-morning awakenings, along with sleep that isnt refreshing or excessive daytime sleepiness.</li><li>Eating a healthy diet: Those who generally adhered to a plant-based diet were considered to have a healthy diet.</li><li>Living a minimal-stress life: Chronic stress advances ones biological (or epigenetic) clock, potentially shortening their lifespan, according to a 2021 Yale-based study. Thankfully, relaxing can set that clock in reverse.</li><li>Having positive social relationships: Loneliness is a greater risk factor for early death than obesity and physical inactivity, comparable to the risk associated with smoking and drinking, some studies have found. In fact, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy declared loneliness a public health epidemic this year. When it came to the study, participants were considered to have positive social relationships if they had someone to talk to, hug, or otherwise interact with at least 50% of the time.</li><li>Avoiding opioids: U.S. opioid deaths hit a record high in 2021, according to federal data, seemingly fueled by pandemic isolation. Those who use opioids like hydrocodone, fentanyl, and oxycodone for more than two weeks are at risk for addiction. Medications exist to treat those with opioid use disorders, and to make quitting more bearable. But theyre not always readily accessible, according to a White House fact sheet.</li></ol>The three most impactful habits when it came to extending lifespan: exercising, not being addicted to opioids, and not smoking. Those who didnt have these healthy habits were 30%-45% more likely to die during the study.\r\nStress, binge drinking, poor diet, and not getting good sleep were associated with around a 20% increase of death during the study. A lack of positive social relationships added a 5% increased risk of death.\r\nWhile adopting all eight factors by age 40 is ideal, adopting even oneor a fewat any point in life helps, researchers say. A 60-year-old with all eight healthy habits could expect to see just under 20 years gain, and an 80-year-old around 10 years. A 40-year-old with just four of the healthy habits saw about a 10-year increase in life expectancy, and an 80-year-old around five years.\r\nThe earlier the better, but even if you only make a small change in your 40s, 50s, or 60s, it is still beneficial, Nguyen says.': ""{'PERSON': ['Xuan-Mai Nguyen', 'Dr. Vivek Murthy'], 'DATE': ['Monday', '2021'], 'LOC': ['Boston', 'Mass.', 'Champaign, Ill.'], 'ORG': ['American Society for Nutritions', 'Harvard', 'Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Carle Illinois College of Medicine', 'U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Yale', 'White House'], 'PROGRAMS': ['None'], 'IMPACT': ['Those who adopted eight healthy habits saw a 13% reduction in mortality compared to those who did not', 'Forty-year-olds who adopt all eight healthy habits could gain between 23 (for women) and 24 (for men) years of life expectancy', 'Those who didnt have these healthy habits were 30%-45% more likely to die during the study', 'Stress, binge drinking, poor diet, and not getting good sleep were associated with around a 20% increase of death during the study.']}""}"
"{""You're reading Part 1 of The War on Recovery, a yearlong investigation into how the U.S. denies lifesaving medications to people with opioid addiction.\r\nPart 2 coming March 12\r\nThe opioid overdose epidemic has burned through the U.S. for nearly 30 years. Yet for all that time, the country has had tools that are highly effective at preventing overdose deaths: methadone and buprenorphine.\r\nThese medicines are cheap and easy to distribute. People who take them use illicit drugs at far lower rates, and are at far lower risk of overdose or death. By beating back the cravings and agonizing withdrawal symptoms that result from trying to quit opioids cold turkey, methadone and buprenorphine can help people addicted to opioids escape an existence defined by drugs and achieve stable, healthy lives.\xa0\r\nBut a yearlong investigation by STAT shows that virtually every sector of American society is obstructing the use of medications that could prevent tens of thousands of deaths each year. Increasingly, public health experts and even government officials cast the countrys singular failure to prevent overdose deaths not as an unavoidable tragedy but as a conscious choice.\r\nNarcotics Anonymous, a nationwide organization that promotes the 12-step model of addiction recovery, actively opposes the use of medication, leading would-be participants like Mark Palinski, 38, to be banned from chapter meetings in North Carolina after disclosing that he had been prescribed buprenorphine. Hundreds of jails and prisons bar their use even when prescribed by a doctor, forcing people like Amanda Cassidy-Trejo, 41, to suffer weeks of agonizing withdrawal in a San Antonio jail cell. Even specialized methadone clinics, which otherwise support the use of medications, can make them all but impossible to access, requiring patients like Rebecca Smith, 65, to show up daily at her Detroit clinic to swallow a single dose a rule that forced her to quit her job.\r\nFew doctors prescribe buprenorphine (commonly known by the brand name Suboxone). Roughly 40% of Walmart, Rite Aid, and CVS pharmacy locations decline to stock it. Many rehab facilities and sober living houses refuse to admit people taking either medication. Federal regulations often prevent truck drivers and pilots from taking methadone or buprenorphine. In many cases, state medical boards even prevent doctors and nurses in recovery from taking the same medications theyd provide to patients seeking treatment for opioid addiction.\xa0\r\nThough overdose death rates have climbed steadily for the past two decades, researchers estimate that barely one-fifth of the approximately 2.5 million Americans with opioid use disorder receive medication and tens of thousands have died for lack of it.\r\nMore than 80,000 people are dying of opioid overdose every year, and yet we have a tool, medication-assisted treatment, that we know dramatically reduces overdose deaths, said David Frank, a medical sociologist at New York University who takes methadone for opioid addiction. But because its so difficult to access, people that could and should be alive continue to die.\r\nSTATs examination of the overdose epidemic is based on hundreds of interviews with patients, doctors, policy experts, lawmakers, scientists, and other major figures in drug policy and addiction medicine. It relies on an exhaustive review of legal documents, tax filings, financial disclosures, patient records, lobbying reports, and peer-reviewed academic research. And it includes a first-of-its-kind analysis of the ownership and practices of Americas roughly 2,000 methadone clinics, detailing for the first time how private equity firms have acquired a major stake in the nations addiction-treatment infrastructure while opposing calls for reform.\r\nMethadone and buprenorphine have one major drawback: They are themselves opioids, a fact that opponents have used to cast the medications as no better than illicit drugs sold on a street corner. Indeed, they are not perfect: Methadone, which is sometimes used to treat pain, can cause sedation or even overdose if used improperly. Buprenorphine, while far safer, can also cause complications when used in combination with alcohol or other drugs. Amid a broad push to increase access to addiction medications, some experts have argued for proceeding with caution.\r\nWe need to continue to improve access, but we need to do it in a way that maintains quality and safety, said Kenneth Stoller, an addiction psychiatrist and researcher at Johns Hopkins University. If were expanding access by just flooding the streets with a medication that we know is easily misused, and when misused is dangerous, thats a problem as well.\r\nBut both medications are far less potent than the illicit substances whose use they are meant to prevent, like heroin or fentanyl. And they are the gold standard for addiction treatment.\xa0\r\nPeople genuinely have no idea how effective these medications are at preventing people from dying.\r\nAyana Jordan, NYU Langone Health\r\nIn an interview, Nora Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, estimated that if methadone and buprenorphine were made universally available nationwide, opioid overdoses would fall by half, if not more.\xa0\r\nWe have these very effective medications, and the question is why are they not being implemented, she said. I estimate that we would have at least 50% less people dying, and thats conservative. I think it would probably be much more consequential.\r\nYet instead of providing people with pharmaceuticals known to treat their condition, in the United States, common approaches to treating opioid addiction still include undergoing painful and ineffective detox; 12-step approaches like Narcotics Anonymous; or even equine therapy, a form of treatment that centers on spending time with horses.\xa0\r\nWhile such programs often rely heavily on hope, mindfulness, and religion, they often ignore the physiological realities of addiction in particular, the debilitating withdrawal that occurs when regular opioid users attempt to suddenly stop. In any other medical field, favoring prayer over proven medication would be considered malpractice. Yet for addiction treatment in the U.S., its simply the way things work.\r\nThere is a core belief, thats different from other countries, that people with opioid addiction dont deserve care in the way that somebody who has cancer or diabetes does, said Ayana Jordan, a researcher and addiction psychiatrist at NYU Langone Health. People genuinely have no idea how effective these medications are at preventing people from dying.\r\nNot changing one drug for another\r\nThe evidence supporting the use of methadone and buprenorphine is overwhelming. According to NIDA, patients using methadone and buprenorphine are 59% and 38% less likely, respectively, to die of an opioid overdose compared to those not receiving medication. Other data show an even greater effect: One recent study demonstrated an overall 80% drop in opioid overdose deaths among people taking either medication. A separate study showed that incarcerated people taking methadone or buprenorphine were 80% less likely to die of overdose in the first month after being released. The World Health Organization lists both medications on its model list of essential medicines, citing a strong evidence base for their use.\r\nThe medications have remarkable secondary effects, too. People being treated with methadone or buprenorphine are vastly less likely to be diagnosed with HIV, hepatitis C, endocarditis, and other diseases that can be transmitted via drug injection. Both medications are also associated with a marked decrease in depression symptoms.\r\nWhile methadone and buprenorphine are opioids, they bear little resemblance to the substances that cause the vast majority of opioid overdoses namely heroin and fentanyl. Methadone is extremely slow-acting, making it a poor option for people seeking opioids euphoric effects. Buprenorphine is known as a partial agonist, meaning it only partly binds to the receptor that provides a high when stimulated by other opioids. Practically speaking, buprenorphine only has one true use: treating opioid addiction.\r\nA third medication, Vivitrol, has been embraced as a treatment for opioid addiction by many judges, prisons, and some doctors specifically because, though it reduces opioid cravings, it is not an opioid. A recent analysis shows that people who take Vivitrol which costs as much as $2,100 per monthly dose may in fact overdose at higher rates than people taking buprenorphine.\r\nDespite the medications remarkable effectiveness, the countrys view of buprenorphine and methadone is built largely on myths and stigma. In 2017, Tom Price, then health secretary to President Trump, referred to what is called medication-assisted treatment as just substituting one opioid for another. Law enforcement agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration, while widely criticized for allowing the proliferation of OxyContin and other painkillers that fueled the opioid epidemic in the 1990s and 2000s, now forcefully regulate buprenorphine and methadone, even as illicit fentanyl floods the market.\r\nThey are not changing one drug for another, said Volkow, who has led the federal governments $1.6 billion addiction research institute since 2003. Theyre not different from other medications you may need to take, like antihypertensive medications or antidiabetic medications. They allow for your physiology to be normalized, which is necessary to achieve recovery.\r\ngo deeper\r\nHow to save lives, plus the agonies of opioid withdrawal\r\n<ul><li>Read a Q&amp;A with Nora Volkow, the nation's top addiction researcher, about how thousands of lives could be saved.</li><li>Watch STAT's deep dive into how withdrawal, particularly from potent opioids like fentanyl, affects the body and brain.</li><li>Meet Nora Volkowat a discussion of addiction and GLP-1 drugs at STAT's Breakthrough Summit East on March 21 in New York.</li><li>Join Lev Facherat a virtual live event about the War on Recovery on Tuesday, March 12, at 1 p.m. on STAT+ Connect, a service for STAT subscribers.\xa0</li></ul>\r\nStill, in much of the U.S., the prevailing attitude remains that achieving sobriety by using medications does not constitute true recovery. Even medication-assisted treatment, long a common term in the field, betrays an embedded stigma: That the medication itself is not a treatment, but a supplement. Many addiction doctors now prefer a new term: medications for opioid use disorder.\r\nIn many peoples minds, the only route to beating opioid addiction is to simply stop using, experience days or weeks of agonizing withdrawal, and never use opioids again even if those opioids are highly regulated medications prescribed for the purpose of treating addiction. Doctors, however, say the approach fails for nearly everyone who tries it, especially in the age of highly potent illicit fentanyl.\r\nThe people that come to me to seek treatment with medication have basically all tried to stop using without medication, said Zoe Weinstein, a doctor who serves as the director of Boston Medical Centers addiction consult service and medical director of a methadone clinic. There are a lot of people who need medication, and many more people who want medication than are able to access it.\r\nAndi Hüttenmoser, a peer support specialist at Arud Centre for Addiction Medicine, picks up his prescription at the clinics location in Zurich, Switzerland, in August 2023. Hüttenmoser and several other Arud employees are in recovery themselves, and now work to help other patients seeking addiction treatment.\xa0Djamila Grossman for STAT\r\nThats how nuts this is\r\nThe U.S. laws and practices governing addiction medicine are not just out of step with the latest science they are also out of step with laws in most of the Western world.\r\nAt Arud, a substance use clinic in Zurich, Switzerland, patients receiving addiction medications are free to come and go as they please. They pick up weeks worth of methadone, and other powerful addiction drugs, at a pharmacy, and are not forced to undergo drug testing or regular counseling sessions as a condition of receiving their medication. While American law enforcement officials and methadone industry representatives have warned that easier access could increase methadone misuse and even overdose, Switzerlands results have been the opposite. There, and throughout Western and Central Europe, countries that have increased addiction medications availability have consistently seen overdose deaths and infectious disease transmission plummet to rates vastly lower than in the United States.\r\nWe have a precedent in France, said Volkow, the NIDA director. What the French did was basically provide buprenorphine to every single person that needed it. And you see this dramatic reduction in overdoses they basically stopped.\r\nFor decades, American physicians needed to obtain a special license known as the X-waiver just to prescribe buprenorphine. As of 2021, just 75,000 of the nations roughly 1.1 million physicians had obtained the waiver. The Biden administration effectively eliminated that requirement in early 2021, but according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the overall buprenorphine prescribing rate nonetheless decreased from 2021 to 2022.\r\nMethadone, which is widely accessible across Europe, is available in the U.S. only at specialized clinics known as opioid treatment programs, or OTPs. These clinics typically require patients to report in person each day to receive a single dose, forcing them to structure their lives around the clinics dosing schedule.\r\nThis is practically the only medication in the entire country that is treated this way, said Rep. Don Norcross (D-N.J.), who has co-authored legislation that would allow specialized addiction doctors to prescribe methadone directly to patients. The medication for abortion that is easier accessed than methadone. Thats how nuts this is. The idea that the only way to do this is to go to the methadone clinic is just insane.\r\nThe medication for abortion that is easier accessed than methadone. Thats how nuts this is. The idea that the only way to do this is to go to the methadone clinic is just insane.\r\nRep. Don Norcross (D-N.J.)\r\nThe difficulty of accessing addiction medications, and the stigma that many Americans still attach to them, have deadly consequences. Studies consistently show that patients who do not take medication return to illegal drugs, overdose, or die at far higher rates than patients who do. Research also shows that as many as 90% of patients who participate in abstinence-based addiction treatment that bans the use of methadone or buprenorphine return to use within one year of being discharged. Treatment that relies on quitting opioids cold turkey, studies show, is significantly more dangerous than not receiving treatment at all.\r\nSystemically denying Americans access to addiction medications has also exacerbated racial health disparities. The first decades of the opioid crisis claimed far more white lives than Black lives. But as of 2022, the trend has flipped: Black people now die of opioid overdoses at higher rates in part because Black people seeking treatment for opioid use disorder are far less likely than white people to be prescribed an addiction medication.\r\nThe cost of these outdated and scientifically inaccurate attitudes is immense. The opioid crisis has shortened the national life expectancy by more than half a year, weakened U.S. economic output by $1.5 trillion in 2020 alone, and ruined the lives of countless others who are addicted to heroin or fentanyl but havent died of an overdose.\r\nBut these medications are not a silver bullet: Even if methadone and buprenorphine were universally accessible, the opioid crisis wouldnt instantly end. Studies show that most Americans with opioid use disorder are not actively seeking treatment.\r\nThe system creates barriers to care\r\nParadoxically, it is often those who claim to be most sympathetic to the cause of addiction treatment who are among the biggest opponents of expanded access to methadone and buprenorphine.\r\nThe recovery group Narcotics Anonymous perhaps the countrys largest provider of addiction treatment has taken a hard line against addiction medication. The organizations own literature acknowledges that people taking methadone or buprenorphine are often banned from speaking at meetings, but offers a concession: NA may be compatible for addicts on medically assisted protocols if they have a desire to become clean one day.\r\nIn other words: In the view of Narcotics Anonymous, even people who have relied on methadone or buprenorphine to achieve stable recovery are not considered clean. Instead, their full participation in the program would require a pledge to stop taking medications they were prescribed by a doctor, and that first helped them quit illicit drugs.\r\nNarcotics Anonymous did not respond to STATs requests for comment.\r\nMethadone clinics have also opposed calls to expanded access to medication treatment. The American Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence, a trade group representing methadone clinics, has lobbied not just against the deregulation of methadone treatment, but also against a bill that passed in 2022 with overwhelming bipartisan support that made it easier for doctors to prescribe buprenorphine. And in recent decades, methadone treatment has become big business: A majority of methadone clinics now operate as for-profits, and nearly one-third are owned by private equity firms. As calls for reform have grown far louder in recent years, the methadone industry has guarded its monopoly fiercely, and remains staunchly opposed to allowing other doctors to prescribe the medication to patients in need.\r\nSeparately, according to federal survey data, at least 751 substance use treatment facilities offer treatment for opioid addiction but reject clients using methadone and buprenorphine. More than 2,000 addiction treatment facilities did not respond to the federal survey, meaning the true number of facilities banning medication is probably significantly higher.\r\nMany medical schools still dont require any training in addiction medicine, or prescribing addiction medications. Many hospitals still do not offer patients buprenorphine or methadone, even in the immediate aftermath of an overdose. Many pharmacies choose not to stock buprenorphine. And insurers, in an effort to pad profit margins, sometimes refuse to pay for newly developed injectable buprenorphine formulations, which last weeks or months and are shown to help patients remain in treatment but cost far more than cheaper versions that must be taken daily.\r\nThe American criminal justice system also remains skeptical of medication as treatment. The Drug Enforcement Administration has long displayed hostility to buprenorphine and methadone, and many jails and prisons refuse altogether to provide incarcerated people with either medication. Many judges with no medical training even in drug court systems supposedly meant to aid addiction recovery have historically barred people arrested for low-grade drug offenses from taking any opioid, including addiction medications.\r\nAs workers, people taking addiction medications face immense discrimination. Many employers, labor unions, and professional societies ban their members from taking addiction medications in any circumstance.\r\nThere are a lot of ways that the system creates barriers to care, said Weinstein, the Boston addiction doctor. We start to believe that if the system is created that way, it must be necessary, there must be a good reason. But that may not be true: The reason may be outdated, or never existed, or was based on stigma.\r\nA paramedic in Portland, Ore., loads a patient into an ambulance after they were administered naloxone, a medication used to reverse opioid overdoses.PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images\r\nIt doesnt get you high\r\nThe addiction crisis is among the largest public health emergencies in U.S. history. But the American people and government have treated it with a remarkable lack of urgency.\r\nRecent events provide a stark comparison. In early 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic led the U.S. to launch an unprecedented effort to develop a vaccine. The government told drug companies, in essence, that it would pay them whatever they wanted. Most doctors made clear that they would provide any eventual vaccines to anybody who wanted them.\r\nThe U.S. opioid crisis is precisely the opposite. More than 1 million Americans have died of drug overdoses since 2000, and opioid death rates have steadily increased for the past two decades. But\xa0there is no Operation Warp Speed for addiction. There has been no rush to develop miraculous new drugs that can sharply reduce deaths from a devastating health crisis in part because the government and pharmaceutical industry have displayed minimal interest in the crisis, and in part because these medications already exist.\r\nThe publics broad opposition to addiction medications stands in stark contrast to its general acceptance of other common strategies used to improve health. Broadly speaking, Americans do not oppose drinking Diet Coke instead of Coke, cooking with olive oil instead of butter, or chewing nicotine gum instead of smoking cigarettes. But when it comes to using relatively weak, highly regulated, pharmaceutical-grade opioids to help quit deadly synthetic drugs like fentanyl, much of society remains staunchly opposed.\r\nThe entertainment industry, in particular, has often served as a cheerleader for misleading tropes and treatment approaches that oppose medication. The recent hit show Euphoria, for instance, depicts a teen who develops an opioid addiction but is only offered treatment based on the 12-step model offered by Narcotics Anonymous not with medication. A decade ago, House, an award-winning medical drama about the star doctor at an elite teaching hospital, gave its protagonist two choices: use copious amounts of Vicodin or grit out a week of brutal and dangerous withdrawal. Four Good Days, a Mila Kunis movie released in 2020, is based on a nearly identical premise.\r\nThe few mainstream voices who have sought to increase acceptance for medications have failed often in tragic fashion. Kurt Cobain, among the most influential musicians of his generation, wrote in a 1993 journal entry that he had found success treating his opioid withdrawal symptoms thanks to buprenorphine.\r\nThe best thing about it is that there are no known side effects, he wrote. It acts as an opiate but it doesnt get you high.\r\nThe doctor who prescribed buprenorphine to Cobain died in 1993, however, cutting him off from a medication that, at the time, was only legally available as a pain treatment. Unable to find another doctor willing to provide it, he returned to heroin use. He died by suicide in 1994.\r\nWe need everybody to step up\r\nAttitudes toward medication for opioid use disorder are finally beginning to shift. The 2022 repeal of the X-waiver requirement for doctors came after years of lobbying from public health groups seeking wider access to buprenorphine.\r\nIncreasingly, researchers and members of Congress have called for ending methadone clinics monopoly and allowing physicians to prescribe the medication directly to patients. In 2021, the Urban Survivors Union, an activist group focused on harm reduction and the safety of people who use drugs, published the Methadone Manifesto, a sweeping call for change highlighting the human costs of the current methadone-distribution system.\r\nAnd for the first time, the White House has pledged to make medication access a priority: President Biden said in the 2022 State of the Union address that his administration plans to make addiction medications universally accessible by 2025.\r\nBut there is no chance the country will meet his goal.\r\nTo do so, far more doctors would need to prescribe buprenorphine. Hospitals, pharmacies, and insurers would need to radically shift their policy and practice to encourage the use of addiction medications and provide a less hostile treatment environment for people with addiction. Congress and local lawmakers would need to pass laws mandating access to medication treatment. Branches of government including prisons, courts, and law enforcement would need to overhaul their own rules regarding access to treatment for the hundreds of thousands of people with addiction charged with, or serving time for, drug-related crimes.\r\nKey components of the countrys existing addiction treatment infrastructure, from Narcotics Anonymous to rehab facilities, would need to adopt a different tone regarding the benefits of methadone or buprenorphine. Many methadone clinics, as well, would need to take a more welcoming, less punitive tack toward patients who come to seek treatment.\r\nAbsent those changes, American societys deeply embedded bias against addiction medications make it all but certain that the status quo will remain or at least, that the U.S. wont change course before losing hundreds of thousands more of its citizens.\r\nOutdated views, combined with stigma around treatments for opioid use disorder, combined with the challenging regulatory environment, are leading to a situation where people just arent getting evidence-based care, said Jesse Ehrenfeld, an anesthesiologist and president of the American Medical Association. This is a moment where we need everybody to step up, and stop dragging their feet.\r\nSTATs coverage of chronic health issues is supported by a grant from\xa0Bloomberg Philanthropies.

"{'Experts generally point to an increasingly toxic drug supply to explain the rise, with powerful opioids like fentanyl and carfentanil all but replacing heroin and also finding their way into other drugs like cocaine, meth, and counterfeit pills. After several encouraging years of decline, Rhode Island experienced sharp increases in 2020 (384 deaths, then the highest on record) and 2021 (435 deaths, now the highest on record.) So far, state health officials have accounted for 331 overdose-related deaths in 2022, with data still incomplete from July on.\r\nFew states have escaped the trend.\r\nBut Rhode Island will stand apart in 2023 in trying something new, at least by US standards: supervised drug use sites.\r\nA little over a month ago, two organizations the street outreach organization Project Weber/RENEW and CODAC Behavioral Healthcare submitted a joint proposal to the state Executive Office of Health and Human Services for funding to open one on Huntington Avenue in Providence, a building CODAC already owns and operates. The initial $2 million in funding would come through settlement money from opioid makers. Though the funding proposal hasnt been approved, it appears to be the only one that was submitted.\r\nNew York City opened the first sanctioned sites in 2021; attempts in Philadelphia to open them have been tied up in the courts. Canada and Europe have had them for years. For a US state, though, Rhode Island is trying something unprecedented. Green, whos also an adjunct associate professor of epidemiology and emergency medicine at Brown University, doesnt think itll be alone for long.\r\nI think there are more states as well very interested in following the Rhode Island lead, Green said.\r\nThe supervised drug use center the concept also goes by names like safe injection sites, overdose prevention centers, and harm reduction centers became possible in Rhode Island thanks to legislation that passed in 2021. The pilot program comes with a number of regulations.\r\nIf awarded, the organizations would transform the ground floor of CODACs Huntington Avenue building into a supervised drug use center. People would be able to bring their own drugs to use there. Staff on site could offer everything from clean needles to wound care to coats to case management. And given the increasing lethality of the supply, people will be able to test their drugs first for adulterants.\r\nIf someone overdosed, a peer outreach staffer from Project Weber/RENEW would use Narcan to revive them. Medical staff, including a nurse and doctor, would be on site.\r\nUpstairs, CODAC would continue offering medication-assisted addiction treatment to people who want to seek it out. But the idea isnt to force recovery on people; instead its to have it available for when theyre ready.\r\nCODAC said some work will be necessary to prepare the site, but it could be open and operating by June if everything gets approved. The proposal still would need a license from the Department of Health and approval from Providence.\r\nIts grounded in the theory of harm reduction keeping people alive and healthy for long enough to get into recovery if and when theyre ready. Sometimes that means clean needles so people wont get hepatitis C or HIV from using dirty ones; in this case it means giving them a place to use drugs while a trained staffer looks on with an overdose reversal kit, with nurses and doctors waiting in the wings.\r\nWe understand that dead people dont enter recovery, said Annajane Yolken, the overdose prevention center liaison for Project Weber/RENEW. Our No. 1 priority is to save lives. Weve lost too many people. If people arent alive, all these great things we talk about with recovery arent possible.\r\nThe idea of harm reduction in general, and safe drug consumption sites in particular, is not without controversy.\r\nState Rep, Mike Chippendale, a Republican of Foster who is now the minority leader, opposed the legislation for supervised drug use sites in the General Assembly. More needs to be done to reduce the prevalence of drug use before opening up these sorts of sites, Chippendale said.\r\nWe havent done all the work that leads up to it, Chippendale said.\r\nChippendale said he agrees that the opioid epidemic needs to be treated primarily as a health issue. But were not in a position to expect success from safe injection sites, he said.\r\nIn Canada, a report solicited by the government of Alberta raised concerns about the effect on the surrounding neighborhood, about recordkeeping and oversight, and about the lack of referrals to detoxification and treatment services. (Supporters of the sites reject those claims, pointing to studies on their effectiveness at both keeping people alive and increasing engagement in treatment. The fact that the proposed Rhode Island site will be in a place long used for addiction treatment would seem to alleviate nuisance concerns, some supporters say.) California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed legislation that would have created safe drug injection sites in some cities.\r\nLinda Hurley is often at the center of these sorts of discussions. The president and CEO of CODAC, Hurley has a ready response to skeptics: You cant make another adult do anything. If consequence worked, nobody would die of an overdose or end up back in jail. Overdose prevention centers, she said, will keep people safe until theyre ready to make their own choices.\r\nI really dont have any doubt in my mind that its going to work, Hurley said.\r\nWhat does work mean?\r\nIt means its going to save lives, Hurley said.\r\nAt this point, the legislation is still just a pilot, and it expires March 2024. Discussions are underway to extend that sunset, Project Weber/RENEW said. The funding is also temporary. CODAC and Project Weber/RENEW would have to find ongoing support for the program.\r\nGiven the severity of the crisis, its one of several steps state health leaders said are necessary to stem the tide, which also includes meeting people where they are church communities, nursing homes and pushing more Narcan into the community.\r\nBut its a significant one, and it tends to draw attention.\r\nWhenever I look at the overdose prevention centers, I look at the opportunity to have that person be exposed to services, or, as I say, theyre going to get exposed to hope, said Thomas Joyce, the community co-chair of the governors overdose task force. In the recovery community, we sell hope its what we do on a daily basis.\r\nOn a drizzly recent December weekday, the scale of the need could be seen at Project Weber/RENEWs Pawtucket drop-in center, which seemed extremely busy to an outsider, but actually wasnt.\r\nThis is actually slow, Chirrell Robinson, a peer recovery advocate, said with a sort of shrug while staffers hustled about and clients waited in the crowded front vestibule.\r\nPeople go to Project Weber/RENEW for everything from clean needles to coats to Narcan, which can reverse overdoses. But they have to come first. In recent weeks, multiple people in the surrounding area had died of drug overdoses in quick succession. A supervised drug use center, Robinson believes, would help.\r\nAt least this way, we wont be finding people dead in tents and cars, Robinson said.\r\nFor all the questions these sorts of sites raise, supporters point to one key statistic from the experience in Europe and Canada.\r\nIn the history of overdose prevention centers, no one has ever died of an overdose, said Lex Morales, sitting behind his desk at the Pawtucket drop-in center, where he is the director. Like a lot of people at Project Weber/RENEW, he is in long-term recovery from substance use disorder. So its going to save lives.\r\nIt will also help the community more broadly, said a man named Charles, who went from being a client to being a worker at the organization.\r\nWhen I was out there using, I would go into public bathrooms, restaurants, grocery stores, the Kennedy Plaza bathroom, said Charles, who asked to use only his first name for this story. So its going to help the community out. I wasnt thinking about who was seeing what, or if I was leaving a needle lying around. So I think its a great idea.\r\nThe center wont just be a place for people to use drugs, supporters said. It will also offer people the opportunity to get help navigating the Medicaid system, or with food and housing insecurity. And if theyre ready, theyll have treatment available, although it wont be high-pressure, in-your-face type think of a poster on the wall rather than someone stuffing a flier in everyones hand.\r\nThe key word is ready, and its different for every person.\r\nFor Charles, that moment came in Boston, when he woke up one morning a few years ago in a park alongside the Charles River in Boston and decided that he was either going to give up the life he was living he did about every substance except crack and had overdosed twice or kill himself. He chose the former. Now he goes to the Charles River to kayak.\r\nFor a man named Angel, a Project Weber/RENEW client, that day hadnt come. Nobody was pressuring him to get there or judging him for not doing so.\r\nI think recovery is beautiful, if you want to live that life to each his own, Angel said.\r\nIn the meantime, he stops in at Project Weber/RENEW. And hed consider using the supervised drug use site theyre planning to open.\r\nOf course, he said. You dont have to worry about the cops busting you, you dont have to worry about sneaking around, youre not leaving stuff around. It would be way better.\r\nBrian Amaral can be reached at brian.amaral@globe.com.

"{'Buprenorphine, otherwise known by its brand name, Suboxone, is an essential medication in the treatment of opioid addiction. Access to this therapy remains limited by a unique requirement that prescribing physicians must obtain a special waiver from the US Drug Enforcement Agency after eight hours of certified education. The original legislation, cosponsored by then-Senator Joe Biden in 2000, was focused on increasing access to opioid addiction treatment. The historical basis for this additional training rested in concerns about effectiveness, availability, and adverse health consequences of patients during the transition of opioid use disorder treatment from a methadone clinic to a doctors office. Now, after two decades of successful office-based use in the United States, these dated and unnecessary restrictions on prescribing are obstructing access to lifesaving essential care for opioid dependence.\r\nAs specialists caring for patients with addictive disorders at the University of Massachusetts School of Medicine, we have seenfirst-hand the disastrous consequences of limiting buprenorphine prescribing capacity through the additional training requirement.For many of our colleagues, the federal regulations on prescribing this vital treatment, which include the cost and time commitment associated with the additional training, are too great a hurdle among competing priorities. UMass Medical School and other schools in the Commonwealth have done extensive work in providing core training to medical students in opioid prescribing and in buprenorphine therapy for addiction. Sadly, we still lack sufficient numbers of prescribers able to offer equitable and easy access to buprenorphine in Massachusetts and the rest of the country.\r\nOpioid use disorder is a complex disease requiring a multidisciplinary approach to treatment involving medications, counseling, and other psychosocial supports. The medications themselves, however, are not abnormally complex for someone who has completed medical school. Buprenorphines long duration of action and partial agonist effect offer unique and significant safety advantages over other opioid medications, treating opioid withdrawal and cravings while decreasing the overall likelihood of overdose. Yet prescribers are not required to undergo additional training prior to writing their first prescription for opioid painkillers like Percocet, Vicodin, or OxyContin.\r\nThe opioid crisis has never been more pressing. Preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicate that there were more than 81,000 overdose deaths in the United States between June 2019 and May 2020, the highest number of overdose deaths recorded in a 12-month period in US history. Initial data reports suggest synthetic opioids (like fentanyl) are responsible for this increase. The coronavirus pandemic has created additional stressors for individuals with opioid use disorders, leading to financial stressors, interruptions in treatment, and loss of social connectedness.\r\nIn 2020, more than 2,000 people in Massachusetts died from an opioid-related overdose. The role of buprenorphine in preventing deaths is clear. Among people in Massachusetts who were seen in an emergency department after an opioid overdose, buprenorphine treatment decreased their risk of death from overdose and their all-cause mortality by almost 40 percent.\r\nIn the closing days of the Trump administration, the US Department of Health and Human Services moved to remove the special waiver requirement for physicians to prescribe buprenorphine. The Biden administration then determined that it could not eliminate the regulation through executive action alone and halted the effort. Legislative action would be the way to permanently address this issue.\r\nThe Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment Act of 2019, introduced in the House by Representative Paul Tonko of New York and in the Senate by Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, would have eliminated the requirement for additional training in order to be able to prescribe buprenorphine. Even though this bill was endorsed by Attorney General Maura Healy, there were no Massachusetts congressional cosponsors.\r\nWe acknowledge that while the removal of the eight hours of extra training requirement for buprenorphine prescribing is necessary to mainstream the care of patients impacted by opioid use disorder, this change alone will not ensure sufficient availability of treatment. More work will be required to reduce the stigma associated with the care of these patients and to incentivize physicians to provide evidence-based care to those they serve.\r\nIn the meantime, we ask that our legislators continue to be leaders on the forefront of addiction treatment and preventing overdose deaths by supporting legislation that leads to the removal of the waiver requirement for buprenorphine prescribing. Doing away with the waiver wont just save lives; it will save lives immediately.\r\nThe authors are professors at the University of Massachusetts School of Medicine, where Dr. Amy L.

"{'The deals, if completed, would end thousands of lawsuits in which governments claimed pharmacies filled prescriptions they should have flagged as inappropriate. With settlements already proposed or finalized between some of the biggest drugmakers and distribution companies, the recent developments could be the among the last multibillion-dollar settlements to be announced.\r\nThey also would bring the total value of all settlements to more than $50 billion, with most of it required to be used by state and local governments to combat opioids, which have been linked to more than 500,000 deaths in the US over the last two decades.\r\nIts one more culprit of the overdose crisis that is having to pay their dues, said Courtney Gary-Allen, organizing director of the Maine Recovery Advocacy Project. Average Americans have been paying it for a long time.\r\nGary-Allen, who is a member of a council that will help determine how Maine uses its opioid settlement funds, said more money to address the problem will help. In her state, she said, the needs include more beds for medical detox and for treatment.\r\nNeither Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based CVS nor Deerfield, Illinois-based Walgreens is admitting wrongdoing.\r\nThe plans spring from mediation involving a group of state attorneys general. Before they move ahead, state, and then local governments would need to sign on. So far, the detailed, formal deals have not been presented to the government entities so they can decide whether to join.\r\nUnder the tentative plans, CVS would pay $4.9 billion to local governments and about $130 million to Native American tribes over a decade. Walgreens would pay $4.8 billion to governments and $155 million to tribes over 15 years. The exact amount depends on how many governments join the deals.\r\nBoth noted they have been addressing the crisis through such measures as starting educational programs and installing safe disposal units for drugs in stores and police departments. And both said the settlements would allow them to help while staying focused on their business.\r\nWe are pleased to resolve these longstanding claims and putting them behind us is in the best interest of all parties, as well as our customers, colleagues, and shareholders, Thomas Moriarty, CVS chief policy officer and general counsel, said in a statement.\r\nWalgreens said in a statement: As one of the largest pharmacy chains in the nation, we remain committed to being a part of the solution, and this settlement framework will allow us to keep our focus on the health and wellbeing of our customers and patients, while making positive contributions to address the opioid crisis, Walgreens said in a statement.\r\nPaul Geller, a lawyer for governments in the lawsuits, said talks with Walmart continue. Walmart representatives would not comment Wednesday.\r\nThese agreements will be the first resolutions reached with pharmacy chains and will equip communities across the country with the much-needed tools to fight back against this epidemic and bring about tangible, positive change, lawyers for local governments said in a statement. In addition to payments totaling billions of dollars, these companies have committed to making significant improvements to their dispensing practices to help reduce addiction moving forward.\r\nIf these settlements are completed, they would leave mostly smaller drug industry players as defendants in lawsuits. Just this week, a group of mostly regional pharmacy chains sent to a judge, who is overseeing federal litigation, information about claims they face a possible precursor to scheduling trials or mediating settlements involving some of those firms.\r\nOne by one, we are holding every player in the addiction industry accountable for the millions of lives lost or devastated by the opioid epidemic, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement. The companies that helped to create and fuel this crisis must commit to changing their businesses practices, and to providing the resources needed for treatment, prevention and recovery.\r\nMost of the nations opioid overdose deaths initially involved prescription drugs. As governments, doctors, and companies took steps to make them harder to abuse and obtain, people addicted to them increasingly switched to heroin, which proved more deadly.\r\nIn recent years, opioid deaths have soared to record levels around 80,000 a year. Most of those deaths involve illicitly produced version of the powerful lab-made drug fentanyl, which is appearing throughout the US supply of illegal drugs.\r\nOnly a handful of opioid settlements have had bigger dollar figures than the CVS plan. Distributors AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson this year finalized a combined settlement worth $21 billion, and drugmaker Johnson &amp; Johnson finalized a $5 billion deal.\r\nPurdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, and members of the Sackler family who own the company have a proposed settlement that would involve up to $6 billion in cash, plus the value of the company, which would be turned into a new entity with its profits used to combat the epidemic. That plan has been put on hold by a court.': ""{{'PERSON': ['Courtney Gary-Allen', 'Thomas Moriarty', 'Paul Geller', 'William Tong'], 'DATE': ['the last two decades'], 'LOC': ['US', 'Maine', 'Woonsocket', 'Rhode Island', 'Deerfield', 'Illinois'], 'ORG': ['Maine Recovery Advocacy Project', 'CVS', 'Walgreens', 'Walmart', 'AmerisourceBergen', 'Cardinal Health', 'McKesson', 'Johnson & Johnson', 'Purdue Pharma'], 'PROGRAMS': ['the opioid settlement funds', 'educational programs', 'safe disposal units', 'settlements'], 'IMPACT': ['more money to address the problem', 'significant improvements to their dispensing practices', 'the resources needed for treatment, prevention and recovery', 'settlements would allow them to help while staying focused on their business']}}""}"
"{'Two years ago, Minnesotans who carried thin strips of paper for detecting whether street drugs contain fentanyl could be arrested and charged with possession of drug paraphernalia.\r\nNow, those paper strips no more than a few inches long have emerged as a vital tool in the state\'s fight to prevent opioid overdoses, which continue to claim hundreds of lives in Minnesota each year.\r\nNonprofit community groups and health clinics have given away more than 100,000 of the fentanyl test strips since Minnesota legalized them in July 2021.\r\nThe strips are already changing user behavior: The vast majority of people who discover fentanyl in their drugs using the strips have taken steps to reduce the risks of a deadly overdose, according to surveys by Minnesota providers.\r\nThe Steve Rummler Hope Network, the state\'s largest provider of free fentanyl test kits, has surveyed 722 people who have used the strips since October 2021. Of these, 90% said they changed their behavior to reduce overdose risk. Some 31% of respondents said they decided not to use the drug, while 23% chose to increase safety by using in a group or with another person. Others said they took smaller doses or slowed their drug intake, according to the participant survey.\r\nThose findings are consistent with a smaller survey by NorthPoint Health and Wellness Center in north Minneapolis, which found that 89% of test strip users took overdose-prevention measures once they discovered fentanyl.\r\n""Fentanyl test strips are gold,"" said Dr. Charles Reznikoff, an addiction medicine doctor with Hennepin Healthcare, who hands out the strips to many of his patients. ""It not only saves lives, it serves as a reminder to the person that fentanyl may be present in whatever drug they may be using and is deadly.""\r\nA surge in fatal overdoses has heightened the urgency of efforts to distribute the test strips.\r\nIn 2021, overdose fatalities reached 1,286 up 22% from the previous year and the highest in at least the past decade. Through an analysis of death certificates, the Minnesota Department of Health found that fentanyl a synthetic opioid up to 50 times stronger than heroin was involved in 90% of all deaths linked to opioid use that year. Because it is cheap, potent and plentiful, fentanyl is being mixed into a growing number of opioids to produce a stronger high.\r\nThe fentanyl test strips are part of a broader approach known as harm reduction, which seeks to give people tools to reduce their risk of dying or contracting infectious disease rather than emphasizing abstinence.\r\nThe paper strips work much like over-the-counter pregnancy tests. Each strip is dipped into a small amount of water containing a bit of drug residue. After a couple of minutes, either one or two red lines appear on the strip. One line means the liquid contains fentanyl; two lines means the test did not detect the drug. The strips can detect fentanyl in all types of drugs, including heroin, cocaine and counterfeit pain pills, and in different forms (pills, powder, and injectables).\r\n""One reason the fentanyl test strips are so useful is there is a full-tilt industry of producing fentanyl, and right now it\'s humming,"" Reznikoff said. ""There\'s a ton of [fentanyl], and that\'s why it keeps being put in all these different [drugs] and keeps killing people.""\r\nOn a blizzardy morning, Gabe Lyrek, a harm reduction specialist, demonstrated how the strips work from the NorthPoint\'s harm reduction and testing services center in north Minneapolis, which provides the strips and other tools free of charge.\r\nSlowly, Lyrek poured a tiny amount of sterile water from a test kit into an aluminum cup, sometimes called a ""cooker"" by drug users. Then he sprinkled in a sample of vitamin C powder no more than the diameter of a pencil into the cup and stirred it carefully. He then dipped the wavy end of the paper test strip into the mixture and waited 15 seconds before removing it. Within two minutes, the paper showed two pink lines a negative result confirming that fentanyl was not in the sample.\r\nLyrek and his team at NorthPoint have handed out more than 2,700 of the test strips since they were decriminalized the most of any on-site location in the state.\r\n""Once you know there\'s fentanyl in [the sample], then you can make an informed decision,"" Lyrek explained. ""You can use slower. You can use less. You can dilute your drugs more. But there are always other options once you find out that can prevent you from overdosing.""\r\nStaff at the NorthPoint harm reduction and testing services center are reminded daily of the high stakes of their efforts to educate users about the benefits of the test strips and other harm-reduction tools such as sterile syringes.\r\nAbout two months ago, a woman overdosed and was no longer breathing in a church parking lot adjacent to the center at 710 W. Broadway. When she was discovered by security guards, Lyrek and others rushed outside to help. It took mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and five doses of Narcan, a drug that reverses the effects of opioids, to revive the woman.\r\n""It\'s scary, because every time someone walks in here, that might be the last time you see that person,"" Lyrek said. ""That\'s why we really try to develop relationships with people and let them know we care.""\r\nThe need for fentanyl test kits has become so intense that it\'s now possible to buy them through Amazon.com and have them delivered to one\'s doorstep. While harm reduction specialists praise the growing availability of the strips, they encourage one-on-one visits to clinics and testing centers where they are available. Every time a fentanyl test kit is handed out, clinicians say, is another opportunity to talk to users about the deadly risks of fentanyl and ways to avoid overdosing.\r\n""Out of everything that we provide here, the most important thing of all is the fact that we care about you,"" Lyrek said. ""You don\'t know our name. We don\'t know your name. But the second you walk in that door, you have somebody who cares whether you live or die.""\r\nStaff writer Kim Hyatt contributed to this report.': ""{{'PERSON': ['Steve Rummler', 'Dr. Charles Reznikoff', 'Gabe Lyrek', 'Kim Hyatt'], 'DATE': ['Two years ago', 'July 2021', 'October 2021', '2021', 'About two months ago'], 'LOC': ['Minnesota', 'Minneapolis', 'north Minneapolis', '710 W.

"{'Masimo (NASDAQ: MASI) today announced that Masimo Opioid Halo™, an opioid overdose prevention and alert system, has been granted a De Novo by the FDA – making it the first and only FDA-cleared monitoring solution for detecting opioid-induced respiratory depression, the leading cause of death from opioid overdose. With the De Novo, Masimo also becomes the first winner of an FDA Opioid Innovation Challenge to have an authorized solution designed to help solve the U.S. opioid crisis. The De Novo authorizes Opioid Halo to be made available over the counter (OTC) without a prescription, for use on adults and children age 15 and up, and an Rx version for use by prescription from a healthcare provider. Opioid Halo advances the forefront of continuous monitoring through its unique Opioid Halo engine, an advanced pattern recognition algorithm which helps detect and quantify the risk of severe opioid-induced respiratory depression. Combined with its innovative distributed architecture, Opioid Halo helps to manage and send escalating alarms to family members, friends, and caregivers, notifying them that help may be needed due to an opioid overdose – including triggering an automatic wellness call, which may lead to EMS being dispatched.\r\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230403005131/en/\r\nMasimo Opioid Halo™ (Photo: Business Wire)\r\nJoe Kiani, Founder and CEO of Masimo, said, “We are very excited to be able to offer this solution to our fellow Americans and the community heroes who are helping to battle the opioid crisis – a crisis so devastating in its impact on the young that it has lowered overall life expectancy in the U.S. Now, with Opioid Halo, we hope to help make a big difference by providing a much needed tool that can help millions, whether they are taking prescribed opioids or struggling with illicit opioid use. In 2018, we were honored to be chosen by the FDA, based on our expertise in patient monitoring technologies, to develop a device that could help prevent opioid overdose, as part of their Innovation Challenge addressing the opioid epidemic. And today, we are delighted to have received the first De Novo for our response to that Innovation Challenge, Masimo Opioid Halo. Between then and now, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated our development and refinement of the Masimo SafetyNet® family of remote patient management and telehealth solutions, helping save many COVID patients’ lives. We thank the FDA for taking on the opioid epidemic and granting this De Novo – a clearance that is a huge step forward in preventing overdose deaths and helping to end the opioid crisis.”\r\nOpioid overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the US, responsible for more than 80,000 of the approximately 100,000 drug-related deaths in 2021, from both illicit opioids, such as fentanyl and heroin, and prescription opioids. Hundreds of thousands more suffer non-fatal overdose events, or the loss of a family member or friend to opioids.1 Opioids are readily prescribed in the US, with more than 143 million opioid prescriptions written in 2020,2 because they can be an effective way to help people manage pain, including after surgery or for chronic conditions. However, opioids also carry serious side effects, especially opioid-induced respiratory depression – slowed or stopped breathing –which is the leading cause of death from opioid overdoses.3 Anyone taking opioids, prescription or illicit, is at risk of experiencing an accidental overdose, the signs of which are unpredictable and can be difficult to detect.\r\nMasimo Opioid Halo is designed to help family and friends identify the symptoms of an opioid overdose by detecting physiological markers present during opioid-induced respiratory depression and ideally, helping them know when it’s time to intervene – for example, by administering a potentially life-saving dose of naloxone. Opioid Halo can be used at home or in the hospital or another care setting, by patients prescribed opioids after surgery or managing a chronic or prolonged condition, as well as people suffering from opioid use disorder.\r\nThe Opioid Halo system consists of four components: 1) a tetherless, adhesive fingertip sensor; 2) a reusable Masimo SET® pulse oximeter and Bluetooth® chip; 3) a Bluetooth-to-Wi-Fi Masimo Home Medical Hub; and 4) a smartphone app. The fingertip sensor provides real-time monitoring for opioid-induced respiratory depression, enabled by the Opioid Halo pattern recognition algorithm and Masimo SET®, Signal Extraction Technology® – even during movement, when hands are cold, and on all skin pigmentations. Data from the sensor and chip are wirelessly relayed to the Masimo Home Medical Hub and the smartphone app, which continuously analyzes the user’s physiological data for trends and patterns associated with the physiology of an opioid-induced respiratory depression event to quantify the risk of an opioid overdose. As the level of risk rises, the app and hub provide alerts. Upon early onset, an audible and visual alarm, designed to trigger early intervention opportunities for the user to self-recover or get help, is provided. If the Opioid Halo risk score continues to worsen, in addition to the repeated alarms, automatic texts are sent to designated friends and family members, letting them know it may be time to intervene, for example by administering naloxone or taking other action. Finally, if the severity of the risk level progresses even further, there is an optional setting that can be activated during setup that enables a service center to place an automatic wellness call to the user, the outcome of which may lead to EMS being dispatched.\r\nKim Bennion, MsHS, RRT, CHC, FAARC, System Director of Research for Respiratory Care Clinical Services at Intermountain Health, a 33-hospital system based in Salt Lake City, Utah, said, “Painkillers often called ‘opioids’ can have negative side effects, including opioid-induced respiratory depression. Intermountain Health has demonstrated that home monitoring of post-surgical patients receiving opioids for pain can help identify issues earlier and avoid adverse outcomes. As a registered respiratory therapist and leader in the field of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the post-surgical setting, we are excited that Masimo’s breakthrough device will be available for our patients.”\r\nRyan Hampton, a noted advocate, author, and person in recovery, said, “Joe Kiani and his team at Masimo are strong advocates for solutions to help end the overdose crisis. Opioid Halo is another breakthrough innovation that can help save lives by adding to the critical support tools for people who use drugs.”\r\n“My son Parker lost his life after taking prescription opioids to manage his pain after a tonsillectomy,” said Yvonne Gardner, now a patient safety advocate. “No one warned us that this could happen. This technology can help save other parents from losing a child.”\r\nMasimo CEO Kiani added, “For more than 30 years, Masimo has been empowering clinicians with life-saving technologies that improve outcomes for countless patients around the world. Opioid Halo furthers our mission to expand beyond the hospital and into the home, empowering everyday people with a solution that we believe has the power to improve and save many more lives.”\r\nFor more information about Masimo Opioid Halo, and to pre-order it today for a loved one, a community hero, or an organization, visit opioidhalo.com.\r\n@Masimo | #Masimo\r\nAbout Masimo\r\nMasimo (NASDAQ: MASI) is a global medical technology company that develops and produces a wide array of industry-leading monitoring technologies, including innovative measurements, sensors, patient monitors, and automation and connectivity solutions.

"{'Today is April 20th, otherwise known as 4/20 day or ""Weed Day,"" a day that has become associated with cannabis use across the world. But it also provides an opportunity to shed light on interesting recent research surrounding medical cannabis, some of which indicates that the judicious use of medical cannabis could help reduce the misuse of prescription opioids.\r\nUnderstanding prescription opioid misuse\r\nPrescription opioids are a class of painkillers often prescribed by physicians for people experiencing chronic pain. Such pain can derive from a variety of sources, including accidents, injuries, or military service, as well as from the wear and tear of everyday life.\r\nDespite their ability to dull and lessen pain, prescription opioids have many side effects; specifically, they can be addictive. This can lead to opioid misuse by unwary individuals who started taking opioids on a doctors advice in a sincere effort to control pain. One survey indicates that over 10 million Americans misuse prescription opioids. Such misuse can be very dangerous. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that opioids were implicated in around 450,000 deaths in the U.S. from 1999 to 2018, and around 35,000 Americans died from overdoses related to the misuse of prescription opioids in 2019 alone. Moreover, the misuse of prescription opioids can lead to severe impairments in areas such as employment, education, and relationships.\r\nImportantly, surveys indicate higher rates of prescription opioid misuse in men than women; men account for around 70 percent of opioid overdose deaths. Some research suggests that men are disproportionately driven to prescription opioid misuse to control pain incurred in dangerous workplaces such as manufacturing, transportation, the military, or law enforcement fields in which men comprise the vast majority of the workforce.\r\nSuch men may be prescribed opioids by physicians and become slowly addicted over time. This can lead them to seek greater dosages from their doctors or to try obtaining prescription opioids on the black market, contributing to more severe addiction and a downward spiral resulting in the aforementioned impairments and overdoses.\r\nCan medical cannabis help?\r\nA growing corpus of research indicates that certain strains of medical cannabis (particularly strains rich in cannabidiol) have powerful pain-killing properties and can be a beneficial agent in chronic pain management. Indeed, some emerging research suggests that medical cannabis can provide a much-needed alternative to prescription opioids and may even mitigate some aspects of the opioid crisis. \r\nFor example, one seminal research study showed that U.S. states with medical cannabis laws had significantly lower rates of opioid overdose deaths compared to U.S. states without such laws, implying that pain sufferers often choose medical cannabis over opioids when such a choice is available.\r\nThis is consistent with my own research on Canadian military veterans living with chronic pain. Many reported that they were originally prescribed opioids for pain relief but that the side effects became intolerable. Given that cannabis is legal in Canada, they decided to use medical cannabis instead, which brought many benefits. This is illustrated in the veterans own words in the short but poignant video below:\r\nThe way forward\r\nA solid body of research indicates that the misuse of prescription opioids remains a massive health and social issue in the U.S. Meanwhile, a related body of research shows that medical cannabis can be an effective pain killer and is a preferred agent for many people living with chronic pain.\r\nHowever, the medical establishment has been slow to integrate such knowledge into everyday practice, perhaps due to (i) lack of training in medical cannabis; (ii) enduring stigmas associated with cannabis use and cannabis users; and (iii) concerns about prescribing a substance of ambiguous legal status. All this implies a need for concerted efforts to destigmatize cannabis use and raise awareness about emerging medical research on the topic, with such efforts targeted at medical practitioners and other influential stakeholders (e.g., teachers and employers), as well as the general public.\r\nThis could help create a climate in which medical cannabis becomes an accepted and legitimate option for people suffering from chronic pain, providing an alternative to opioid prescriptions. This, in turn, may help mitigate some aspects of the opioid crisis.\r\nLets weed out the cannabis myths now.': ""{'PERSON': ['None'], 'DATE': ['April 20th'], 'LOC': ['U.S.', 'Canada'], 'ORG': ['Centers for Disease Control and Prevention'], 'PROGRAMS': ['None'], 'IMPACT': ['the judicious use of medical cannabis could help reduce the misuse of prescription opioids', 'opioids were implicated in around 450,000 deaths in the U.S. from 1999 to 2018', 'The misuse of prescription opioids can lead to severe impairments in areas such as employment, education, and relationships', 'medical cannabis can provide a much-needed alternative to prescription opioids and may even mitigate some aspects of the opioid crisis', 'states with medical cannabis laws had significantly lower rates of opioid overdose deaths', 'medical cannabis can be an effective pain killer and is a preferred agent for many people living with chronic pain', 'medical cannabis becomes an accepted and legitimate option for people suffering from chronic pain']}""}"
"{'LA JOLLA, Calif., March 09, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MediciNova, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company traded on the NASDAQ Global Market (NASDAQ:MNOV) and the JASDAQ Market of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (Code Number: 4875), today announced it has partnered with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to repurpose MN-166 (ibudilast) as a potential medical countermeasure (MCM) against chlorine gas-induced lung damage such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI). Under the Division of Research, Innovation, and Ventures (DRIVe) Repurposing Drugs in Response to Chemical Threats (ReDIRECT) program, BARDA will provide funding for proof-of-concept studies of MN-166 in preclinical models of chlorine gas-induced acute lung injury. MN-166 is the first compound to receive BARDAs development support through the DRIVe ReDIRECT program. Kazuko Matsuda, M.D., Ph.D., M.P.H., Chief Medical Officer of MediciNova, Inc., commented, On behalf of the entire MediciNova team, we are grateful for the opportunity to partner with BARDA in an effort to repurpose MN-166 as a rapidly administered treatment for patients exposed to chemical agents such as chlorine. MN-166 attenuated histological changes observed in an ARDS animal model, including pulmonary edema in lung tissue, and protected against pulmonary injury by reducing cellular apoptosis in lung tissue. Considering that pulmonary edema is a hallmark feature of exposure to chlorine, MN-166 has the potential to improve health outcomes and save lives. To date, more than 800 research participants have been treated with high-dose MN-166 in MediciNovas clinical trials. MN-166 has shown a benign safety and tolerability profile. This project has been funded in whole or in part with Federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services; Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, under Contract No. 75A50121C00022. About MN-166MN-166 is a small molecule compound that inhibits phosphodiesterase type-4 (PDE4) and inflammatory cytokines, including macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). It is in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), progressive MS (multiple sclerosis), and DCM (degenerative cervical myelopathy), and also for glioblastoma, CIPN (chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy), and substance use disorder. In addition, MN-166 is being evaluated in patients with COVID-19 that are at risk for developing ARDS. About ReDIRECT BARDA established the ReDIRECT project to repurpose commonly available therapeutics as MCMs against chemical threats (e.g., cyanide, opioids, nerve agents, chlorine, sulfur mustard, etc.). During a chemical emergency, minutes matter and a rapid response is necessary to save lives and reduce the incidence of adverse health effects. Drug repurposing is a strategy that is used to identify new uses for FDA approved or late-stage investigational therapeutics outside of their original clinical indication. The identification of existing and commonly available therapeutics for repurposing as MCMs holds the potential to expand current response capabilities to chemical threats and strengthen the United States preparedness posture. About MediciNova MediciNova, Inc. is a publicly-traded biopharmaceutical company founded upon developing novel, small-molecule therapeutics for the treatment of diseases with unmet medical needs with a primary commercial focus on the U.S. market. MediciNova\'s current strategy is to focus on MN-166 (ibudilast) for neurological disorders such as progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), substance dependence (e.g., alcohol use disorder, methamphetamine dependence, opioid dependence) and glioblastoma (GBM), as well as prevention of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19, and MN-001 (tipelukast) for fibrotic diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

"{'MEXICO CITY — High-level delegations from Mexico and the United States on Friday laid out the outlines of a new security framework between the nations that at least conceptually marked a departure from the mindset that steered their cooperation over the past decade.\r\nThe so-called U.S.-Mexico Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health and Safe Communities seeks to move beyond the 13-year-old Merida Initiative that focused on building Mexicos crime-fighting capabilities and rule of law projects.\r\nIts time for a comprehensive approach to our security cooperation, one that will see us as equal partners in defining our shared priorities, tackle the root drivers of these challenges like inequity, like corruption and focus not only on strengthening law enforcement, but also public health, the rule of law, inclusive economic opportunities, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday.\r\nMexico Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard put it more succinctly: Goodbye Merida, welcome Bicentennial agreement.\r\nThe first substantive difference is that the Merida Initiative was, from the point of view of Mexico, focused on the thesis that the cartel capos had to be captured and that was sufficient, Ebrard said. Now they see that wasnt enough, that attention must be paid to expanding opportunities for youth and treating addiction, he said. The success of this is going to be measured in fewer homicides in Mexico and less drug consumption.\r\nThat shift in emphasis is in line with President Andrés Manuel López Obradors hugs, not bullets refrain and his stated uninterest in pursuing the leaders of Mexicos cartels.\r\nThe two governments joint declaration devoted considerable space to treating drug addiction — especially opioids and its societal effects in the public health context, a significant departure from Meridas emphasis on the criminal justice system.\r\nThe U.S. pledged to devote more resources to identify and treat people affected by opioids and Mexico committed to working with the United Nations to launch a program to better manage shipping containers to limit the importation of chemical precursors for synthetic drugs like fentanyl.\r\nMexico seized an estimated 1.3 tons of the synthetic opioid last year. That same year, the U.S. recorded 93,000 drug overdose deaths.\r\nThe governments committed to targeting importers of chemical precursors for fentanyl and methamphetamine, their financial networks and secret labs.\r\nThey also said they would work together to reduce the trafficking of guns, a high priority for violence-wracked Mexico, and to provide more opportunities to youth to make it harder for criminal organizations to recruit them.\r\nWe need to deal with the violence, dismantle the transnational criminal organizations and focus on prevention with the goal of creating the conditions for a culture of peace, while we work hand-in-hand to address the fundamental causes of crime, the joint statement said.\r\nMexicos Public Safety Secretary, Rosa Icela Rodríguez Velázquez said, for many years, the issue of Mexicos security has been addressed from the point of view that its only measured by the use of force, now we are combatting the causes that originate that violence with social programs, intelligence and coordination, listening to men and women in their towns, their municipalities and communities.\r\nImmigration is expected to be a key topic of the dialogue. López Obrador has been saying for months that Mexico cannot continue to simply detain migrants and try to contain them in the southern part of the country, far from the U.S. border.\r\nHe has asked the U.S. government to invest in two of his signature social programs to relieve some of the economic pressure people feel to migrate. The Biden administration needs Mexicos continued cooperation to manage the flow of migrants to the U.S. border.\r\nThe U.S. also must find a way to re-instate the controversial Trump-era policy that made asylum seekers wait out their cases in Mexico. Under the so-called Migrant Protection Protocols, tens of thousands of asylum seekers waited in dangerous Mexican border cities for their cases to advance. Biden had made cancelling the policy one of his first orders of business upon taking office, but the Supreme Court ordered that it be implemented again. Ebrard said that issue was not discussed Friday.\r\nMexico has also been pressing for the U.S. government to do more to stop illegal guns from pouring in from the U.S. The guns fuel Mexicos organized crime violence, creating a public safety issue that López Obradors government has been unable to adequately address.\r\nBoth sides were also expected to discuss the role of U.S. agents in Mexico and intelligence sharing. The governments insist that their security agencies work closely on a daily basis. But following the United States arrest of former Mexican Defense Secretary Salvador Cienfuegos, then his release after Mexicos loud protests, tensions have persisted.\r\nCienfuegos was arrested after he was secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in New York in 2019. He was accused of conspiring with the H-2 cartel to smuggle thousands of kilos of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana while he was defense secretary from 2012 to 2018.\r\nWith Cienfuegos back, Mexico said it would perform its own investigation, but it was quickly closed. López Obrador attacked U.S. prosecutors case against the general and accused the Drug Enforcement Administration of fabricating the case.\r\nMexico restricted U.S. agents working in the country and lifted their diplomatic immunity.\r\nAt a breakfast with both delegations Friday, López Obrador said it would be very unfortunate if we didnt understand each other, if our cooperation, the friendship between our governments and our peoples wasnt strengthened.\r\nThe goal is to have a three-year plan ready by the end of January.\r\nAP writer Fabiola Sánchez contributed to this report.': ""{'PERSON': ['Antony Blinken', 'Marcelo Ebrard', 'Andrés Manuel López Obrador', 'Rosa Icela Rodríguez Velázquez', 'López Obrador', 'Salvador Cienfuegos', 'Fabiola Sánchez'], 'DATE': ['Friday', 'the past decade', '13-year-old', 'last year', '2019', 'from 2012 to 2018', 'the end of January'], 'LOC': ['MEXICO CITY', 'Mexico', 'the United States', 'Mexicos', 'U.S.'], 'ORG': ['U.S.-Mexico Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health and Safe Communities', 'Merida Initiative', 'United Nations', 'Mexicos Public Safety Secretary', 'Supreme Court', 'Mexican Defense Secretary', 'H-2 cartel', 'Drug Enforcement Administration'], 'PROGRAMS': ['Merida Initiative', 'U.S.-Mexico Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health and Safe Communities', 'Migrant Protection Protocols'], 'IMPACT': ['move beyond the 13-year-old Merida Initiative that focused on building Mexicos crime-fighting capabilities and rule of law projects', 'The success of this is going to be measured in fewer homicides in Mexico and less drug consumption', 'the governments committed to targeting importers of chemical precursors for fentanyl and methamphetamine, their financial networks and secret labs','work together to reduce the trafficking of guns, a high priority for violence-wracked Mexico', 'provide more opportunities to youth to make it harder for criminal organizations to recruit them']}""}"

"{'Farhia Budul knows the devastating effect of opioid addiction. As a Somali woman in long-term recovery, she\'s made it her mission to help others, especially in Minnesota\'s East African and Muslim communities, overcome it as well.\r\n""You can just see problems and people struggling with addiction in plain sight,"" she said.\r\nThe opioid epidemic, fueled by a surge in fentanyl use, has shattered thousands of families across Minnesota. It has hit hardest among the state\'s people of color, who die at disproportionately high rates when compared with white Minnesotans.\r\nAmerican Indians were 12 times more likely than whites to die of an opioid-involved overdose in the state in 2022, while Black Minnesotans were four times more likely to die, according to preliminary data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\r\n""[Opioid] overdose is an issue for the whole state of Minnesota,"" said Pearl Evans, a prevention program administrator for the state Department of Health. But, she said, ""the African American and the American Indian [communities] are the two racial groups that have the highest disparity. So those are our priorities to really reduce the burden on those two communities.""\r\nIn response, cities, counties and the state are pouring millions of dollars into culturally specific treatment programs, using money from national settlements in cases against opioid makers and distributors over their role in the crisis. The state Department of Human Services said it licenses 55 such programs.\r\nHennepin County allocated $8.8 million in opioid settlement money over two years to 41 culturally specific programs that fight opioid addiction and address systemic disparities. The focus is on African American, American Indian, East African communities and unsheltered homeless populations, county officials said.\r\nThe city of Minneapolis, which accounted for approximately a quarter of all opioid-related deaths in the state in 2022, has recently awarded nearly $374,000 to five community based organizations with the aim of increasing access to and options for treatment, recovery and prevention, particularly targeting underserved communities and youth.\r\n""It\'s a scary time right now,"" said Lolita Ulloa, Hennepin County\'s director of system design. ""But really the sense of what is going to change is really based on the community.""\r\nThe county and state also are pushing efforts to gather additional race and ethnicity data to better identify needs and improve community engagement with inclusive language and better access to Naloxone, a drug that reverses opioid overdoses.\r\nLori Wilson, CEO of Turning Point, a longtime provider of culturally specific substance use disorder treatment for African Americans on Minneapolis\' North Side, said opioid abuse ""has been devastating.""\r\nWilson said one of the barriers to treatment for people of color is ""cultural mistrust"" of health care professionals. That\'s where organizations like Turning Point, which has Black leadership and staff, can offer a sense of safety.\r\n""If I have an opioid problem,"" Wilson said, ""it\'s unlikely I\'m going to take it outside my community.""\r\nSharyl WhiteHawk is an enrolled member of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Ojibwe in Wisconsin, and an addiction counselor at Khunsi Onikan treatment program at the American Indian Family Center in St. Paul.\r\nShe and others who work in the field point to the long history of persecution American Indians killed and pushed off their land by European settlers, forced erasure of language and culture at boarding schools that has reverberated through generations.\r\n""What makes us much more vulnerable to overdose deaths is that we have so many layers of unresolved trauma and unresolved grief,"" she said. ""Because of the boarding school experience, the only coping skill that has been passed down is don\'t talk, don\'t tell and don\'t feel.""\r\nAs a result, American Indians involved in treatment programs say that a key to recovery is reintroducing the Native culture, including traditional ceremonies, and spirituality. For instance, a cedar healing ceremony uses traditional cedar medicine to wash away unresolved grief and trauma.\r\n""Our cultures are a way of life, and our teachings show us how to be good human beings and in harmony with our creator,"" said Kateri Coyhis, an enrolled member of the Stockbridge-Munsee Community Band of Mohican Indians in Wisconsin and executive director of White Bison, a Native American nonprofit based in Colorado Springs. The organization provides culturally based programs and resources primarily geared for recovery from alcohol and substance use throughout the United States and Canada.\r\n""I feel we\'re at war with fentanyl and opioids,"" said Stephen Montry, a licensed alcohol and drug counselor in the Twin Cities area and an enrolled member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation in South Dakota. Montry, a descendant of the White Earth Ojibwe Nation, lost a nephew to a fentanyl overdose in 2022.\r\n""We need to get at the root why we\'re stuck in these patterns,"" he said.\r\nFrom 2018 to 2022, 45 overdose deaths were recorded in Minnesota\'s Somali community, according to the Health Department. But state health officials caution even this number is an undercount.\r\nThe Minnesota Somali Community Center tries to track opioid overdose deaths with the help of Janazah Project MN, a Facebook page run by the funeral director of the Garden of Eden Islamic Cemetery in Burnsville. The community center said there were as many as 13 opioid related deaths in January 2024 alone.\r\n""We are dealing with a crisis that we have never seen before and it\'s devastated almost every family in our community,"" executive director Hassanen Mohamed said.\r\nIslam strictly prohibits the use of drugs, alcohol and other mind- and mood-altering substances, leading many Muslims to suffer in isolation and making the opioid crisis a ""silent killer"" in the East African Muslim community, Budul and other Somali professionals say.\r\nMany families avoid reporting deaths as an overdose, instead attributing them to other causes, such as heart attacks and dying in sleep, to keep them out of official records. Some decline autopsies and toxicology tests, which would reveal those deaths, citing religious exemptions.\r\nBudul is trying to address those challenges through her Niyyah Recovery Initiative. The nonprofit offers a blend of more culturally sensitive and faith-based approaches, including the first Islamic version of a 12-step program in Minnesota.\r\nThe program, Millati Islami meaning ""the path of peace"" was founded in Baltimore in 1980s to assist Muslims struggling with addiction find healing, support and guidance within the framework of Islam. The Minnesota chapter hosts Zoom discussions with its more than four dozen members at least three times a week.\r\n""We need that cultural component, which really involves our spirituality, and connecting us back to Allah,"" said Budul, who also often shares her own story of battling addictions and shame to instill hope in others.\r\nMeanwhile, at the Alliance Wellness Center in Bloomington, founder Yussuf Shafie grows frustrated as he reviews client files. He said he knows the available state-level data on opioid overdose in the Somali community doesn\'t match the sad reality.\r\n""I went to many funerals that I cannot even count,"" said Shafie, a social worker. ""How does a 22-year-old or 24-year-old die in their sleep? I mean, people die all the time, but the story doesn\'t add up. There\'s just a lot of shame and stigma.""\r\nThe center recently expanded its services by adding eight beds for Muslim and East African women with opioid use disorder.

OX124 is a nasal rescue medication for opioid overdose containing a high dose of naloxone and is the first product based on Orexo´s world-class\xa0drug delivery platform, amorphOX®. The PDUFA date is set to July 15, 2024, but recent review processes in the category indicate a risk of some delay.\r\nOX124 will meet the growing need for more powerful medications to improve the possibility of reviving individuals experiencing an overdose caused by use of synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, which today cause 91 percent of all fatal opioid overdoses.[2]\xa0OX124 is a potent medication and, in combination with rapid absorption and high bioavailability, this makes it capable of reversing an overdose or sustaining consciousness in a patient who has taken synthetic opioids. AmorphOX is an innovative powder-based technology that, in addition to rapid absorption and high bioavailability, improves stability and reduces sensitivity related to temperature changes. For users and lay-people[3]\xa0OX124 has the potential to become an efficient and reliable rescue medication independent of temperature variations during storage, for example its efficacy is not affected at freezing temperatures. OX124 is protected by patents until 2039.\r\nDriven by the need to increase access to overdose medication, low-dose products, including the market leader, have recently been approved by the FDA as non-prescription over-the-counter (OTC) products. Historically, OTC products in the US have had limited reimbursement from insurance companies and, when applying similar industry analogues going forward, this may provide an advantage to high-dose prescription naloxone products, such as OX124. In addition, high-dose prescription products are expected to benefit from the continued expansion of mandatory co-prescription of naloxone when prescribing opioids to at-risk patients suffering\xa0from pain.\r\nNikolaj Sørensen, President and CEO, said:\xa0""I am pleased the FDA can now start reviewing our rescue drug, OX124. With its high-dose of naloxone and unique formulation, OX124 has the potential to reduce the acceleration in fatal overdoses caused by the widespread misuse of synthetic opioids.

Applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the Application Guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in Section IV. When the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the Application Guide, follow the program-specific instructions.\r\nApplications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.\r\nPurpose\r\nThe goal of this initiative is to support research that can improve public health and respond to the opioid crisis by increasing knowledge pertaining to the implementation and sustainability of prevention services. This notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) solicits applications to address understudied areas of opportunity that, if researched, could create the foundation needed to inform a prevention infrastructure for ongoing delivery and sustainment of interventions to prevent opioid and other substance misuse and use disorders.\r\nThis NOFO is a companion to RFA-DA-24-066 which also solicits applications relevant to the focus area. Applicants should note the difference between these NOFOs, RFA-DA-24-066 solicits R61/R33 phased awards, which are most appropriate for projects that require 1-2 years for preparatory work such as collecting pilot data; obtaining and integrating existing data sets; building stakeholder engagement; developing, adapting, and testing the feasibility of key components of interventions or implementation strategies; building necessary infrastructure to support a larger trial; or similar activities upon which the subsequent phase would be dependent. Phased awards do not require pilot or feasibility data at the time of submission. In contrast, this NOFO RFA-DA-24-067 solicits R01 applications that already have relevant preliminary, pilot, or feasibility data.\r\nBackground\r\nThe NIH HEAL Initiative: This NOFO is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain management. More information about the HEAL Initiative is available at:\u202fhttps://heal.nih.gov/.\r\nThe importance of prevention in combating the opioid crisis is clear – identifying and implementing effective strategies to prevent the onset of opioid misuse and use disorder can yield positive individual, societal, and financial benefits and decrease the need for treatment services. In 2020, 9.5 million people aged 12 or older reported misusing opioids in the past year (National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2021), indicating that there are millions of people whose trajectories could have been changed, had they been exposed to an effective prevention strategy. Recent HEAL-funded research suggests that some risk factors for opioid misuse tend to be similar to risks for using other substances, and initiation of other substance use (e.g., cannabis) may precede initiation of opioid use in some populations. Previous and ongoing studies have developed and are testing innovative prevention approaches to address the range of individual, social, and environmental motivations for using non-prescription opioids, relevant to and effective for diverse populations.\xa0\r\nWhile there are effective prevention strategies, those strategies may not be widely implemented in practice. One of the biggest barriers to the wide-scale implementation of opioid and other substance use prevention interventions is the lack of infrastructure at the national and state levels to support prevention service delivery. Prevention programs are often embedded in broader systems or settings (e.g., schools, justice settings, social service settings, community behavioral health centers) and are, therefore, competing with other services for time and resources. In addition to limited resources, the scope and competencies needed for a prevention workforce are not well-defined. Finally, when prevention resources exist, those allocating the funding may not have information regarding evidence-based programs and practices, and may, therefore, not require their use. This may result in state agencies distributing the small amount of federal and state funds they receive for prevention to localities with varying guidance on how it can most effectively be used.\r\nDefinition of prevention: For this NOFO, the focus is selective or indicated prevention strategies.\xa0The scope of this NOFO\xa0is services related research to inform the delivery of strategies or programs that reduce risks for substance misuse, prevent initiation, or prevent escalation to substance use disorder (SUD) among individuals who are at-risk or already misusing substances (for additional information on the definition of intervention levels see:\xa0https://nap.nationalacademies.org/resource/25552/Prevention%20Models%20-%20FINAL.pdf)\r\nResearch Objectives\r\nTo ensure existing prevention intervention research efforts have a broad public health impact, research is needed to identify pathways for effective prevention strategies to be adopted and funded for wide-scale delivery. Thus, the goal of this initiative is to support research to address service delivery related questions.\xa0Projects submitted in response to this NOFO may define research to inform the establishment of a prevention infrastructure in one of two ways –\r\n<ol><li>Research on strategies to implement and sustain evidence-based prevention services, so they are embedded within existing systems and settings (e.g., healthcare, child welfare, justice, education), facilitating the ongoing delivery of prevention services by adapting programs to setting, using natural providers and leveraging existing resources within the system or setting; OR</li><li>Research to understand how to best develop and maintain an independent prevention workforce and delivery system that the settings/systems noted above can utilize to ‘refer’ individuals or families to for the receipt of preventive services when they may be experiencing risk for opioid or other substance use.</li></ol>Example areas of research interest include, but are not limited to:\xa0 \xa0\r\n<ul><li>Developing and testing approaches to the implementation, scale-up and sustainability of effective interventions to prevent opioid and other substance misuse and use disorder, including the testing of strategies to build infrastructure and capacity to deliver prevention services within diverse systems and settings.</li><li>Research to examine scientific solutions to prevention workforce capacity challenges, including developing and testing new approaches to training and retaining prevention workforce personnel (e.g., prevention practitioners, intervention implementers), task shifting and identifying opportunities to integrate prevention service delivery into a variety of staff positions, and strategies to build centralized, community-based prevention systems and workforces.\xa0</li><li>Developing and testing innovative strategies and models for optimizing key implementation processes: identifying intervention core components, adaptation and customization, implementation fidelity, and organizational or system level strategies to enhance uptake and sustainability of evidence based preventive interventions.</li><li>Research to leverage technology and/or ‘direct to consumer’ strategies to facilitate access to preventive care – this may include increased use of smartphone\xa0/mobile technology, use of social media for intervention delivery, or other methods as appropriate.</li><li>Research to test the cost benefits/offsets and cost-effectiveness of investment in prevention infrastructure and evidence-based interventions, including broad investment and benefits at the community or population level.</li><li>Studies examining the impact of evidence-based practice registries and other decision-making tools on uptake of evidence-based interventions and the longer-term impact on preventing substance use and promoting public health.</li><li>Strategies that seek to improve quality, availability, and utility of data that can be used to track the extent of program implementation and/or receipt of services within or between systems.\xa0</li></ul>Proposed research under this NOFO must move beyond descriptive studies that simply identify factors that facilitate or impede the delivery of effective preventive services. Rather, applications should seek to develop and test systematic strategies for the implementation and sustainability of effective strategies to prevent opioid and other substance misuse and/or use disorder, and strategies to reduce risk for overdose among individuals who do not meet criteria for SUD. To ensure sustainability of service delivery strategies tested, applicants should partner with communities and localities who use existing funds (e.g., federal block grant and demonstration grants; settlement funds; private foundations) to support evidence-based prevention programs and leverage those resources as the foundation for building infrastructure. Research should be designed in such a way that there is a high probability that interventions delivered can be scaled and sustained after the study period ends.\r\nMethodology used should accelerate the translation of findings generated by the proposed research into practice. To maximize the acceptability, feasibility, scalability and sustainability of prevention services being studied, applicants\u202fmust engage relevant end users\xa0in study conceptualization, design, execution, and interpretation. For the purpose of this NOFO, end user is broadly defined and may include policymakers, state and local level decision makers, practitioners, intervention implementers, families, youth, and community members. Applications proposing to embed an intervention within a specific setting should consider\xa0the potential generalizability of the proposed service delivery model (i.e., is the model specific to the intervention and setting being tested of is it a framework that could generalize to other prevention programs and settings). Attention should be paid to health disparities and inequities and their relevance to the interventions or services being studied.\r\nThis NOFO will not accept\xa0applications that seek to develop and test the efficacy of novel prevention intervention strategies. However, in most instances an intervention will be delivered in order to evaluate the services related research question. Data on an intervention’s effectiveness may be collected in the context of evaluating the services related research questions. Research that tests adaptations to the delivery platforms of existing interventions may also be submitted through this NOFO. This NOFO will not accept\xa0overdose prevention or harm reduction strategies for individuals with SUD, but applicants may propose prevention services or infrastructure research that includes consideration for community-level risks of overdose among those at risk for initiation of use or who have initiated substance use but do not meet criteria for SUD.\r\nPre-Application Consultation\r\nPotential applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with appropriate NIH Program staff early in the application development process. This early contact will provide an opportunity to discuss and clarify NIH policies and guidelines, including the scope of the project relative to the HEAL initiative mission and intent of this NOFO.\r\nSpecial Considerations:\r\nNational Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) applicants are strongly encouraged to review the guidelines and adhere to the requirements applicable to their research listed in the\xa0Special Considerations for NIDA Funding Opportunities and Awards. Upon award, these considerations will be included in the Notice of Grant Award.\r\nApplications Not Responsive to this NOFO:\r\nThe following applications will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed:\r\n<ul><li>Applications that do not address research questions related to implementation, scale-up, or sustainability of prevention services or the development of a prevention infrastructure</li><li>Applications testing novel preventive interventions; studies examining the efficacy of a prevention program</li><li>Applications that do not involve a prevention focus, where prevention is defined as any program or strategy whose purpose is to\xa0reduce risks for substance misuse, prevent initiation, or prevent escalation to SUD among individuals who are at-risk or already misusing substances (for additional information on the definition of intervention levels see:\xa0https://nap.nationalacademies.org/resource/25552/Prevention%20Models%20-%20FINAL.pdf)</li><li>Studies focused on implementation and sustainability of SUD treatment or treatment adherence related research will not be considered under this NOFO.</li><li>Applications that do not include preliminary data, pilot or feasibility data</li><li>Applications that do not include a plan for the meaningful engagement of end users as partners in the research process.</li></ul>There are also opportunities to harmonize data within the broader NIH HEAL Initiative. Applicants selected for funding should expect to have a conversation with NIH program staff early in their project regarding high priority areas for potential harmonization.\r\nDiversity: In addition to scientific diversity, applicants should strive to incorporate diversity in their team development plan. Research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. There are many benefits that flow from a diverse NIH-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust.\xa0In spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. NIH encourages institutions to diversify their student and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences. Please refer to Notice of NIH\'s Interest in Diversity\xa0NOT-OD-20-031\xa0for more details.\xa0\r\nEngaging People with Lived Experience and Other Collaborators: People with lived experience (e.g., patients, patient advocates, caregivers, families, community leaders) have important insights that can improve meaningful outcomes, uptake of research findings, and health equity across the continuum of research from basic through implementation studies. The perspectives of other relevant collaborators (e.g., health service providers, payors, public health agencies, community-based organizations, biotech, pharma) can further improve research impact. The NIH HEAL initiative strongly encourages applicants to specify their plan for meaningful engagement of people with lived experience and other collaborators in the research process. Meaningful engagement will vary with the focus of the research but should at minimum ensure that researchers are connecting with relevant collaborators and incorporating their perspectives throughout the conception, implementation, and dissemination of the research.\xa0Meaningful engagement should address what the researchers will learn and how the people with lived experience and/or collaborators will benefit from the partnership. To promote health equity, as is relevant for the research proposed, it is recommended that at least two people with lived experience from populations who experience health disparities should be meaningfully engaged in these efforts.\xa0See this resource for more information in engaging people with lived experience:\xa0https://aspe.hhs.gov/lived-experience).\xa0\r\nPI Meeting Attendance\r\nThe NIH HEAL Initiative will require a high level of coordination and sharing between investigators. It is expected that NIH HEAL Initiative recipients will cooperate and coordinate their activities after awards are made by participating in Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) meetings, including an annual HEAL Investigators Meeting, as well as other activities.\r\nClinical Trial Accrual\xa0\r\nThis NOFO will support applications that include a series of milestones for completion of the clinical trial (if proposed) and provide contingency plans to proactively confront potential delays or disturbances in attaining the milestones. Continuation of the award is conditional upon satisfactory progress, availability of funds, and scientific priorities of the HEAL Initiative. If, at any time, recruitment falls significantly below the projected milestones for recruitment, NIH will consider ending support and negotiating an orderly phase-out of the award. NIH retains the option of periodic external peer review of progress. NIH program staff will closely monitor progress at all stages for milestones, accrual, and safety.\xa0\r\nSee Section VIII. Other Information for award authorities and regulations.\r\nInvestigators proposing NIH-defined clinical trials may refer to the Research Methods Resources website for information about developing statistical methods and study designs.\r\nGrant: A support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.\r\nApplication Types Allowed \r\nNew\r\nResubmission\r\nRevision\r\nThe\xa0OER Glossary\xa0and the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide provide details on these application types. Only those application types listed here are allowed for this NOFO.\r\nOptional: Accepting applications that either propose or do not propose clinical trial(s).\r\nFunds Available and Anticipated Number of Awards \r\nThe NIH HEAL Initiative intends to commit an estimated total of $4,650,000 for this NOFO and the companion NOFO, RFA-DA-24-066, pending availability of funds and receipt of a sufficient number of meritorious applications\r\nApplication budgets are not limited but need to reflect the actual needs of the proposed project. It is strongly recommended that applicants not request a budget of more than $800,000 in direct costs per year.\xa0\r\nThe maximum project period is 5 years.\xa0\r\nNIH grants policies as described in the NIH Grants Policy Statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made from this NOFO.\r\n1.

"{'For the first time in U.S. history, more than 100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in a single year, health officials say. (Nov. 17)\r\nAP Domestic\r\nNew guidance on prescribing opioids unveiled today by the\xa0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\xa0avoids the strict limits found in a 2016 version that accelerated a\xa0nationwide drop in pain pill prescriptions but led to backlash from chronic pain patients.\xa0\r\nThe 229-page document advises doctors to limit new opioid prescriptions and discuss alternative therapies with patients.\xa0But the new guidance largely avoids figures on dosage and length of prescription and warns against abruptly or rapidly discontinuing pain pills for some chronic pain patients.\r\n""We\'ve built in flexibility so that there\'s not a one-size-fits-all approach,"" said Christopher Jones, acting director of the CDC\'s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.\xa0\r\nThe document includes a dozen recommendations on how and when to manage pain patients, including non-pain pill therapies, for people in non-hospital settings. Just as important, it does not include the ""hard thresholds"" from the 2016 version that ""were essentially taken out of context beyond (their)\xa0intent and applied as rigid laws, regulations and policies,"" Jones said.\xa0\r\nThe new guidance, available for the public to review and comment on over the next 60 days,\xa0is for doctors and non-physician prescribers who treat three categories of patients:\xa0adults\xa0with acute pain lasting\xa0less than one month;\xa0""subacute"" pain for one to three months; and chronic pain for three months or longer.\xa0It does not apply to sickle cell disease, cancer,\xa0palliative or end-of-life care.\xa0\r\nFor patients who have not taken opioids before,\xa0doctors should prescribe the lowest dosage. For chronic-pain\xa0patients, prescribers should be cautious about recommending opioids and gauge the risks and benefits.\xa0\r\nDoctors and other clinicians should recommend pain pills for chronic pain\xa0patients only if expected benefits and\xa0ability to do everyday tasks outweigh known risks, which can include addiction, overdose, heart trouble, broken bones or falls.\r\nDoctors also should discuss risks and benefits and\xa0should consider how opioid prescriptions\xa0will be discontinued.\r\nFor patients already on higher dosages, clinicians should\xa0rely on other therapies and try to gradually lower dosages or\xa0discontinue opioids. However, unless there\'s a life-threatening\xa0issue such as signs of overdose, doctors should not abruptly discontinue or rapidly reduce\xa0opioid dosages, the guideline said.\r\n""They are trying to thread a needle here,"" said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a\xa0Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health vice dean for public health practice and community engagement. ""They\'re trying to balance, on the one hand,\xa0the importance of clear guidance to clinicians. And on the other, the danger it could turn into\r\na rigid policy that undermines patient care.""\r\nAfter the 2016 guideline was released, more than half of states passed laws that limited initial opioid prescriptions for acute pain to seven days or less.\xa0Many states limited pain pill fills for Medicaid enrollees, and private insurers and pharmacies also curtailed opioid prescriptions. Some states enacted strict limits on doses, prompting doctors to aggressively taper patients who had been on opioids for years, and medical boards sanctioned doctors who ran afoul of the tighter requirements.\xa0\r\nUnder the old recommendation, chronic pain sufferers complained of suddenly being cut off from pills they had taken for months or even years. Some in the middle of cancer treatments or recovering from operations could not get pain medications.\r\nFollowing the earlier guideline, a non-peer reviewed survey of more than 3000 patients\xa0found 84% reported more pain and worse quality of life and 42% said they had considered suicide.\r\nAmid backlash from chronic pain patients and their allies, federal officials said doctors were misusing the\xa02016\xa0opioid pain medication guidelines. In a 2019 paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine,\xa0the CDC said many physicians were guilty of a ""misapplication""\xa0of the 2016\xa0guideline\xa0that clamped down on the use of opioids.\r\nMore: Pain patients left in anguish by doctors \'terrified\' of opioid addiction, despite CDC change\r\nIn a nod to the earlier controversy, the new report said prescribers should avoid misapplying the new guidance\xa0and not implement policies that result in unintended consequences for patients.\r\nThe guideline warned against being inflexible on the dose and duration, doctors no longer seeing\xa0chronic pain patients or cutting back on dosages for stable patients without discussing it with them.\r\nThe report also noted disparities in care based on race and geography, with Black opioid users less likely than whites to be referred to pain specialists.\xa0And rural residents are significantly more likely to be prescribed opioids when non-opioid treatments might be preferred, the report said.\xa0\r\n\xa0""We see continued long-standing disparities in access to pain care or the types of care that might be provided, in particular among racial ethnic minority populations who often are not provided pain care at the same level,"" the CDC\'s Jones said.\xa0\r\nOpioid prescriptions began declining in 2012 and the drop accelerated after the 2016 guidance was adopted. Still, the number of overdose deaths have continued to rise as people increasingly turned to heroin\xa0and, more recently, illicitly manufactured fentanyl, often cut with street drugs such as methamphetamine.\xa0\r\nMore than 100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses during the 12 months following the COVID-19 lockdowns, the most overdose deaths ever recorded in\xa0a\xa0one-year span, according to\xa0the CDC.\r\nThe\xa0100,306 drug overdose deaths during the 12 months ending in April\xa0was a jump of 28.5% from the 78,056 deaths during the same period one year\xa0before and\xa0more than double\xa0the number of deaths each year from vehicle crashes, according to the most recent National Center for Health Statistics estimates released by the CDC in November.\r\nSome project those drug deaths will continue to rise. A\xa0study published this month in The Lancet\xa0projected 1.2 million would die from overdose deaths in the U.S. and Canada through 2029\xa0unless leaders enact evidence-based public health policies.\r\nKeith Humphreys, a Stanford University psychiatry and behavioral sciences professor who chaired a commission that published The Lancet study, said it\'s important to tailor policies to a patient\'s individual circumstances rather than adopt a blanket approach for all.\xa0\r\n""The commission absolutely did not endorse unilaterally kicking pain patients off their medication, which can cause significant harm,"" Humphreys said. ""Our focus was on evidence-based opioid stewardship, which is much more about not putting new patients on opioids in the first place"" and\xa0helping existing opioid patients\xa0taper to lower doses.\r\nMore: Drug overdoses surged amid COVID lockdowns; more deaths in one year than ever before\r\nThe Biden administration has sought to curb the addiction\xa0crisis with a four-part strategy\xa0that aims to slow the nation\'s spiraling\xa0overdose deaths.\r\nThe plan seeks to prevent substance-use\xa0disorder, expand medication-assisted treatment for people with opioid addiction\xa0and\xa0support people in recovery from addiction.\xa0The plan\xa0also\xa0make\xa0the opioid overdose-reversal drug naloxone widely available, expand\xa0access to test strips that can detect fentanyl, and support\xa0programs that supply clean needles to prevent the transmission of HIV and hepatitis C.\xa0\r\nKen Alltucker is on Twitter as\xa0@kalltucker\xa0or can be emailed at\xa0alltuck@usatoday.com.\r\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/02/10/cdcs-opioid-prescribing-guide-differs-new-existing-pain-sufferers/6719364001/': ""{'PERSON': ['Christopher Jones', 'Joshua Sharfstein', 'Keith Humphreys', 'Ken Alltucker'], 'DATE': ['Nov. 17', '2016', '60 days', '2016', '2019', '2012', '2016', '12 months', 'April', 'one year', '2029'], 'LOC': ['U.S.', 'Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health', 'New England', 'Stanford University'], 'ORG': ['Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'CDC', 'National Center for Injury Prevention and Control', 'Medicaid', 'National Center for Health Statistics', 'The Lancet', 'Stanford University'], 'PROGRAMS': ['New guidance on prescribing opioids', 'nationwide drop in pain pill prescriptions'], 'IMPACT': ['More than 100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses', 'nationwide drop in pain pill prescriptions', 'increasingly turned to heroin and, more recently, illicitly manufactured fentanyl', '100,306 drug overdose deaths during the 12 months', 'jump of 28.5% from the 78,056 deaths', 'risks, which can include addiction, overdose, heart trouble, broken bones or falls', 'opioid prescriptions began declining in 2012']}""}"

This notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) solicits applications to address understudied areas of opportunity that, if researched, could create the foundation needed to inform a prevention infrastructure for ongoing delivery and sustainment of interventions to prevent opioid and other substance misuse and use disorders.\r\nThis NOFO is a companion to RFA-DA-24-067 which also solicits applications relevant to the focus area. Applicants should note the difference between these NOFOs. This NOFO,\xa0RFA-DA-24-066 solicits phased awards, which are most appropriate for projects that require 1-2 years for preparatory work such as collecting pilot data; obtaining and integrating existing data sets; building stakeholder engagement; developing, adapting, and testing the feasibility of key components of implementation strategies; building necessary infrastructure to support a larger trial; or similar activities upon which the subsequent phase would be dependent. Phased awards do not require pilot or feasibility data at the time of submission. Awards made under this NOFO\xa0may transition to the second (R33) phase to conduct a larger study upon successfully meeting relevant milestones in the R61 phase. In contrast, RFA-DA-24-067 solicits R01 applications that already have relevant preliminary, pilot, or feasibility data.\r\nBackground\r\nThe NIH HEAL Initiative: This NOFO is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain management. More information about the HEAL Initiative is available at:\u202fhttps://heal.nih.gov/.\r\nThe importance of prevention in combating the opioid crisis is clear – identifying and implementing effective strategies to prevent the onset of opioid misuse and use disorder can yield\xa0positive individual, societal, and financial benefits and decrease the need for treatment services. In 2020, 9.5 million people aged 12 or older reported misusing opioids in the past year (National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2021), indicating that there are millions of people whose trajectories could have been changed, had they been exposed to an effective prevention strategy. Recent HEAL-funded research suggests that some risk factors for opioid misuse tend to be similar to risks for using other substances, and initiation of other substance use (e.g., cannabis) may precede initiation of opioid use in some populations. Previous and ongoing studies have developed and are testing innovative prevention approaches to address the range of individual, social, and environmental motivations for using non-prescription opioids, relevant to and effective for diverse populations.\xa0\r\nWhile there are effective prevention strategies, those strategies may not be widely implemented in practice. One of the biggest barriers to the wide-scale implementation of opioid and other substance use prevention interventions is the lack of infrastructure at the national and state levels to support prevention service delivery. Prevention programs are often embedded in broader systems or settings (e.g., schools, justice settings, social service settings, community behavioral health centers) and, therefore, may be competing with other services for time and resources. In addition to limited resources, the scope and competencies needed for a prevention workforce are not well-defined. Finally, when prevention resources exist, those allocating the funding may not have information regarding evidence-based programs and practices, and therefore they may not require their use. This may result in state agencies distributing the small amount of federal and state funds they receive for prevention to localities with varying guidance on how it can most effectively be used.\r\nDefinition of prevention: For this NOFO, the focus is selective or indicated prevention strategies.\xa0The scope of this NOFO\xa0is services related research to inform the delivery of strategies or programs that reduce risks for substance misuse, prevent initiation, or prevent escalation to substance use disorder (SUD) among individuals who are at-risk or already misusing substances (for additional information on the definition of intervention levels see:\xa0https://nap.nationalacademies.org/resource/25552/Prevention%20Models%20-%20FINAL.pdf)\r\nResearch Objectives\r\nTo ensure existing prevention intervention research efforts have a broad public health impact, research is needed to identify pathways for effective prevention strategies to be adopted and funded for wide-scale delivery. Thus, the goal of this initiative is to support research to address service delivery related questions.\xa0Projects submitted in response to this NOFO may define research to inform the establishment of a prevention infrastructure in one of two ways –\r\n<ol><li>Research on strategies to implement and sustain evidence-based prevention services, so they are embedded within existing systems and settings (e.g., healthcare, child welfare, justice, education), facilitating the ongoing delivery of prevention services by adapting programs to setting, using natural providers and leveraging existing resources within the system or setting; OR</li><li>Research to understand how to best develop and maintain an independent prevention workforce and delivery system that the settings/systems noted above can utilize to ‘refer’ individuals or families to for the receipt of preventive services when they may be experiencing risk for opioid or other substance use.</li></ol>Example areas of research interest include, but are not limited to:\xa0 \xa0\r\n<ul><li>Developing and testing approaches to the implementation, sustainability and scale-up of effective interventions to prevent opioid and other substance misuse and use disorder, including the testing of strategies to build infrastructure and capacity to deliver prevention services within diverse systems and settings.</li><li>Research to examine scientific solutions to prevention workforce capacity challenges, including developing and testing new approaches to training and retaining prevention workforce personnel (e.g., prevention practitioners, intervention implementers), task shifting and identifying opportunities to integrate prevention service delivery into a variety of staff positions, and strategies to build centralized, community-based prevention systems and workforces.\xa0</li><li>Developing and testing innovative strategies and models for optimizing key implementation processes: identifying intervention core components, adaptation and customization, implementation fidelity, and organizational or system level strategies to enhance uptake and sustainability of evidence based preventive interventions.</li><li>Research to leverage technology and/or direct to consumer\'s strategies to facilitate access to preventive care – this may include increased use of smartphone\xa0/mobile technology, use of social media for intervention delivery, or other methods as appropriate.</li><li>Research to test the cost benefits/offsets and cost effectiveness of investment in prevention infrastructure and evidence-based interventions, including broad investment and benefits at the community or population level.</li><li>Studies examining the impact of evidence-based practice registries and other decision-making tools on uptake of evidence-based interventions and the longer-term impact on preventing substance use and promoting public health.</li><li>Strategies that seek to improve quality, availability, and utility of data that can be used to track the extent of program implementation and/or receipt of services within or between systems.\xa0</li></ul>Proposed research under this NOFO must move beyond descriptive studies that simply identify factors that facilitate or impede the delivery of effective preventive services. Rather, applications should seek to develop and test systematic strategies for the implementation and sustainability of effective strategies to prevent opioid and other substance misuse and/or use disorder, and strategies to reduce risk for overdose among individuals who do not meet the criteria for SUD. To ensure sustainability of service delivery strategies tested, applicants should partner with communities and localities who use existing funds (e.g., federal block grant and demonstration grants; settlement funds; private foundations) to support evidence-based prevention programs and leverage those resources as the foundation for building infrastructure. Research should be designed in such a way that there is a high probability that interventions delivered can be scaled and sustained after the study period ends.\r\nMethodology used should accelerate the translation of findings generated by the proposed research into practice. To maximize the acceptability, feasibility, scalability and sustainability of prevention services being studied, applicants\u202fmust engage relevant end users\xa0in study conceptualization, design, execution, and interpretation. For the purpose of this NOFO, end user is broadly defined and may include policymakers, state and local level decision makers, practitioners, intervention implementers, families, youth, and community members. Applications proposing to embed an intervention within a specific setting should consider\xa0the potential generalizability of the proposed service delivery model (i.e., is the model specific to the intervention and setting being tested or is it a framework that could generalize to other prevention programs and settings). Attention should be paid to health disparities and inequities and their relevance to the interventions or services being studied.\r\nThis NOFO will not accept\xa0applications that seek to develop and test the efficacy of novel prevention intervention strategies. However, in most instances an intervention will be delivered in order to evaluate the services related research question. Data on an intervention’s effectiveness may be collected in the context of evaluating the services related research questions. Research that tests adaptations to the delivery platforms of existing interventions may also be submitted through this NOFO. This NOFO will not support overdose prevention or harm reduction strategies for individuals with SUD, but applicants may propose prevention services or infrastructure research that includes consideration for community-level risks of overdose among those at risk for initiation of use or who have initiated substance use but do not meet criteria for SUD.\r\nPhases of the Award &amp; Milestones\r\nThis funding opportunity uses a R61/R33 Exploratory/Developmental Phased Award mechanism. Support will be provided for up to 6 years, which includes initial support of up to 2 years of the R61 phase, followed by up to 5 years of support for the R33 phase upon successfully meeting R61 milestones.\r\nThis mechanism is provided to facilitate research for which preliminary data is not available, including high risk/high reward research. However, even for high risk/high reward research, applicants must provide a clear vision for how the research would progress if successful. The R61 phase is a planning phase that will support activities that demonstrate feasibility. It is expected that work during this phase will largely focus on issues related to (1) collecting feasibility or pilot data for a clinical trial, (2) stakeholder engagement to ensure support, sustainability, scalability, etc.; (3) testing hypotheses for which preliminary data is not otherwise available; or (4) demonstrating ability to build necessary infrastructure. Applications must delineate milestones that signify the completion of major elements that demonstrate readiness to proceed to a larger scale project in the second phase (e.g., successful piloting of an intervention or intervention component; accessing or improving timeliness of a specific dataset; establishing Memoranda of Understanding [MOU] with key stakeholders, etc.). See Part 2. Section IV “Other Project Information” below for instructions on submission of the milestone plan.\r\nFor transition to the R33 phase, awardees must submit the transition package at least\xa075 days prior to the anticipated start date of\xa0the R33 phase. The transition plan should include the R61 progress report describing in detail the progress towards the R61 milestones and a description of how research proposed for the R33 phase will be supported by the completion of the R61 phase milestones. These materials will be evaluated by NIH program staff to determine if the milestones were met.\r\nTransition to the R33 phases requires administrative review by NIH staff and is not guaranteed. R33 funding decisions will be based on the original R61/R33 peer review recommendations, successful completion of transition milestones, any proposed changes to the R33 research based on R61 findings, program priorities, and availability of funds. It is not expected that all applications will continue to the R33 phase.\r\nPre-Application Consultation\r\nPotential applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with appropriate NIH Program staff early in the application development process. This early contact will provide an opportunity to discuss and clarify NIH policies and guidelines, including the scope of the project relative to the HEAL initiative mission and the intent of this NOFO.\r\nSpecial Considerations:\r\nNational Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) applicants are strongly encouraged to review the guidelines and adhere to the requirements applicable to their research listed in the\xa0Special Considerations for NIDA Funding Opportunities and Awards. Upon award, these considerations will be included in the Notice of Grant Award.\r\nApplications Not Responsive to this NOFO:\r\nThe following applications will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed:\r\n<ul><li>Applications that do not address research questions related to implementation, sustainability or scale-up of prevention services or the development of a prevention infrastructure</li><li>Applications testing novel preventive interventions; studies examining the efficacy of a prevention program</li><li>Applications that do not involve a prevention focus, where prevention is defined as any program or strategy whose purpose is to\xa0reduce risks for substance misuse, prevent initiation, or prevent escalation to SUD\xa0among individuals who are at-risk or already misusing substances (for additional information on the definition of intervention levels see:\xa0https://nap.nationalacademies.org/resource/25552/Prevention%20Models%20-%20FINAL.pdf).</li><li>Studies focused on sustainability and implementation of SUD treatment or treatment adherence related research will not be considered under this NOFO.</li><li>Applications that do not include a plan for the meaningful engagement of end users as partners in the research process.</li><li>Applications that do not include a Milestone\xa0Plan (see\xa0Part 2. Section IV “Other Project Information” below for instructions on submission of the milestone plan)</li></ul>There are also opportunities to harmonize data within the broader NIH HEAL Initiative. Applicants selected for funding should expect to have a conversation with NIH program staff early in their project regarding high priority areas for potential harmonization.\r\nDiversity: In addition to scientific diversity, applicants should strive to incorporate diversity in their team development plan. Research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogeneous teams. Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. There are many benefits that flow from a diverse NIH-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust.\xa0In spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. NIH encourages institutions to diversify their student and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences. Please refer to Notice of NIH\'s Interest in Diversity\xa0NOT-OD-20-031\xa0for more details.\xa0\r\nEngaging People with Lived Experience and Other Collaborators: People with lived experience (e.g., patients, patient advocates, caregivers, families, community leaders) have important insights that can improve meaningful outcomes, uptake of research findings, and health equity across the continuum of research from basic through implementation studies. The perspectives of other relevant collaborators (e.g., health service providers, payors, public health agencies, community-based organizations, biotech, Pharma) can further improve research impact. The NIH HEAL initiative strongly encourages applicants to specify their plan for meaningful engagement of people with lived experience and other collaborators in the research process. Meaningful engagement will vary with the focus of the research but should at minimum ensure that researchers are connecting with relevant collaborators and incorporating their perspectives throughout the conception, implementation, and dissemination of the research.\xa0Meaningful engagement should address what the researchers will learn and how the people with lived experience and/or collaborators will benefit from the partnership. To promote health equity, as is relevant for the research proposed, it is recommended that at least two people with lived experience from populations who experience health disparities should be meaningfully engaged in these efforts \xa0.\xa0See this resource for more information in engaging people with lived experience:\xa0https://aspe.hhs.gov/lived-experience).\xa0\r\nPI Meeting Attendance\r\nThe NIH HEAL Initiative will require a high level of coordination and sharing between investigators. It is expected that NIH HEAL Initiative awardees will cooperate and coordinate their activities after awards are made by participating in Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) meetings, including an annual HEAL Investigators Meeting, as well as other activities.\r\nClinical Trial Accrual\xa0\r\nThis NOFO will support applications that include a series of milestones for completion of the clinical trial (if proposed) and provide contingency plans to proactively confront potential delays or disturbances in attaining the milestones. Continuation of the award is conditional upon satisfactory progress, availability of funds, and scientific priorities of the HEAL Initiative. If, at any time, recruitment falls significantly below the projected milestones for recruitment, NIH will consider ending support and negotiating an orderly phase-out of the award. NIH retains the option of periodic external peer review of progress. NIH program staff will closely monitor progress at all stages for milestones, accrual, and safety.\xa0\r\nSee Section VIII. Other Information for award authorities and regulations.\r\nInvestigators proposing NIH-defined clinical trials may refer to the Research Methods Resources website for information about developing statistical methods and study designs.\r\nGrant: A support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.\r\nApplication Types Allowed \r\nNew\r\nResubmission\r\nRevision\r\nThe\xa0OER Glossary\xa0and the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide provide details on these application types. Only those application types listed here are allowed for this NOFO.\r\nOptional: Accepting applications that either propose or do not propose clinical trial(s).\r\nFunds Available and Anticipated Number of Awards \r\nThe NIH HEAL Initiative intends to commit an estimated total of $4,650,000\xa0in FY2024 for this NOFO and the companion NOFO, RFA-DA-24-067, pending availability of funds and receipt of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.\r\nApplication budgets are not limited but need to reflect the actual needs of the proposed project. Unless well-justified, it is strongly recommended that applicants not request a budget of more than $300,000 in direct costs per year for the R61 phase and $750,000 in direct costs per year for the R33 phase of the project.\xa0\r\nThe scope of the project should determine the project period for each phase. The maximum period of the combined R61 and R33 phases is 6 years, with a maximum of 2 years for the R61 phase and maximum of 5 years for the R33 phase of the project. Applicants are encouraged to streamline the project period to complete the research as efficiently as possible.It is recommended that the R33 phase not exceed 4 years unless exceptionally well justified.\r\nNIH grants policies as described in the NIH Grants Policy Statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made from this NOFO.\r\n1.

Conformance to the requirements in the Application Guide is required and strictly enforced. Applications that are out of compliance with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.\r\nLetter of Intent\r\nAlthough a letter of intent is not required, is not binding, and does not enter into the review of a subsequent application, the information that it contains allows IC staff to estimate the potential review workload and plan the review.\r\nBy the date listed in Part 1. Overview Information, prospective applicants are asked to submit a letter of intent that includes the following information:\r\n<ul><li>Descriptive title of proposed activity</li><li>Name(s), address(es), and telephone number(s) of the PD(s)/PI(s)</li><li>Names of other key personnel</li><li>Participating institution(s)</li><li>Number and title of this funding opportunity</li></ul>The letter of intent should be sent to:\xa0NIDALetterofIntent@mail.nih.gov\r\nAll page limitations described in the SF424 Application Guide and the Table of Page Limits must be followed.\r\nThe following section supplements the instructions found in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide and should be used for preparing an application to this NOFO.\r\nAll instructions in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide must be followed.\r\nAll instructions in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide must be followed.\r\nAll instructions in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide must be followed, with the following additional instructions:\xa0\r\nTimeline &amp; Milestone Plan (Required - 2 page maximum)\r\nApplicants must include an Other Attachment entitled “Timeline and Milestone Plan,” clearly specifying proposed milestones and when those milestones are expected to be achieved. Milestones should be specific, quantifiable, and scientifically justified; they should establish the feasibility or empirical basis for pursuing the R33 phase of the study. Milestones should not simply be a restatement of the specific aims for the R61 phase. For applications where there is no preliminary data or where new partnerships are proposed, applicants should be especially attentive to proposing milestones that will help establish the feasibility of their proposed R33 project.\r\nExamples of Milestones for the R61 Phase:\r\n<ul><li>Fully executed MOUs, letters of support, and data sharing agreements, as relevant to the goals of the study, from partnering departments, agencies or stakeholders</li><li>Demonstration of active engagement and partnership with key entities and stakeholders \xa0</li><li>If preliminary data was not included in original application, preliminary data demonstrating feasibility of R33 phase must be included.</li></ul>\r\nAll instructions in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide must be followed.\r\nR&amp;R Budget\r\nAll instructions in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide must be followed, with the following additional instructions:\xa0\r\nHEAL Investigators’ Meeting:\xa0For budgeting purposes, include travel costs to support the attendance of one PD/PI (one person) at a 2-day, in-person HEAL Investigators meeting in the Washington DC area, annually for the duration of the award.\r\nAdditionally, NIH program staff may wish to periodically convene award recipients\xa0under this program, both virtually and in person. To plan for potential in-person meetings, budgets should include funds for travel for up to three\xa0people to participate in a 2-day meeting in the Washington DC every other year, beginning with the first year of award.\r\nR&amp;R Subaward Budget\r\nAll instructions in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide must be followed.\r\nAll instructions in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide must be followed.\r\nAll instructions in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide must be followed, with the following additional instructions:\r\nSpecific Aims:\r\nIn the single page attachment allowed for the specific aims, applicants should provide an overview of the overarching research question of interest as well as include clearly marked headers for “R61 Specific Aims” and “R33 Specific Aims” with brief descriptions of the aims specific to each phase of the study.\r\nResearch Strategy:\r\nThe Research Strategy should present an overview of the state of the science, current status and relevance of the proposed activities, and consideration of long-term sustainability and scalability of the proposed efforts.\r\nThe following criteria should be addressed:\r\nSignificance:\r\nThe R61 and R33 should coherently address a single set of research questions and goals, with the R61 phase establishing feasibility and necessary data to support transition to the R33 phase. Given this tight integration, only one Significance section is needed.\r\nInnovation:\r\n Only one Innovation section is needed. The Innovation section should explain how the proposed project, if successful, would lead to innovations that could help accelerate the dissemination, implementation and sustainability of prevention services and/or inform the development of an infrastructure thought which prevention services could be implemented.\r\nApproach:\r\nThe application should contain two approach sections, one for each phase as described below. It is not necessary to repeat any information or details in the R33 section that are described in the R61 section. Applications\xa0must also include a Timeline &amp; Milestone plan\r\n\xa0as an attachment as described in the SF424(R&amp;R) Other Project Information. Preliminary data is\xa0not\r\n\xa0required,\xa0nor\r\n\xa0is it required that teams have worked together previously. The phased award approach allows for earlier stage high risk/high reward projects. Applications without preliminary data should have a strong scientific premise and establish a strong rationale for how solving the challenges outlined in the application would improve the delivery of prevention intervention services.\r\nThe approach section must address the following elements in the phase most appropriate to the proposed study:\r\n<ul><li>Discussion of methodology selected; methods may include implementation science, hybrid implementation/effectiveness studies, and dissemination research designs.</li><li>A strategy for the meaningful engagement of relevant end users (e.g.,\xa0policymakers, state and local level decision makers, practitioners, intervention implementers, families, youth, and community members)\xa0as partners, and plans for utilizing their expertise and perspectives.\xa0</li><li>Discussion of the sustainability of the proposed service delivery model with respect to funding and staffing should it prove to be successful; this may include a plan for how the services may be sustained or scaled after the study period ends.</li><li>Considerations relevant to the potential generalizability of the proposed service delivery model, i.e., discussion of the model’s specificity to the selected intervention/prevention program and setting versus a framework that could be adapted for other programs and settings.\xa0</li><li>Strategies for addressing health disparities and inequities and the relevance to the interventions or services being studied.\xa0</li></ul>R61 Approach:\r\n\xa0The focus of the R61 phase is the pilot/foundational work needed to inform the larger study proposed in the R33. The R61 Approach section application should detail the strategies that will be taken in order to meet the milestones proposed in order to transition to the R33 phase.\r\nR33 Approach\r\nAlthough the Research Strategy for the R33 Phase is expected to be broad and flexible due to the nature of the exploratory research in the R61 Phase, the research strategy for the R33 phase of the award should be described in enough detail for reviewers to evaluate the merit of this component of the application, based on anticipated results.\r\nThe R33 phase may include a clinical trial if appropriate for the research questions and study design. Applications that propose a clinical trial in the R33 phase should include relevant information for the proposed clinical trial in the clinical trial attachment. As with milestones, the overall design of the R33 may be modified based on findings from the R61 phase, if appropriate. Any such modifications must be discussed in advance with NIH program staff and would be included in the transition application to be submitted towards the end of the R61 phase.\r\nResource Sharing Plan:\r\nIndividuals are required to comply with the instructions for the Resource Sharing Plans as provided in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide, with the following additional instructions:\xa0\r\nOther Plan(s):\r\nNote: Effective for due dates on or after January 25, 2023, the Data Management and Sharing Plan will be attached in the Other Plan(s) attachment in FORMS-H application forms packages.\r\nAll instructions in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide must be followed, with the following additional instructions:\r\n<ul><li>All applicants planning research (funded or conducted in whole or in part by NIH) that results in the generation of scientific data are required to comply with the instructions for the Data Management and Sharing Plan.

Additional information may be found in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide.\r\nSee more tips for avoiding common errors.\r\nUpon receipt, applications will be evaluated for completeness and compliance with application instructions by the Center for Scientific Review and responsiveness by components of participating organizations, NIH. Applications that are incomplete, non-compliant and/or nonresponsive will not be reviewed.\r\nApplicants are required to follow the instructions for post-submission materials, as described in the policy\r\n1. Criteria\r\nOnly the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. \xa0Applications submitted to the NIH in support of the NIH mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system.\r\nA proposed Clinical Trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. Additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation.\r\nOverall Impact\r\nReviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).\r\nScored Review Criteria\r\nReviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.\r\nSignificance\r\nDoes the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? Is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?\r\nIn addition, for applications involving clinical trials\r\nAre the scientific rationale and need for a clinical trial to test the proposed hypothesis or intervention well supported by preliminary data, clinical and/or preclinical studies, or information in the literature or knowledge of biological mechanisms? For trials focusing on clinical or public health endpoints, is this clinical trial necessary for testing the safety, efficacy or effectiveness of an intervention that could lead to a change in clinical practice, community behaviors or health care policy? For trials focusing on mechanistic, behavioral, physiological, biochemical, or other biomedical endpoints, is this trial needed to advance scientific understanding?\r\nInvestigator(s)\r\nAre the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi-PD/PI, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance, and organizational structure appropriate for the project?\r\nIn addition, for applications involving clinical trials\r\nWith regard to the proposed leadership for the project, do the PD/PI(s) and key personnel have the expertise, experience, and ability to organize, manage and implement the proposed clinical trial and meet milestones and timelines? Do they have appropriate expertise in study coordination, data management and statistics?

"{'Three years ago, while the nation’s attention was on the 2020 presidential election, voters in Oregon took a dramatic step back from America’s long-running War on Drugs. By a 17-point margin, Oregonians approved Ballot Measure 110, which eliminated criminal penalties for possessing small amounts of any drug, including cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine. When the policy went into effect early the next year, it lifted the fear of prosecution for the state’s drug users and launched Oregon on an experiment to determine whether a long-sought goal of the drug-policy reform movement—decriminalization—could help solve America’s drug problems.Early results of this reform effort, the first of its kind in any state, are now coming into view, and so far, they are not encouraging. State leaders have acknowledged faults with the policy’s implementation and enforcement measures. And Oregon’s drug problems have not improved. Last year, the state experienced one of the sharpest rises in overdose deaths in the nation and had one of the highest percentages of adults with a substance-use disorder. During one two-week period last month, three children under the age of 4 overdosed in Portland after ingesting fentanyl.For decades, drug policy in America centered on using law enforcement to target people who sold, possessed, or used drugs—an approach long supported by both Democratic and Republican politicians. Only in recent years, amid an epidemic of opioid overdoses and a national reconsideration of racial inequities in the criminal-justice system, has the drug-policy status quo begun to break down, as a coalition of health workers, criminal-justice-reform advocates, and drug-user activists have lobbied for a more compassionate and nuanced response. The new approach emphasizes reducing overdoses, stopping the spread of infectious disease, and providing drug users with the resources they need—counseling, housing, transportation—to stabilize their lives and gain control over their drug use.Oregon’s Measure 110 was viewed as an opportunity to prove that activists’ most groundbreaking idea—sharply reducing the role of law enforcement in the government’s response to drugs—could work. The measure also earmarked hundreds of millions of dollars in cannabis tax revenue for building a statewide treatment network that advocates promised would do what police and prosecutors couldn’t: help drug users stop or reduce their drug use and become healthy, engaged members of their communities. The day after the measure passed, Kassandra Frederique, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, one of the nation’s most prominent drug-policy reform organizations, issued a statement calling the vote a “historic, paradigm-shifting win” and predicting that Oregon would become “a model and starting point for states across the country to decriminalize drug use.”[Sam Quinones: America’s approach to addiction has gone off the rails]But three years later, with rising overdoses and delays in treatment funding, even some of the measure’s supporters now believe that the policy needs to be changed. In a nonpartisan statewide poll earlier this year, more than 60 percent of respondents blamed Measure 110 for making drug addiction, homelessness, and crime worse. A majority, including a majority of Democrats, said they supported bringing back criminal penalties for drug possession. This year’s legislative session, which ended in late June, saw at least a dozen Measure 110–related proposals from Democrats and Republicans alike, ranging from technical fixes to full restoration of criminal penalties for drug possession. Two significant changes—tighter restrictions on fentanyl and more state oversight of how Measure 110 funding is distributed—passed with bipartisan support.Few people consider Measure 110 “a success out of the gate,” Tony Morse, the policy and advocacy director for Oregon Recovers, told me. The organization, which promotes policy solutions to the state’s addiction crisis, initially opposed Measure 110; now it supports funding the policy, though it also wants more state money for in-patient treatment and detox services. As Morse put it, “If you take away the criminal-justice system as a pathway that gets people into treatment, you need to think about what is going to replace it.”Many advocates say the new policy simply needs more time to prove itself, even if they also acknowledge that parts of the ballot measure had flaws; advocates worked closely with lawmakers on the oversight bill that passed last month. “We’re building the plane as we fly it,” Haven Wheelock, a program supervisor at a homeless-services provider in Portland who helped put Measure 110 on the ballot, told me. “We tried the War on Drugs for 50 years, and it didn’t work … It hurts my heart every time someone says we need to repeal this before we even give it a chance.”\nWorkers from the organization Central City Concern hand out Narcan in Portland, Oregon, on April 5. (Jordan Gale)\r\n\nMeasure 110 went into effect at a time of dramatic change in U.S. drug policy. Departing from precedent, the Biden administration has endorsed and increased federal funding for a public-health strategy called harm reduction; rather than pushing for abstinence, harm reduction emphasizes keeping drug users safe—for instance, through the distribution of clean syringes and overdose-reversal medications. The term harm reduction appeared five times in the ballot text of Measure 110, which forbids funding recipients from “mandating abstinence.”Matt Sutton, the director of external relations for the Drug Policy Alliance, which helped write Measure 110 and spent more than $5 million to pass it, told me that reform advocates viewed the measure as the start of a nationwide decriminalization push. The effort started in Oregon because the state had been an early adopter of marijuana legalization and is considered a drug-policy-reform leader. Success would mean showing the rest of the country that “people did think we should invest in a public-health approach instead of criminalization,” Sutton said.To achieve this goal, Measure 110 enacted two major changes to Oregon’s drug laws. First, minor drug possession was downgraded from a misdemeanor to a violation, similar to a traffic ticket. Under the new law, users caught with up to 1 gram of heroin or methamphetamine, or up to 40 oxycodone pills, are charged a $100 fine, which can be waived if they call a treatment-referral hotline. (Selling, trafficking, and possessing large amounts of drugs remain criminal offenses in Oregon.) Second, the law set aside a portion of state cannabis tax revenue every two years to fund a statewide network of harm-reduction and other services. A grant-making panel was created to oversee the funding process. At least six members of the panel were required to be directly involved in providing services to drug users; at least two had to be active or former drug users themselves; and three were to be “members of communities that have been disproportionately impacted” by drug criminalization, according to the ballot measure.Backers of Measure 110 said the law was modeled on drug policies in Portugal, where personal drug possession was decriminalized two decades ago. But Oregon’s enforcement-and-treatment-referral system differs from Portugal’s. Users caught with drugs in Portugal are referred to a civil commission that evaluates their drug use and recommends treatment if needed, with civil sanctions for noncompliance. Portugal’s state-run health system also funds a nationwide network of treatment services, many of which focus on sobriety. Sutton said drafters of Measure 110 wanted to avoid anything that might resemble a criminal tribunal or coercing drug users into treatment. “People respond best when they’re ready to access those services in a voluntary way,” he said.Almost immediately after taking effect, Measure 110 encountered problems. A state audit published this year found that the new law was “vague” about how state officials should oversee the awarding of money to new treatment programs, and set “unrealistic timelines” for evaluating and funding treatment proposals. As a result, the funding process was left largely to the grant-making panel, most of whose members “lacked experience in designing, evaluating and administrating a governmental-grant-application process,” according to the audit. Last year, supporters of Measure 110 accused state health officials, preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic, of giving the panel insufficient direction and resources to handle a flood of grant applications. The state health authority acknowledged missteps in the grant-making process.The audit described a chaotic process, with more than a dozen canceled meetings, potential conflicts of interest in the selection of funding recipients, and lines of applicant evaluations left blank. Full distribution of the first biennial payout of cannabis tax revenue—$302 million for harm reduction, housing, and other services—did not occur until late 2022, almost two years after Measure 110 passed. Figures released by the state last month show that, in the second half of 2022, recipients of Measure 110 funding provided some form of service to roughly 50,000 “clients,” though the Oregon Health Authority has said that a single individual could be counted multiple times in that total. (A study released last year by public-health researchers in Oregon found that, as of 2020, more than 650,000 Oregonians required, but were not receiving, treatment for a substance-use disorder.)[From the May 2020 issue: America’s other epidemic]Meanwhile, the new law’s enforcement provisions have proved ineffectual. Of 5,299 drug-possession cases filed in Oregon circuit courts since Measure 110 went into effect, 3,381 resulted in a recipient failing to pay the fine or appear in court and facing no further penalties, according to the Oregon Judicial Department; about 1,300 tickets were dismissed or are pending. The state audit found that, during its first 15 months in operation, the treatment-referral hotline received just 119 calls, at a cost to the state of $7,000 per call. A survey of law-enforcement officers conducted by researchers at Portland State University found that, as of July 2022, officers were issuing an average of just 300 drug-possession tickets a month statewide, compared with 600 drug-possession arrests a month before Measure 110 took effect and close to 1,200 monthly arrests prior to the outbreak of COVID-19.“Focusing on these tickets even though they’ll be ineffective—it’s not a great use of your resources,” Sheriff Nate Sickler of Jackson County, in the rural southern part of the state, told me of his department’s approach.Advocates have celebrated a plunge in arrests. “For reducing arrests of people of color, it’s been an overwhelming success,” says Mike Marshall, the director of Oregon Recovers. But critics say that sidelining law enforcement has made it harder to persuade some drug users to stop using. Sickler cited the example of drug-court programs, which multiple studies have shown to be highly effective, including in Jackson County. Use of such programs in the county has declined in the absence of criminal prosecution, Sickler said: “Without accountability or the ability to drive a better choice, these individuals are left to their own demise.”The consequences of Measure 110’s shortcomings have fallen most heavily on Oregon’s drug users. In the two years after the law took effect, the number of annual overdoses in the state rose by 61 percent, compared with a 13 percent increase nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In neighboring Idaho and California, where drug possession remains subject to prosecution, the rate of increase was significantly lower than Oregon’s. (The spike in Washington State was similar to Oregon’s, but that comparison is more complicated because Washington’s drug policy has fluctuated since 2021.) Other states once notorious for drug deaths, including West Virginia, Indiana, and Arkansas, are now experiencing declines in overdose rates.In downtown Portland this spring, police cleared out what The Oregonian called an “open-air drug market” in a former retail center. Prominent businesses in the area, including the outdoor-gear retailer REI, have closed in recent months, in part citing a rise in shoplifting and violence. Earlier this year, Portland business owners appeared before the Multnomah County Commission to ask for help with crime, drug-dealing, and other problems stemming from a behavioral-health resource center operated by a harm-reduction nonprofit that was awarded more than $4 million in Measure 110 funding. In April, the center abruptly closed following employee complaints that clients were covering walls with graffiti and overdosing on-site. A subsequent investigation by the nonprofit found that a security contractor had been using cocaine on the job. The center reopened two weeks later with beefed-up security measures.Portland’s Democratic mayor, Ted Wheeler, went so far as to attempt an end run around Measure 110 in his city. Last month, Wheeler unveiled a proposal to criminalize public drug consumption in Portland, similar to existing bans on open-air drinking, saying in a statement that Measure 110 “is not working as it was intended to.” He added, “Portland’s substance-abuse problems have exploded to deadly and disastrous proportions.” Wheeler withdrew the proposal days later after learning that an older state law prohibits local jurisdictions from banning public drug use.Despite shifting public opinion on Measure 110, many Oregon leaders are not ready to give up on the policy. Earlier this month, Oregon Governor Tina Kotek signed legislation that strengthens state oversight of Measure 110 and requires an audit, due no later than December 2025, of about two dozen aspects of the measure’s performance, including whether it is reducing overdoses. Other bills passed by the legislature’s Democratic majority strengthened criminal penalties for possession of large quantities of fentanyl and mandated that school drug-prevention programs instruct students about the risks of synthetic opioids. Republican proposals to repeal Measure 110 outright or claw back tens of millions of dollars in harm-reduction funding were not enacted.The fallout from Measure 110 has received some critical coverage from media outlets on the right. “It is predictable,” a scholar from the Hudson Institute told Fox News. “It is a tragedy and a self-inflicted wound.” (Meanwhile, in Portugal, the model for Oregon, some residents are raising questions about their own nation’s decriminalization policy.) But so far Oregon’s experience doesn’t appear to have stopped efforts to bring decriminalization to other parts of the United States. “We’ll see more ballot initiatives,” Sutton, of the Drug Policy Alliance, said, adding that advocates are currently working with city leaders to decriminalize drugs in Washington, D.C.[Read: An anti-overdose drug is getting stronger. Maybe that’s a bad thing?]Supporters of Measure 110 are now seeking to draw attention to what they say are the policy’s overlooked positive effects. This summer, the Health Justice Recovery Alliance, a Measure 110 advocacy organization, is leading an effort to spotlight expanded treatment services and boost community awareness of the treatment-referral hotline. Advocates are also coordinating with law-enforcement agencies to ensure that officers know about local resources for drug users. “People are hiring for their programs; outreach programs are expanding, offering more services,” Devon Downeysmith, the communications director for the group, told me.An array of services around the state have been expanded through the policy: housing for pregnant women awaiting drug treatment; culturally specific programs for Black, Latino, and Indigenous drug users; and even distribution of bicycle helmets to people unable to drive to treatment meetings. “People often forget how much time it takes to spend a bunch of money and build services,” said Wheelock, the homeless-services worker, whose organization received more than $2 million in funding from Measure 110.Still, even some recipients of Measure 110 funding wonder whether one of the law’s pillars—the citation system that was supposed to help route drug users into treatment—needs to be rethought. “Perhaps some consequences might be a helpful thing,” says Julia Pinsky, a co-founder of Max’s Mission, a harm-reduction nonprofit in southern Oregon. Max’s Mission has received $1.5 million from Measure 110, enabling the organization to hire new staff, open new offices, and serve more people. Pinsky told me she is proud of her organization’s work and remains committed to the idea that “you shouldn’t have to go to prison to be treated for substance use.” She said that she doesn’t want drug use to “become a felony,” but that some people aren’t capable of stopping drug use on their own. “They need additional help.”Brandi Fogle, a regional manager for Max’s Mission, says her own story illustrates the complex trade-offs involved in reforming drug policy. Three and a half years ago, she was a homeless drug user, addicted to heroin and drifting around Jackson and Josephine Counties. Although she tried to stop numerous times, including one six-month period during which she was prescribed the drug-replacement medication methadone, she told me that a 2020 arrest for drug possession was what finally turned her life around. She asked to be enrolled in a 19-month drug-court program that included residential treatment, mandatory 12-step meetings, and a community-service project, and ultimately was hired by Pinsky.Since Measure 110 went into effect, Fogle said, she has gotten pushback from members of the community for the work Max’s Mission does. She said that both the old system of criminal justice and the new system of harm reduction can benefit drug users, but that her hope now is to make the latter approach more successful. “Everyone is different,” Fogle said. “Drug court worked for me because I chose it, and I wouldn’t have needed drug court in the first place if I had received the kind of services Max’s Mission provides. I want to offer people that chance.”': ""{'PERSON': ['Vivian Peng', 'Kassandra Frederique', 'Sam Quinones', 'Tony Morse', 'Haven Wheelock', 'Nate Sickler', 'Mike Marshall', 'Ted Wheeler', 'Tina Kotek', 'Matt Sutton', 'Devon Downeysmith', 'Julia Pinsky', 'Brandi Fogle'], 'DATE': ['Three years ago', '2020', 'this year', 'Earlier this month', 'December 2025', 'This summer', '2020', 'Three and a half years ago', 'last month', 'last year', 'Last month', 'this year', 'this spring', 'Last month', '2022', 'almost two years after Measure 110 passed', 'as of July 2022'], 'LOC': ['Oregon', 'America', 'Portland', 'Jackson County', 'Oregon', 'U.S.', 'Oregon', 'Justice Department', 'Portland', 'Oregon', 'Jackson County', 'Jackson County', 'Oregon', 'Idaho', 'California', 'Washington State', 'West Virginia', 'Indiana', 'Arkansas', 'Portland', 'Multnomah County', 'Portland', 'United States', 'Washington, D.C.', 'southern Oregon'], 'ORG': ['Drug Policy Alliance', 'Central City Concern', 'Drug Policy Alliance', 'Hudson Institute', 'Fox News', 'Health Justice Recovery Alliance', 'Max’s Mission'], 'PROGRAMS': ['Ballot Measure 110', 'resource hub', 'Measure 110', 'Measure 110', 'Measure 110', 'Measure 110', 'Measure 110', 'Measure 110', 'Measure 110', 'Measure 110', 'Measure 110', 'Measure 110 funding', 'Measure 110', 'Measure 110 funding', 'Measure 110', 'Measure 110', 'Measure 110'], 'IMPACT': ['eliminated criminal penalties for possessing small amounts of any drug', 'lifted the fear of prosecution for the state’s drug users and launched Oregon on an experiment to determine whether a long-sought goal of the drug-policy reform movement—decriminalization—could help solve America’s drug problems', 'State leaders have acknowledged faults with the policy’s implementation and enforcement measures', 'Oregon’s drug problems have not improved', 'Last year, the state experienced one of the sharpest rises in overdose deaths in the nation and had one of the highest percentages of adults with a substance-use disorder', 'the new policy simply needs more time to prove itself', 'Measure 110 was viewed as a major opportunity to prove that activists’ most groundbreaking idea—sharply reducing the role of law enforcement in the government’s response to drugs—could work', 'building a statewide treatment network', 'help drug users stop or reduce their drug use and become healthy, engaged members of their communities', 'the number of annual overdoses in the state rose by 61 percent', 'a plunge in arrests', 'The consequences of Measure 110’s shortcomings have fallen most heavily on Oregon’s drug users', 'distribution of bicycle helmets to people unable to drive to treatment meetings', 'housing for pregnant women awaiting drug treatment', 'culturally specific programs for Black, Latino, and Indigenous drug users', 'Max’s Mission has received $1.5 million from Measure 110, enabling the organization to hire new staff, open new offices, and serve more people', 'Both the old system of criminal justice and the new system of harm reduction can benefit drug users', 'in the second half of 2022, recipients of Measure 110 funding provided some form of service to roughly 50,000 “clients”']}""}"
"{'Analysis of 20 million clinical drug tests performed by Quest Diagnostics over the past decade shows increases in drug mixing and amphetamines use, and highlights the need for drug misuse prevention at the earliest stages of risk\r\nSECAUCUS, N.J., Dec. 12, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Quest Diagnostics (NYSE: DGX) released its latest Health Trends® report, ""Drug Misuse in America 2022: A Decade Lost to the Drug Crisis."" The report, which harnesses insights from\xa0more than 20 million clinical drug tests over 10 years, shows that while progress has been made in the last decade of drug misuse, patients of all ages and both sexes are still at risk.\r\nTo access the Health Trends report, visit\xa0Quest Diagnostics Newsroom - Health Trends®.\r\nThe findings reveal that while illicit fentanyl now causes most of overdose deaths, prescription drug misuse involving opioids and other controlled medications taken by patients under the care of a physician continues at a troubling rate. In 2021, nearly half (49%) of people tested showed evidence of prescription drug misuse, compared to 60% in 2012.\r\nAdditional key findings over the past 10 years include:\xa0\r\n<ul><li>Polysubstance use, or drug mixing, has increased. In 2021, 52% of drug tests showed evidence of drug mixing, a relative increase of 58% from 33% in 2012.</li><li>Use of amphetamines has surged 5-fold. In 2021, 9.2% of patients tested were positive for amphetamines, compared to 1.8% in 2012.</li><li>Though individuals of all ages misused medications and illicit drugs at high rates, younger individuals (ages 18-34 years) were more likely to show signs of misuse.</li><li>Of those tested, female patients were more likely to use pain-and-anxiety reducing prescription medications, such as opioids and benzodiazepines, while male patients had higher rates of illicit drugs, such as cocaine.</li></ul>""This year\'s Quest Diagnostics Health Trends® Report underscores the deeply entrenched pattern of prescription drug misuse,"" said report co-author Harvey W. Kaufman, M.D., Senior Medical Director and Head of the Health Trends Research Program for Quest Diagnostics. ""While today\'s policy debates about the drug crisis focus largely on reducing illicit fentanyl use, our nationally representative laboratory data is a stark reminder that even patients under a physician\'s care can be at significant risk of drug-related harms.""\r\n""As a pain specialist, it is beyond frustrating to see similar patterns of dangerous drug mixing and outright misuse today as those observed 10 years ago,"" said board-certified pain expert and report co-author Jeffrey Gudin, M.D., Senior Medical Advisor, Drug Monitoring, Quest Diagnostics. ""As providers and policy makers reflect on the CDC\'s new opioid prescribing guidelines, our laboratory data demonstrates that the medical community must do more to create a truly preventive care model for identifying early signs of prescription drug misuse, similar to screening programs for cancer, heart disease and diabetes.""\r\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently updated its opioid prescribing guidelines\xa0to improve the safety and effectiveness of\xa0pain care, including with prescription opioids. Among other recommendations, the guidance states that clinicians should consider clinical drug testing (toxicology testing) before staring opioids and periodically (at least annually) during opioid therapy when there is risk of overdose due to mixing with other controlled substances. The CDC also recommends that ""clinicians, practices, and health systems should aim to minimize bias in testing and should not apply this recommendation differentially on the basis of assumptions about patients.""\r\n""While our laboratory data does not provide insights based on racial or ethnic characteristics, it does clearly demonstrate that high rates of drug misuse are found in patients of all ages, both sexes and varying kinds of commercial and public health plan coverage,"" Dr. Gudin said. ""Put simply, patients from all walks of life are at risk of misuse. These findings bolster the CDC\'s recommendation that providers aim to reduce bias, such as by applying uniform standards in drug testing.""\r\nIn recent years, the prescription opioid crisis has morphed into an illicit fentanyl crisis, with fentanyl, a highly potent opioid, responsible for more than 70% of all overdose deaths today. Prescription opioids are still widely misused: as many as 13,500 overdose deaths were due to prescription opioids in 2021, versus approximately 16,000 in 2012. Polysubstance misuse, such as mixing one or more prescribed controlled medications, is highly prevalent, while deaths from stimulants such as amphetamines have climbed.\r\nAn estimated 108,000 deaths were due to drug overdose in the 12-months ending June 2022.\r\nFor more information on clinical drug testing and different types of tests, please visit Clinical.QuestDiagnostics.com/WhyClinicalDrugTesting.\r\nQuest Diagnostics Health Trends studies are performed on aggregate deidentified laboratory data in compliance with applicable privacy regulations and the company\'s strict privacy policies, and follow procedures approved by the WCG Institutional Review Board.

"{'When in municipal government do you actually get to plan for something that isnt a basic government service so many years out? she said.\r\nThe state has set clear limits on how the money can be spent, constraints that help ensure there wont be a budget fight every year over this money, LaChapelle said.\r\nMassachusetts expects to receive a total of $1 billion over 18 years from manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies through legal settlements over their role in triggering the epidemic of opioid addiction that continues to this day, claiming more than 2,300 lives in Massachusetts last year.\r\nSixty percent of the money is being deposited into the statewide Opioid Recovery and Remediation Fund, overseen by the state Executive Office of Health and Human Services and governed by a 20-member council of public health and addiction specialists.\r\nThe remaining 40 percent is being distributed among municipalities that sign an agreement to participate, with the dollar amount based on such factors as the number of opioid-related deaths and the amount of opioids flowing into that community. Cities and towns will continue to get payments for the next 17 years.\r\nThe agreement specifies that the money must be spent on treatment, recovery support, connecting people to care, harm reduction, services to people involved with the criminal justice system, support for pregnant or parenting women with opioid use disorder, and efforts to prevent opioid misuse.\r\nBoston, which has received $4.7 million of the $22 million it ultimately expects to receive, is seeking input directly from Boston residents, especially those with firsthand experience with the crisis.\r\nWe really believe that the use of the funding should be informed by the input of those whove been most impacted by the opioid epidemic, said Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, executive director of the Boston Public Health Commission.\r\nThe commission is conducting an online survey that anyone can fill out until Wednesday. It asks people to choose their priorities such as providing housing assistance or establishing recovery centers run by peers. The city is also holding focus groups, online and in person. It has completed six and plans to conduct up to 15.\r\nOjikutu expects to announce in September at least some use of the initial pot of money.\r\nAmong the possibilities are expanding harm reduction such as distributing clean syringes and fentanyl test strips around the city, expanding access to medications that treat opioid use disorder, developing new housing opportunities, and providing help to pregnant women.\r\nThe state has really encouraged us to think about innovation and filling gaps, fixing shortcomings in our system and our existing approaches and programs, Ojikutu said.\r\nOjikutu feels a sense of urgency, as opioid overdoses in the city increased 36 percent from 2019 to 2022, more than 50 percent of the deaths among people of color.\r\nWorcester, which has received $1.1 million so far, has used some of the money to launch a Mental Health Community Mobile Crisis Response pilot program, a spokesman said in an e-mail.\r\nDispatchers answering 911 calls that involve a mental health or substance use issue can summon a crisis team of mental health clinicians to deescalate a situation and connect the client to appropriate resources. Police can also call the team from their radios if they encounter someone in need of help, and the crisis teams can summon the police if necessary. Officials hope this will reduce arrests and emergency room visits involving people in mental health crises.\r\nIn Peabody, which expects to receive $2.7 million over the next 17 years and has $316,000 in hand, city officials have consulted community members with firsthand experience with drug addiction in their families, said Sara Grinnell, director of the citys new Division of Social Services.\r\nWhat everybody identified was that navigating the system that exists is very difficult, Grinnell said. Knowing where to go is very hard. You make phone calls, you dont get a call back right away,\r\nTo ease this problem, the city plans to hire a social worker and a care coordinator, expecting to post the job descriptions in a few weeks.\r\nThe city is also setting up a scholarship program for people who leave a treatment facility and need a place to stay, such as a sober house, until they are ready to transition to independent living. The city has set aside an initial$10,000 for this purpose, until the extent of the need becomes clear.\r\nIn Easthampton, a town of 16,000 between Holyoke and Northampton, health officials who have been talking with community members over the past year and a half have identified three services that are lacking: recovery coaches, literacy help, and transportation for people getting treatment. The town is partnering with advocacy groups and regional harm reduction coalitions to find ways to address these issues, said LaChapelle, the mayor. The town is also working with schools and the council on aging, recognizing that addiction strikes every demographic, she said.\r\nOne possibility is to establish a very discreet recovery center in Easthampton so people dont need to travel for care. The town will also collaborate with its neighbors on providing services, just as it did for COVID-19 testing and vaccinations.\r\nThe opioid settlement agreements, reached in 2021, were negotiated on a national level, and most require that the vast majority of the money is spent on addiction treatment and prevention. But theres no national oversight system to make sure that happens, and advocates worry that the money will go to approaches known to be ineffective or even to unrelated government functions.\r\nChristine Minhee, the founder of OpioidSettlementTracker.com, a website watchdogging how each state uses its opioid windfall, said that Massachusetts has put in place important guardrails by specifying that the money can be used solely to supplement and strengthen, rather than supplant existing services.\r\nThat doesnt exist in every states plan, Minhee said.\r\nMassachusetts is one of only 15 states that have pledged to reveal how 100 percent of the settlement money is spent.\r\nThe council overseeing the Opioid Recovery and Remediation Fund, established by a 2021 state law, holds several public meetings a year. The fund has already distributed millions of dollars to such efforts as naloxone distribution, fentanyl test strips, three new opioid treatment programs, a mobile methadone delivery program, student loan forgiveness, and supportive housing.

"{'Maine, like most states, is beginning to reopen as COVID-19 cases decline. But the collateral damage already done to people struggling with drugs and alcohol through anxiety, relapse, and death has been a heavy blow for the state and its recovery community.\r\nYou feel alone already, and then you throw in the fact that youre stuck at home, and you cant do anything, and you cant see anybody, said Ashley Reny, executive director of Journey House Recovery, which operates five group residences in Maine.\r\nSo, you go find an alternative. And when youre in that state of mind, youll do whatever you have to do to get what you want, she added in a phone interview.\r\nThe trend also is reflected in national statistics. In December, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 81,000 drug fatalities from June 2019 through May 2020, the largest number ever recorded for a 12-month period. In Massachusetts, the mortality increase was more modest, a 2.2 percent rise over the first nine months of 2020.\r\nWhen the arrival of COVID shut down the country last March, it also shut down many of the tools for recovery. In Maine, group meetings were canceled, and counseling was curtailed. And Zoom sessions, some based in faraway states, could not match the in-person support provided by a sponsor and other familiar faces.\r\nImagine youre in recovery and you want to engage. Imagine the challenge of doing that virtually, said Dr. Ron Springel, program manager for the Maine Association of Recovery Residences. How do you pick a sponsor youve never met?\r\nEric Skillings, a Sanford man who relapsed in 2019, said the virus has added a frightening degree of difficulty to thefight against addiction.\r\nYou get into a depression, and you cant socialize with certain people, said Skillings, 37. You just dig yourself into a hole, and you cant climb out of it.\r\nSkillings, who helped found Journey House, knows too well how recovery can collapse even for people who have worked for years to help themselves and others become sober.\r\nHis fiancee, Crystal Waugh, overdosed with him Jan. 30 in Sanford on a combination of fentanyl and Xanax, an anti-anxiety medication. Skillings survived; Waugh, 39, did not.\r\nI was lucky that God spared me, Skillings said. When I woke up, Crystal had passed away. I jumped off the couch and wiped the foam from her mouth.\r\nThe pandemic, Skillings said, compounded the dangers facing his fiancee, who once managed the Sanford womens residence for Journey House.\r\nShe was scared to go out. She got very depressed from de-socializing, and then the drug use just got worse and worse, he recalled.\r\nMy bottom is usually jail or prison. Her bottom was ultimately death, because she wasnt able to get the help she needed, Skillings said.\r\nWaughs death was the latest tragedy for the Journey House community. Jesse Harvey, a founder, died of an overdose Sept. 7 at the age of 28.\r\nIt didnt seem real when that happened, said River Joshua-David Banks, who runs the Journey House mens program in Lewiston. Here you have a person who put his neck out there for so many people. He gave so much of himself.\r\nSuch stories, many of them overwhelmed by the focus on COVID-19, were told over and over at last weekends memorial event in Portland. There, Courtney Allen held a black balloon for Tim Bellavance, a 53-year-old Augusta man who died of an overdose Aug. 8.\r\nBellavance had recently completed a drug court program and was digging bloodworms for a living. But the pandemic upended everything, said Allen, policy director for the Maine Recovery Advocacy Project.\r\nBellevance could not read or write and wasnt familiar with computers, Allen said. As a result, her friend lost access to Suboxone, a drug that helps prevent cravings for other opioids,becausehe could not join the providers mandatory video sessions.\r\nBellevance relapsed and died, Allen said.\r\nGordon Smith, the states director of opioid response, said last years record deaths were the result of a perfect storm that combined increasingly powerful drugs, predominantly fentanyl, and a pandemic that severed many support lines for recovery. Through Thursday, COVID had killed 723 people in Maine.\r\nIts certainly been disheartening, Smith said. Were doing everything by the book ... evidence-based, data-driven, and then were losing 10 people a week in Maine. Its unacceptable.\r\nSmith said the spike began at the end of 2019, before the pandemic. But the isolation that followed has exacerbated an epidemic within a pandemic.\r\nUnder Governor Janet Mills, the state haslaunched a wide-ranging campaign to reach people struggling with substance abuse, by expanding recovery services, for example, and working to reduce the stigma associated with the disease.\r\nThe initiatives are a major shift from previous governor Paul LePages approach to opioid abuse. Unlike Mills, who assumed office in 2019, LePage opposed broadening access to naloxone, a drug marketed as Narcan that reverses opioid overdoses.\r\nWhen Maines drug fatalities dropped to 354 in 2018 from 417 the previous year, some health officials believed that the state had turned a corner. But then the numbers began climbing again, to 380 in 2019 and the record high of last year.\r\nThe state now is publishing data every month on fatal overdoses, and its new campaign to save lives is focusing on high-risk groups such as the homeless, those who have left treatment, and the recently incarcerated.\r\nSo many people have lost someone they know, Smith said. When the imagery changes from somebody away in a big city whos a heroin addict to someone who could be your friends 17-year-old son who died in his bedroom, it dramatically changes the compassion and the stigma.\r\nAs COVID cases fall, group meetings and in-person counseling are reappearing.\r\nKari Morissette, who is in recovery, leads group sessions in Portland and is executive director of the Church of Safe Injection, an organization that Harvey, her friend who died, founded to distribute sterile needles and naloxone to drug users.\r\nIve been shot, Ive been stabbed, Im a human-trafficking survivor and a 28-time convicted felon, Morissette said. But I struggled with the shutdown. Youre alone with your head.\r\nNow, she is back with others, encouraging them toward a better way. Morissette wears a sweat shirt that says Hope Leader on its front. And as the virus begins to wane, the states opioid-response director said he is hopeful that overdose deaths will drop, too.\r\nIt should get better as we come out the other side of the pandemic, Smith said. But I almost feel that a year has been taken from me.\r\nBrian MacQuarrie can be reached at brian.macquarrie@globe.com.': ""{{'PERSON': ['Ashley Reny', 'Dr. Ron Springel', 'Eric Skillings', 'Crystal Waugh', 'Jesse Harvey', 'River Joshua-David Banks', 'Courtney Allen', 'Tim Bellavance', 'Gordon Smith', 'Janet Mills', 'Paul LePage', 'Kari Morissette', 'Brian MacQuarrie'], 'DATE': ['June 2019', 'May 2020', 'Jan. 30', 'Sept. 7', 'Aug. 8', 'last March', 'at the end of 2019', '2018', '2019', 'last year', 'last weekend', '17-year-old', 'Through Thursday', 'every month'], 'LOC': ['Maine', 'Journey House','Sanford', 'Massachusetts', 'Lewiston', 'Portland', 'Augusta'], 'ORG': ['US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Maine Association of Recovery Residences', 'Journey House', 'Maine Recovery Advocacy Project'], 'PROGRAMS': ['tools for recovery', 'drug court program', 'Maine’s drug fatalities', 'new campaign to save lives', 'zoom sessions', 'mandatory video sessions'], 'IMPACT': ['heavy blow for the state', 'anxiety, relapse, and death', 'recovery can collapse', 'lost access to Suboxone', 'severed many support lines for recovery', 'expanding recovery services', 'major shift from previous governor approach', 'increasing compassion and reducing the stigma']}}""}"
"{'FENTANYL KILLS. Thats what the billboard says. Thats all the billboard saysFENTANYL in a cold, light blue, KILLS in stark white against an all-black background. Below is a woman on a gurney, treated with the same dead-blue tones as the script above her. Shes covered to her armpits in a sheet, arms at her sides, awaiting an autopsy. Anyone who has seen a cop drama in the past 30 years knows the image.\r\nWhen an opioid user overdoses, their lips turn a cold, light blue. That was the color of my lips when I lay slumped in a pile outside the automatic doors of an emergency room. Jenny, the girl I had absconded from rehab with just days before, shouted for help, and once she saw the staff stir to action, jumped back in the car. Gustavo, who Jenny had guilted into driving, stepped on the gas, bald tires searching for traction before squealing to life, catapulting them into a night drowning in coastal fog. I imagined the diffuse light from cherry-red plastic growing faint, the EMERGENCY dissolving in their rearview. Im sure it was traumatic for them. Im sure they went back to our wretched motel room and immediately got high to blunt the terror. Thats what I would have done.\r\nSplashed across the bottom right-hand corner of the billboard are the insignia of several city agencies proudly supporting its message. What is noticeably absent is any reference to a single resourcenot a website, not a phone number, not a mention of how someone might stop using fentanyl and thus avoid their impending death. The billboard looms large over a dirt lot dotted with tarps and tents and other telltale signs of DIY shelters in a southwest Fresno neighborhood where residents already know that fentanyl kills. Theyve lost all manner of kin. In addition to the billboard there are several video spots that run on local television and YouTube: a daughter dies on the floor of her parents bathroom; a father sobs over the loss of his precious teenage son, collapsing into the arms of his wife and remaining children.\r\nDonnie, a friend of mine, died in a sober living house he once helped manage. I hadnt seen him in more than a year, but he was there for me when I was newly sober. He invited me to a gathering of young, sober men where they discussed the novel challenges facing them in the foreign land of abstinence. It turned out the group wasnt for meI didnt feel at home discussing MMA and motorcyclesbut I appreciated the gesture. Donnie and I remained friends, chatting frequently outside of meetings about skateboarding and getting locked up and being alive after almost being dead. A year later, when I learned he had overdosed, it stung in a way I wasnt prepared for. Donnie and I were very different, and we were the same. The thought that he wouldnt get another chance, not one more day, was devastating.\r\nThe billboard ad campaign is one of many tied to Californias $1 billion spending spree that is in part aimed at raising fentanyl awareness. In a local news interview, the Fresno superintendent of schools, who was charged with research and development for the project, seemed very pleased with himself. He wore the self-satisfied expression of a do-gooder doing good. He was proud of the message, touting his decision to ask local high schoolers for input, claiming that they had provided valuable information to help them target at-risk youth. In my experience, any teenager willing to work on an anti-drug campaign likely has no idea what at-risk teens need. Those at risk are not staying after school to brainstorm about what version of Just Say No is most potent; theyre off getting high somewhere.\r\nManystudies have been conducted on the effectiveness of fear-based abstinence programming, like DARE. The results are in: Fear does not reduce risky behavior in young people. Whether its drinking, puffing, fucking, snorting, or shooting, those most likely to engage in this kind of behavior are generally not moved by the spooky presentations given by the people who preach abstinence. And yet here are these billboards, millions and millions of dollars worth of them, sprouting up to the satisfaction of the well-meaners and the grim recognition of people who have, at some point or another, looked likely to become one of their cautionary tales. They are grand totems of denial to what might really stop these losses. No one is ready for that.\r\nPhoto illustration by Slate. Photos by County of Fresno and Getty Images Plus.\r\nEvery Friday at 10 a.m., my sixth-grade class gathered in the cafeteria. The officers uniform was tan and gold and blue, with crisp creases. He gave us all workbooks and lots of free swagpencils, bumper stickers, keychains. He taught us the deleterious effects of drug use, how one sip, puff, or sniff would ruin our lives forever. This all checked out, given the speeches I was getting at home.\r\nMy much older brother had started the emancipation process at 14, and subsequently went off to sip and snort and puff and play music and make art. Our mother cried about it openly and frequently, making me promisewhich I did, earnestlynever to engage in that kind of behavior. As such, I felt right at home in the DARE program, my hand constantly and confidently rocketing into the air with the answers to everything. My vehement support of abstinence earned me a gold medal made of bronzed metal. At 12, I was the absolute best at not doing drugs. By 14, if I was handed a pill and told it would make me feel goodor even just a little betterI swallowed it.\r\nBy 14, if I was handed a pill and told it would make me feel goodor even just a little betterI swallowed\xa0it.\r\nI also smoked a lot of weed. I found it helped soothe many of the symptoms associated with the myriad mental health diagnoses I had received. But for my mother and the psychiatrists, the idea that I would self-medicate was intolerable. They didnt want me to self-medicate; they wanted me to follow the medication regimen theyd prescribed. In no way am I knocking psychiatrypsychiatric medication has been profoundly life-altering for mebut I had to find that out for myself, years later. At 15, when I was handed all those diagnoses and the prescriptions that came with them, I felt powerless, forced to take what I perceived to be too many pills: Paxil and Seroquel and Zyprexa and Klonopin and Restoril, and on and on and on.\r\nIn America, there are two broad categories that drugs fall under: sanctioned and unsanctioned. Those who use the sanctioned drugs exactly the way they are told to are taking care of themselves. Those who use the unsanctioned drugs, or use sanctioned drugs in an unsanctioned fashion, are weak and sick and need help. In the United States, current drug policy is meant to stop unsanctioned drugs from entering the country, punish those who sell them, and force unsanctioned drug users to quit, often steering them toward the sanctioned drugs instead.\xa0 Because the supply of unsanctioned drugs is wholly unregulated, they often wind up doing much more damage than drugs made in laboratories with government oversight. And sanctioned drugs are simply far more expensive to procure and keep supplied. Many people who turn to fully unsanctioned drugs are trying to get relief for a whole lot cheaper than they can otherwise.\r\nBoth sanctioned and unsanctioned drugs can and do ruin lives and lead to death. (An obligatory rant about alcohol would typically come here, because it is a sanctioned drugas it should bebut it is also among the leading causes of preventable death in the United States.) Yet its unsanctioned drugs that usually capture the darker imagination of the public. Modern drug use epidemics that have real consequences for real people become entertainment, rife with sensationalized headlines that miss or misrepresent major aspects of whats happening, pretending to care about users while instead using their suffering to sell ads and supplement content for 24-hour news cycles. Current anti-drug legislation does something similar, with prosecutors across the nation dusting off laws created during the hysteria that accompanied the crack epidemic and retooling them for the current one. Teenagers with no intention of hurting anyone are being charged with murder for providing pills to their classmates. Thats not justice for the victimthats a head on a pike, a warning to people who sell unsanctioned drugs.\r\nIn truth, these overdose deaths are accidents that predominantly occur due to one key factor: the unregulated drug supply. Around the turn of the century, as prescription opioids began flooding American streets, overdoses did certainly rise; however, they did so at a much slower and steadier rate because the drugs were pharmaceutical grade and held to stringent FDA testing standards. When people bought an 80-milligram Oxycontin, they knew exactly what they were getting and in what quantity. It wasnt until that supply suddenly dried up that overdose deaths exploded. This is no surprise, given that the regulated, safer supply was replaced with an unregulated, unsafe supply of stronger drugs manufactured under dubious lab conditions.\r\nFentanyl itself isnt poisonit is a legitimate medication used in a wide variety of medical procedures every day. Anyone who has been put under for surgery has probably been on the stuff. But heres the thing about fentanyl: It is a fully synthetic opioid, meaning it can be produced in a lab with only chemicals, no finicky poppy crops needed. It is also quite a bit more potent than its cousins heroin, morphine, oxycodone, et al. This makes it easier to ship and distribute because every dose is of lower volume. Less is more. Around 2016, as doctors pulled back on prescribing opioids, labs in China began making fentanyl to fill the gap in supply. It was so cheap and so potent that cartels and street dealers started making counterfeit pills, buying presses so their product would look just like the prescription opioids their customers were familiar with. When a person is expecting a certain substance in a quantity theyre used to, but instead receives something much more potent, problems arise. Deaths occur. And right now, there is a whole lot of death.\r\nStatistics alone dont paint the full picture. When I read articles chock-full of stats, I stop seeing people. I see numbers. Im a person who does better with visuals. For instance, how wide, how deep, would a grave need to be to accommodate the nearly 300,000 overdose victims from the past few years? I conjure images from pandemics and warsdead upon dead upon dead. Where did they OD? At home? In a car? A bathroom? The airport? Work? Donnie was on his bunk bed. Wherever it happened, they were individual people, each one a life. Fresno County decided theyd amalgamate them into one likeness, approximate them on a billboard to remind those who dont need the reminder: FENTANYL KILLS.\r\nWhen I regained consciousness after my overdose, I was confused and pissed off. I had no idea where I was or why an intubation tube was being yanked from my throat. I started clawing at the mess of smaller tubes snaking from my veins. Nurses tried to hold me to the bed and talked sweetly to me. Their tone shifted when I asked the doctor if I was required by law to stay in the hospital. He cautioned me, strongly, against leaving, but also said he couldnt keep me there. In my small town, the police often showed up in ERs to questionand sometimes arrestoverdose victims. As I put on my pants, soaking wet from an ice bath at the motel (Jenny and Gustavos first attempt to reverse my overdose), and one remaining shoe, the nurses were angry. Ungrateful little shit, one of them muttered, side-eyeing me.\r\nShe was right. I was ungrateful. I didnt care about my life or all they had done to save it. I was a little resentful that they had bothered. When I asked where my missing clothes were, a nurse said theyd cut my shirt off with scissors before defibrillating. As for the shoe, she shrugged and told me Id arrived that way. I walked for the exit in my cold, damp pants, wearing one shoe and no shirt.\r\nI tried to return home, which was upstairs at a Salvation Army, sleeping on the top bunk in a small room with 15 other guys. It was much better than where I had been sleeping: at the Rescue Mission, or under the freeway, or in a hole I dug next to the hull of a rentable catamaran pulled high onto dry sand. I felt safest by the catamaran, although sleeping on the beach in the middle of January was less than ideal, wet dew soaking through my hood, pulled and tied tight, a sopping mummy in a shallow grave. When the staff found out about the ODtipped off when the hospital was calling around trying to find someone to claim methey put me back out on the street for violating the rules. For using drugs. Back to that shallow grave.\r\nI didnt want to die. I simply wasnt ready to stop blotting out memories I spent nearly all my time trying to outmaneuver.\r\nWithin a few days, I was getting high again. I was, though, a tad more careful in the dose department, given my near-death experience. Deep down, I didnt want to die. I simply wasnt ready to stop blotting out those memories I spent nearly all my time trying to outmaneuver. I wasnt ready to face my trauma or what I had done to others in the subsequent yearsI just wanted a break. For many years, getting that break was priority No. 1. I couldnt yet imagine another way.\r\nWhile California recently allocated part of their $1 billion fentanyl bill to future fear campaigns like the one in Fresno, Congress is seeking to continue funding something called the SUPPORT Act, which set up a $20 billion fund to help state and local governments access money to treat those in their communities with opioid use disorder. This is a good thing. Offering treatment is most certainly better than trying to scare people straight. It isnt, however, working. Since they passed the act in 2019, overdose deaths have continued to soar. Meanwhile, America continues to invest resources that dwarf that total in the war on drugs, which just about everyone agrees has been an abject failure of almost unfathomable scope and consequences.\r\nTo the north, there is another view. Vancouvers Downtown Eastside neighborhood, like the rest of North America, has an overdose problem. The scene there can be pretty grimthrongs of people sleeping on sidewalks, or shuffling around, dead on their feet, so to speak. There is no denying that a lifetime of drug use can, indeed, be pretty grim. Even if a person doesnt die from overdose, veins collapse, abscesses emerge, bloodborne pathogens proliferate, and a lack of proper hygiene or nutrition leads to rashes, infections, tooth decay, and emaciation. It has also led, in many cases, to abject poverty, hopelessness, and despair. Its worth acknowledging that this is the far end on a spectrum, and that there are plenty of dependent users living what most consider a normal life, camouflaged among all the other normal lives. Still, this neighborhood in Vancouver isnt hiding the potential consequences of drug dependence.\r\nCanadian law, while certainly not perfect, does allow for a measure of compassion that the United States decidedly does not. Vancouver, along with some other cities in Canada, has institutionally staffed safe injection sites and needle exchange programs, not to mention universal coverage for medical and mental health care, including treatment for substance use disorder. And on the revolutionary fringe of Canadian law is a precarious operation run by compassionate medical professionals, a pilot program that actually prescribes diacetylmorphinemore commonly known as herointo patients who are chronically dependent. Most of these folks have been using for 20 years or more, but now, they travel down to the clinic four times a day to get their fix. (Eligibility requirements vary, but typically only people who are diagnosed with treatment-resistant substance use disorder and are actively using illegal street drugs qualify.) According to a doctor who once ran the program and was interviewed for the documentary Opioid Tragedy, chronic users who participate in the program are no longer required to spend all their time and money procuring drugs by any means necessary. So instead, they do things like reunite with family, get jobs, go back to school, attain housing. One patient, a man who has robbed 60 banks and spent decades in prison, was also interviewed. Im grateful to say that Im now a retired bank robber, he said. He is not alone: other reporting bears out how the program has transformed lives in Canada.\r\nThis may seem hard to fathom. Giving people these drugs? There are certainly critics: Some suggest the safe-supply drugs could end up resold on the streets, while others believe administering them violates a doctors oath to do no harm. (Those same doctors often push people toward opioid substitution therapy, which is the practice of prescribing opioids to treat use disordersin other words, safely supplying opioids.) And the idea remains a third rail in America, where New York City only recently\xa0opened the nations first safe-use clinicin which drug users are supervised, but bring their own drugsand the Biden administration is still in the early stages of\xa0quietly studying the efficacy\xa0of such sites. While policymakers in the United States tinker with the bare minimum, the Vancouver programs are actually addressing the dangers inherent to an unsanctioned drug supply that contains unknowable amounts of fentanyl and its analogs. It has been running for about a decade, during which it has provided a stable of research on the matter. The public health response to a poisoning epidemic must be to provide a safer alternative, as one researcher put it. Unless there is a radical change in our approach to the epidemic, overdose deaths will continue unabated. The results are promising, particularly in avoiding preventable death, and researchers are steadilyconductingstudies that are providing much-needed insight into what has been, historically, an elusive population.\r\nThese developments make me both hopeful and a little weary. Academics do studies; substance use specialists tout treatments. Im not an expert, but I reckon the reason our federal government can spend a collective $60 billion a year on prevention and treatment and still see an astronomical increase in deaths is simple: The prescribed method doesnt work. There are lots of nuanced elements at play here, but at the center is something fairly straightforward: the collective wemeaning the majority of American citizens and nearly all policymakerscannot stomach the idea that we would let people get high on unsanctioned drugs. That concept is beyond whats tolerable. We feel we must save people from themselves.\r\nWhat I want to know is: Why doesnt anyone ask\xa0us?\r\nWhen I saw that dead body on the billboard, casting a long, dark shadow over a suffering community that didnt need its message, a deep sadness washed through me, followed by an all-too-familiar sense of resignation. Its a common scenario: The government folds to pressure, knowing it must do something about a problem, but is more interested in optics than meaningful intervention. I was staring at a billboard that offered a generic message above a terrifying image, with all those official logos poised as endorsements along its bottom border. Advertisements. Like they were supporting something noble. But being noble is not what theyre interested in. Not really. They just know they need to do something. The billboard is, I suppose, a thing. And thats all it is.\r\nThe first day I drove by it, I began researching its origins right when I got home. What I found first were several news stories lauding the effort. What struck me most was the disconnect. No one seemed to know anything meaningful about the problemnot the newscasters, not the City Council officials, not the teens who helped develop the messageaside from the fact that fentanyl causes death. I also found the campaign was not a one-off: Another had been developed by a local woman who lost her son to an overdose. It was crafted using the same kind of frightening imagerythe Grim Reaper, skull and crossbones, etc.only the slogan was ONE PILL CAN KILL. I have no doubt this mother was grieving the loss of her son and wanted nothing more than to save another parent from her pain. I know that at least some of these people have the best intentions. Unfortunately, there exists a cavernous gap, a fundamental chasm, with fear-based and ultimately meaningless signals on one side, and the complicated nature of saving lives in an often maligned and misunderstood community of chronic users on the other.\r\nIt does no good to blame policymakers or journalists or the public for this misunderstandingit is a narrative that has been passed down through generations. What I want to know is: Why doesnt anyone ask us? So much time and money and energy are spent trying to prevent people from using drugs, while almost none is spent trying to mitigate the effects of something that is, quite frankly, not preventable. Americas appetite for drugs has a one-way trajectory: up. Part of the solution can be educationreal education, based on scientific evidence, centering harm reduction rather than abstinencebut that doesnt seem to be of much interest. The collective agreement is that if we can scare the kids, they wont do drugs. With hundreds of thousands of overdoses in recent years, something tells me the kids of my generation werent sufficiently scared into abstinence, nor was the generation that has come of age since. The politics of fear has proven quite effective in elections but pretty useless when it comes between a person and their vices.\r\nAt the time of my overdose, I was actively driving my life off a cliff. In the years following, I got a steady job, sought therapy, and stopped engaging in much of my former high-risk behavior. I wouldnt, however, stop using for a number of years. By then, I was leading what many consider a normal life. It was still full of dysfunction, but I managed to keep my job, my car, my housing, my marriage, my friendsall the things one points to and says, Look. Normal! I was able to stop using thanks in part to medically assisted treatment, and Im very grateful for that. But that was just one piece. It also took a lot of hard work to become healthy again, and I had many luxuries that many with my disorder arent afforded: health care, a supportive network of people, and enough money to get by while I sorted myself out. There are plenty of users who would likely start seeing a profound difference in their lives if they simply stopped having to hustle for dope, if they didnt have to congregate in the liminal spaces where we herd the dispossessed, and if, instead, they obtained their drug of choice legally, from licensed clinicians who care.\r\nThe above idea likely causes many readers to squirm. But if there were a sincere interest in damming the flood of death swallowing up so many lives, it is what we would do. The way things are set up now, a drug user has two choices: get treatment in whatever fashion is mandated or keep using and work their way toward death. Dependent users know a thing or two about the loss of autonomythey live every day at the behest of their habit. Many would stop if they could. And perhaps, if given the chance to do so in their own time, in their own way, they would eventually stop using. But why must that be a requirement? Why must a user do it the way theyre told, or else risk losing access to services? Its just another way to dehumanize drug users, assuming they cant possibly know whats right for them. While its true that many drug users engage in self-destructive behavior, much of that behavior stems from the fact that theyve been relegated to the edges of society. Shamed into isolation. Exiled.\r\n<ol><li>\r\nI Overdosed on Fentanyl. I Barely Survived. A Radical Solution Could Save Thousands Like Me.\r\n </li><li>\r\nI Got a Concussion. I Didnt Get Better.

A dead body. Those are the only two things on that billboard. It isnt a liefentanyl is killing a lot of people. The grave is wide, long, and deep, and growing more cavernous every year. But that billboard is not, in any way, helping. It is, in fact, a callous disregard for human life. The billboard towers over a community in desperate need of aid. It represents millions of dollars spent trying to scare people into abstaining from use altogether rather than implementing policy initiatives that might prevent fentanyl overdoses. With all the money currently being hurled at the problem, creating an emergency order that includes a safe supply for dependent users is an actionable solution. Saving lives might not look the way many envision it. And unfortunately, it seems that without that vision, which always seems to include some version of the sparkling redemption narrative, no one is interested.\r\nAn actor was paid to play a dead woman for a scare campaign while a now-deceased fentanyl user could have been kept alive for one more day for a lot less money. And maybe, after a string of one-more-days, that user would have decided to try something new. That it was time for redemption. Or maybe redemption has nothing to do with it. Redemption is just another day alive.': ""{'PERSON': ['Vivian Peng', 'Jenny', 'Gustavo', 'Donnie', 'Fresno superintendent of schools', 'officers'], 'DATE': ['30 years','past few years'], 'LOC': ['Madrid', 'NY', 'Fresno', 'California', 'America', 'Vancouver', 'United States', 'Canada', 'Downtown Eastside', 'China', 'New York City', 'American'], 'ORG': ['County of Fresno', 'Getty Images Plus', 'Salvation Army', 'Rescue Mission','Congress', 'FDA', 'Downtown Eastside'], 'PROGRAMS': ['billboard ad campaign', 'SUPPORT Act', 'program that prescribes diacetylmorphine', 'safe-use clinic'], 'IMPACT': ['provided a safer alternative', 'transformed lives in Canada', 'reunite with family, get jobs, go back to school, attain housing.']}""}"
"{'Pens, binders, graphing calculator: Check, check, check.\r\nWhat\'s less likely to appear on school supply lists, however, are health-related items for teens and young adults, whether they\'re heading to high school or college.\r\nBut the health landscape has changed drastically over the past three years, and it has become more difficult to know how to prepare. However, experts say, there\'s more information and resources parents can use than ever before.\r\nHere\'s what to know about the tools that are available, where and how to access them, and how to use them.\r\nContraception\r\nLooking ahead to the spring semester, parents can consider the newest addition to over-the-counter contraceptives: a progestin-only birth control pill, called Opill, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration last month.\r\nHRA Pharma, which acquired the pill in 2015, has yet to reveal how much it will cost. And while insurance companies generally cover prescription birth control pills, its unclear if they will cover over-the-counter products when Opill becomes available in early 2024.\r\nWhats also available over the counter:\r\n<ul><li>Condoms\r\n</li><li>Spermicide\r\n</li><li>Contraceptive sponge\r\n</li></ul>Emergency contraception is not technically available over the counter, but most people can access the drug without a prescription depending on the state. Nine states have adopted restrictions on emergency contraceptives, according to the Guttmacher Institute, with some excluding it from their contraceptive coverage mandates and others allowing pharmacists to refuse to dispense the medication.\r\nCommonly known as the morning-after pill, or by its brand name Plan B, the drug is a hormone-based contraceptive that prevents or delays ovulation, which is when an egg is released from the ovary.\r\nGreater access to birth control pills: What else does the arrival of Opill mean?\r\nWhat still requires a prescription:\r\nBesides Opill, all other hormonal birth control pills still require a prescription. Some pills are progestin-only, like Opill, but the most prescribed birth control pills contain both progestin and estrogen.\r\nHormonal contraceptives consist of short-acting and long-acting methods. Short-acting methods are taken on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. Birth control pills are considered short-acting. Long-acting methods can last for years depending on the device.\r\nAccording to Planned Parenthood, other hormonal birth control methods that require a providers prescription include:\r\n<ul><li>Shot; short-acting: Administered every three months and is 94% effective;\r\n</li><li>Patch; short-acting: Replaced weekly and is 91% effective;\r\n</li><li>Ring; short-acting: Taken out once a month and can be 91% effective;\r\n</li><li>Intrauterine device, or IUD; long-acting: A small device thats put into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. It can last between 3 to 5 years, depending on the brand, and is 99% effective;\r\n</li><li>Implant; long-acting: Small, thin rod thats inserted into the arm by a nurse or doctor. It lasts up to five years and is 99% effective.\r\n</li></ul>Fentanyl test strips and naloxone, or Narcan\r\nFentanyl accounted for more than 67,000 preventable deaths in 2021, which represents a 21% increase since 2020, according to the National Safety Council. More than 5,600 of those deaths occurred in people ages 15 to 24.\r\nUsing harm reduction tools like fentanyl test strips and naloxone, the opioid overdose reversal medicine commonly known as Narcan, can help reduce the risk of fentanyl poisoning or accidental overdose, said Dr. Sterling Ransone, board chair and former president of the American Academy of Family Physicians.\r\nIts important to know where to access these tools and how to use them to avoid preventable deaths, said Ransone, who is also a practicing rural family physician in Deltaville, Virginia.\r\nWhat to know about fentanyl test strips:\r\nFentanyl tests strips are small strips of paper that can detect the presence of fentanyl in different kinds of drugs and drug forms, like pills, powders, and injectable substances, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\r\nHow to use fentanyl test strips:\r\n<ul><li>Put a small amount of the drug aside in a clean, dry container.\r\n</li><li>Add water and mix together.\r\n</li><li>Place the wavy end of the test stripe in the mixture and let it absorb for about 15 seconds.\r\n</li><li>Take the test strip out and place on a flat surface for 2 to 5 minutes.\r\n</li><li>Read the results. A single line will appear on the left-hand side of the strip if fentanyl has been detected, indicating a positive result. If there is no fentanyl detected, two pink lines will appear.\r\n</li></ul>While its a useful tool to prevent accidental overdoses, not all fentanyl test strips can be trusted, Ransone said. Some test strips sold online or through friends may be counterfeit or not work properly.\r\n""There are no checks on those folks who can advertise online,"" he said. It\'s important to get fentanyl strips from health departments, community organizations or other trusted sources.\r\nNo prescription required: FDA approves overdose-reversing drug Narcan for over-the-counter sales\r\nWhat to know about naloxone, or Narcan\r\nNaloxone is a medication that can reverse an overdose from opioids including heroin, prescription opioid medications and fentanyl. It can come in a nasal spray or a solution thats injected into the muscle or under the skin, according to the CDC.\r\nNaloxone can be prescribed by a doctor in all 50 states, but some states also have the medication available at local pharmacies without a prescription. Some people also can get naloxone from community-based programs, depending on the state.\r\nBefore administering, the CDC said, its important to call 911 immediately. Try to keep the person awake and breathing, and lay them on their side to prevent choking.\r\nHow to use naloxone nasal spray:\r\n<ul><li>Carefully remove the naloxone from its packaging and hold the nasal spray with your thumb on the plunger.\r\n</li><li>Tilt back the head of the person experiencing an overdose.\r\n</li><li>Place the tip of the nasal spray in either nostril until your fingers are touching their nose.\r\n</li><li>Firmly press the plunger to release the entire dose of medication into their nose.\r\n</li><li>Wait 2-3 minutes for the person to respond. If they dont, give additional doses, switching nostrils, until emergency services arrive.\r\n</li></ul>How to use injectable naloxone: \r\n<ul><li>Take the cap off the vial and stick the needle through the rubber stopper.\r\n</li><li>Draw all the fluid into the needle by pulling back on the plunger.\r\n</li><li>Inject the needle straight into the muscle in the shoulder or into the front of the thigh.\r\n</li><li>Push down on the plunger to empty the syringe.\r\n</li><li>Wait 2-3 minutes for the person to respond. If they dont, give additional doses and stay until emergency services arrive.\r\n</li></ul>COVID-19\r\nCoronavirus transmission has begun to creep up this summer due to travel, less frequent testing and heat waves across the country forcing people to gather inside, leading to a rise in hospitalizations, according to data from the CDC.\r\nTransmission is likely to continue rising in the fall and winter along with other respiratory viruses like influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), experts say, but they\'re not expecting a surge in cases, hospitalizations and deaths like previous years.\r\nMost Americans already have some type of immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, from vaccines or prior infection, and are less likely to develop severe disease. The country is also ready with ample tests at local retailers, and experts say there will likely be a new bivalent booster available in the fall to enhance that immune protection.\r\nThe government is no longer sending free tests since the public health emergency ended in May, but don\'t be too quick to throw away those tests you already received. The FDA has extended the expiration dates of various at-home COVID-19 tests by months and even years. The extended expiration dates by type of test and brand can be found on the agency\'s website.\r\nPeople who get the new bivalent booster will be considered up-to-date on their vaccines, experts say. Americans who didn\'t finish their primary series or get previous boosters will be considered fully vaccinated if they receive the new booster.\r\nMental health\r\nAlthough there\'s no physical toolkit for this, parents can address their kids\' mental health ahead of the school year, said Whitney Raglin Bignall, associate clinical director of On Our Sleeves Movement for Children\'s Mental Health by Nationwide Children\'s Health, a program that offers resources to support children\'s mental health.\r\nThe program provides an online checklist for parents of actions that can improve a child\'s mental health going into the new school year. It includes:\r\n<ul><li>Talking about and practicing any expected changes;\r\n</li><li>Getting back into routine;\r\n</li><li>Getting organized;\r\n</li><li>Talking about expectations for you and your child;\r\n</li><li>Connecting with the school; and\r\n</li><li>Visiting your doctor.\r\n</li></ul>Being prepared, having a routine and knowing what to expect is good for a child\'s mental health, Raglin Bignall said. Getting enough sleep and checking in throughout the year will also help.\r\nParents may want to seek help if they see signs their kids are struggling with their mental health, which may include isolating, not sleeping or sleeping more than usual, having anxiety, avoiding school or complaining of physical symptoms like a stomachache.\r\n""We might want them to see a professional and one of the ways to start doing that is to talk to the school to see if they\'re linked with services or going to see your child pediatrician,"" Raglin Bignall said.\r\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on X, formerly Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT. \r\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

Progression to the UH3 phase is based on an administrative review and is dependent on success in meeting UG3 milestones, NIDCR program priorities, and availability of funds. The NIDCR will be substantially involved with the UG3/UH3 awardees as a partner in providing overall scientific and operational guidance, consistent with the Cooperative Agreement mechanism.\r\nThe UG3/UH3 grant application should include well-developed study development activities and study implementation plans, and it should describe the final design of the UH3 clinical study. Each UG3/UH3 award will support a single UH3 study, and the UG3 planning and UH3 implementation activities must be submitted as a single application.\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nPrescription pain medications, including opioids, are commonly prescribed for the prevention and management of acute post-procedure pain. However, an unfortunate consequence of prescribing opioid medications is the potential for misuse and abuse. In 2016, drug overdose was the leading cause of accidental death in the United States, accounting for 63,632 deaths, including 66.4% that involved an opioid. In addition, recent evidence suggests that short-term opioid exposure in opioid-naïve patients is associated with long-term opioid use. Among persons with no opioid prescriptions in the prior six months who are prescribed at least one day of opioids, the probability of continued opioid use at one year is 6.0%. Further, a prospective study of 12th grade students followed through age 23 suggested that use of prescribed opioids before high school graduation is independently associated with a 33% increase in the risk of future opioid misuse after high school among patients with little drug experience and who disapprove of illegal drug use. Dentists prescribe approximately 6.4 to 8.0% of opioid analgesics dispensed by outpatient US retail pharmacies annually and are the highest percentage prescriber group for patients between 10 and 19 years of age. Most opioid prescriptions written by dentists for adolescents and young adults are believed to be provided to manage acute pain after third molar extraction. These prescriptions may increase the risk for misuse, abuse and diversion of prescription medication in these age groups.\r\nIn addition, data suggest that dental providers’ opioid prescribing patterns for pain management of a dental condition differ by patient socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, sex/gender, and age across the lifespan. Such disparities may be attributed to unconscious biases or cultural differences between dental providers and patients. Further, there is a need to consider alternative approaches to manage acute pain following dental treatment in patients allergic to or unable to take common anlgesics, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), due to medical conditions.\r\nStudies addressing provider decision making in the clinical setting may be necessary to effectively change opioid prescribing practices. Consistent with the American Dental Association’s Interim Board Policy on Opioid Prescribing and the American Dental Education Association’s Policy Brief on The Role of Dental Education in the Prevention of Opioid Prescription Drug Misuse, there is a need to implement clinical decision support systems and other tools to change opioid prescription behaviors towards evidence-based recommendations for acute and chronic oral and craniofacial pain management. This would include educating dental providers to recognize symptoms of substance misuse/abuse, screen for OUDs, and refer at-risk patients to treatment. When substance misuse/abuse is identified, it is important to prepare dental professionals for meaningful interactions with their patients to promote effective referrals to care. Finally, unclear expectations and subconscious bias of dental professionals and patients about the experience and management of post-procedure pain can lead to ineffective or risky pain management approaches. By prescribing opioid medication dosed for five or more days, providers may inadvertently convey expectations of severe pain lasting many days. Conversely, patients instructed to use analgesics for high levels of pain only may experience breakthrough pain. While providers, patients, and other stakeholders likely share a similar goal--safe and effective post-procedure pain management--questions about how best to ensure such care remain unanswered.\r\nRESEARCH OBJECTIVES\r\nIn 2018, NIH launched the Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) Initiative to speed scientific solutions to stem the national opioid public health crisis. Consistent with NIH’s HEAL Initiative, research supported by this concept would address the role of dentistry in overcoming the opioid epidemic. Specifically, this FOA is soliciting applications that: a) Develop and/or test new approaches to manage acute pain following dental treatment, b) implement effective systems to modify dental professional decision-making behaviors towards evidence-based recommendations for acute and chronic oral and craniofacial pain management, or c) promote the dental professional’s role in screening for opioid use disorders (OUDs) and individuals at risk for OUDs.\r\nTo gain more insights about practitioner prescribing practices and patient preferences, studies should consider data collection on providers’ decision-making and prescribing practices to manage post-surgical pain, and independent data collection from patients about their pre-procedure expectations for acute pain management and post-procedure pain experience, analgesic medication intake, and adverse events. User-friendly mobile data collection technologies could be considered to ensure complete reporting of data at multiple timepoints.\r\nSpecific areas of research interest include, but are not limited to:\r\n<ul><li>Determining the need for and\xa0optimal medication course and dosage instructions for analgesicsto manage acute pain following minor surgical procedures, such as tooth extraction, root canal procedures, periodontal surgeries, and implant placement.</li><li>Determining the impact of pre-surgical non-opioid analgesics on the need for postsurgical opioid analgesics.</li><li>Determining the efficacy of non-opioid pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments for management of chronic oral and craniofacial pain conditions, including multidisciplinary approaches.</li><li>Testing or implementing clinical decision support systems and other interventions designed to modify dental providers’ opioid prescribing behaviors towards evidence-based recommendations for acute and chronic pain management.</li><li>Identifying best practices for dental providers’ interactions with patients to encourage appropriate evidence-based pain management strategies.</li><li>Designing, testing, or implementing OUD screening in dental care settings, to permit appropriate referral to treatment.</li><li>Identifying best practices for dental providers’ interactions with patients to promote effective referrals to substance misuse/abuse treatment.</li><li>Optimizing opioid risk mitigation clinical tools, such as those encouraging the use of PDMPs and counseling, prior to prescribing opioids for pain management.</li><li>Exploring the dental provider and patient expectations to better manage the acute post-procedure pain experience.</li><li>Gaining a better understanding of unconscious biases or cultural norms that may contribute to dental providers’ differential pain management prescribing practices by patient sex/gender, age and individuals affected by health disparities (such as racial and ethnic minority populations, less privileged socioeconomic status populations, underserved rural populations, or sexual and gender minorities).</li></ul>SCOPE\r\nApplicants should propose the strongest research design that is appropriate, acceptable and feasible to answer the research questions. Clinical trial designs may be used where appropriate to establish efficacy or effectiveness of strategies for acute and/or chronic orofacial pain management or screening for OUDs. Studies proposing behavioral or social interventions intended to change provider or patient behaviors must include a test of the hypothesized mechanisms of action of the behavioral intervention, as well as a rigorous plan for ensuring intervention fidelity. Applicants may propose other types of clinical studies such as retrospective or prospective observational studies with specific and well-justified hypotheses corresponding to clearly defined and measurable outcomes.\r\nStudies may be supported by a coordinating center, central laboratory and/or other specialized services. Applicants are encouraged to utilize resources (e.g. CTSAs, electronic health records, administrative databases, patient registries, etc.) to increase the efficiency of study operations. If the application proposes a clinical trial with an investigational drug, biologic or device, the investigators must have received approval for the appropriate investigational application to the FDA prior to the UH3 phase.\r\nMonitoring the degree to which a study intervention is delivered as it was intended (i.e., with consistency or fidelity) is expected for clinical trials research. Fidelity monitoring will ensure the intervention is being delivered in a standardized manner across clinical sites and among interventionist personnel. Fidelity monitoring procedures should be described in the grant application or developed during the UG3 planning phase.\r\nDesign, Analysis, and Sample Size for Studies to Evaluate Group-Based Interventions:\r\n Investigators who wish to evaluate the effect of an intervention on a health-related biomedical or behavioral outcome may propose a study in which (1) groups or clusters are assigned to study arms and individual observations are analyzed to evaluate the effect of the intervention, or (2) participants are assigned individually to study arms but receive at least some of their intervention in a real or virtual group or through a shared facilitator. Such studies may propose a parallel group- or cluster-randomized trial, an individually randomized group-treatment trial, a stepped-wedge design, or a quasi-experimental version of one of these designs. In these studies, special methods may be warranted for analysis and sample size estimation. Applicants should show that their methods are appropriate given their plans for assignment of participants and delivery of interventions. Additional information is available at https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov/.\r\nUG3 Clinical Study Planning Phase\r\nThe UG3 planning phase will provide one year of support for operational and scientific planning activities.\r\nOperational planning activities include, at minimum, finalizing the protocol and preparing other documents to implement the clinical study (e.g., data collection instruments, Manual of Procedures, data management plan). Allowable scientific planning activities include small-scale data collection to assess the feasibility and/or acceptability a planned intervention and/or study procedures (e.g., feasibility of proposed data collection procedures; acceptability of mode of intervention delivery; preliminary testing of intervention training and fidelity monitoring procedures) and assessment of the subject population to determine recruitment potential for the future study. The UG3 phase cannot be used to test for intervention safety or efficacy or assess the study’s primary outcome.\r\nActivities supported during the UG3 phase may include, but are not limited to, development of the following:\r\n<ul><li>A final clinical protocol following International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E6 Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance, prepared using the NIDCR observational protocol template (for observational studies), the NIDCR interventional protocol template (for interventional studies), or the NIH-FDA protocol writing tool if proposing a Phase II or Phase III clinical trial that requires an investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE) application;</li><li>The Manual of Procedures (MOP), which should include a detailed description of study procedures to ensure consistency of data collection across sites and processes for validation and quality control of any non-standard clinical or laboratory/mechanistic testing that will be performed;</li><li>The final statistical analysis plan;</li><li>Final data collection instruments (case report forms) that are ready to be programmed into an electronic data management system;</li><li>The consent form(s) and assent form(s), if applicable;</li><li>The Clinical Investigators Brochure (IB) or equivalent, if applicable;</li><li>A plan to administer study agent or deliver the study intervention, train interventionists, and ensure standardized intervention delivery (e.g., intervention fidelity for behavioral interventions), if applicable;</li><li>The final quality management and data management plans;</li><li>A recruitment/enrollment and retention plan for the clinical study, including strategies should enrollment or retention not meet specified metrics; and</li><li>For applications testing one or more behavioral intervention(s), plans for testing whether the intervention engaged the hypothesized target(s), in addition to efficacy or effectiveness outcomes.</li></ul>Milestones and UG3/UH3 Transition\r\nAll projects must be driven by well-defined, measurable milestones for the UG3 planning phase and annual milestones for the UH3 study implementation phase. A milestone is defined as a scheduled event in the project timeline, signifying the completion of a major project stage or activity. All UG3 grants will need to meet milestones to have an opportunity to move to the UH3 implementation phase. Toward the completion of the UG3 planning phase, the applicant will be required to submit a detailed transition request package, which will undergo an administrative review to determine whether the study will be awarded funding for the UH3 clinical trial implementation phase.\r\nProspective applicants should note that initial funding of the UG3/UH3 cooperative agreement does not guarantee funding of the UH3 phase. Transition to the UH3 phase is dependent on having successfully met the UG3 planning milestones, NIDCR program priorities, and availability of funds.\r\nUH3 Clinical Study Implementation Phase\r\nThe UH3 funding period will provide up to five years of support to conduct the observational study or clinical trial in accordance with activities planned in the UG3 phase. Continued funding during the UH3 phase will be dependent upon meeting annual UH3 milestones, and it is expected that the study will be completed within the UH3 grant period. The study outcome measure(s) must be clinically meaningful and important to stakeholders including patients and health care providers. The NIDCR expects studies supported during the UH3 phase to be hypothesis driven, with well-defined milestones. UH3 activities may include the following operational activities, expressed as UH3 milestones:\r\n<ul><li>Finalization of data management system(s)</li><li>Completion of regulatory approvals</li><li>Study activation</li><li>Registration of clinical trial in ClinicalTrials.gov (for clinical trials)</li><li>Enrollment of the first study participant</li><li>Enrollment and randomization, if applicable, of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the projected study population</li><li>Completion of data collection</li><li>Completion of primary outcome data analyses</li><li>Reporting of results in ClinicalTrials.gov (for clinical trials)</li></ul>Additional Information\r\nThe proposed clinical study must meet all applicable NIH and Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) policy requirements, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements should be followed where applicable.

The renewal process may require as much time as the initial registration. SAM registration includes the assignment of a Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) Code for domestic organizations which have not already been assigned a CAGE Code.\r\n<ul><li>NATO Commercial and Government Entity (NCAGE) Code – Foreign organizations must obtain an NCAGE code (in lieu of a CAGE code) in order to register in SAM.</li><li>Unique Entity Identifier (UEI)- A UEI is issued as part of the SAM.gov registration process. SAM registrations prior to fall 2021 were updated to include a UEI. For applications due on or after January 25, 2022, the UEI must be provided on the application forms (e.g., FORMS-G); the same UEI must be used for all registrations, as well as on the grant application.</li><li>Dun and Bradstreet Universal Numbering System (DUNS) – Organization registrations prior to April 2022 require applicants to obtain a DUNS prior to registering in SAM. By April 2022, the federal government will stop using the DUNS number as an entity identifier and will transition to the Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) issued by SAM. Prior to April 2022, after obtaining a DUNS number, applicants can begin both SAM and eRA Commons registrations. The same DUNS number must be used for all registrations, as well as on the grant application.</li></ul></li><li>eRA Commons - Once the unique organization identifier (DUNS prior to April 2022; UEI after April 2022) is established, organizations can register with eRA Commons in tandem with completing their full SAM and Grants.gov registrations; all registrations must be in place by time of submission. eRA Commons requires organizations to identify at least one Signing Official (SO) and at least one Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) account in order to submit an application.</li><li>Grants.gov – Applicants must have an active SAM registration in order to complete the Grants.gov registration.</li></ul>Program Directors/Principal Investigators (PD(s)/PI(s))\r\nAll PD(s)/PI(s) must have an eRA Commons account. \xa0PD(s)/PI(s) should work with their organizational officials to either create a new account or to affiliate their existing account with the applicant organization in eRA Commons. If the PD/PI is also the organizational Signing Official, they must have two distinct eRA Commons accounts, one for each role. Obtaining an eRA Commons account can take up to 2 weeks.\r\nAny individual(s) with the skills, knowledge, and resources necessary to carry out the proposed research as the Program Director(s)/Principal Investigator(s) (PD(s)/PI(s)) is invited to work with his/her organization to develop an application for support.

Award Notices\r\nIf the application is under consideration for funding, NIH will request ""just-in-time"" information from the applicant as described in the\xa0NIH Grants Policy Statement.\r\nA formal notification in the form of a Notice of Award (NoA) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. The NoA signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the recipient\'s business official.\r\nRecipients must comply with any funding restrictions described in Section IV.5. Funding Restrictions. Selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. Any costs incurred before receipt of the NoA are at the recipient\'s risk. These costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs.\r\nAny application awarded in response to this FOA will be subject to terms and conditions found on the Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants website.\xa0 This includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website.\r\nIndividual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the NIH and are subject to the IC-specific terms and conditions identified in the NoA.\r\nClinicalTrials.gov: If an award provides for one or more clinical trials. By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the ""responsible party"" must register and submit results information for certain “applicable clinical trials” on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website (https://register.clinicaltrials.gov). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm\r\nInstitutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.\r\nData and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&amp;R) and PHS 398).\r\nInvestigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE).\r\n2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements\r\nAll NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the NIH Grants Policy Statement as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General\xa0and Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Recipients, and Activities, including of note, but not limited to:\r\nIf a recipient is successful and receives a Notice of Award, in accepting the award, the recipient agrees that any activities under the award are subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other Department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions.\r\nShould the applicant organization successfully compete for an award, recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex (including gender identify, sexual orientation, and pregnancy). This includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited English proficiency and persons with disabilities. The HHS Office for Civil Rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. Please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.html\r\nHHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this FOA.\r\nPlease contact the HHS Office for Civil Rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html or call 1-800-368-1019 or TDD 1-800-537-7697.\r\nIn accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) requirements. FAPIIS requires Federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS) prior to making an award. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a Federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 CFR Part 75.205 and 2 CFR Part 200.206 “Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.\r\nThe following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) administrative guidelines, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) grant administration regulations at 45 CFR Part 75, 2 CFR Part 200, and other HHS, PHS, and NIH grant administration policies.\r\nThe administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an ""assistance"" mechanism (rather than an ""acquisition"" mechanism), in which substantial NIH programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. Under the cooperative agreement, the NIH purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients\' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. Consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the recipients for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipients and the NIH as defined below.\r\nThe PD(s)/PI(s) will have primary responsibility for:\r\n<ul><li>Providing scientific leadership for all aspects of the study, including planning, any modification of study design, conduct of the study, quality control, data analysis and interpretation, preparation of publications, dissemination of data, tools, and technologies, and collaboration with other investigators. The PD(s)/PI(s) agrees to accept close coordination, cooperation, and participation of NIDCR staff in those aspects of scientific and technical management of the study as stated in these terms and conditions;</li><li>Adhering to the NIDCR Clinical Terms of Award requiring that studies be monitored commensurate with the degree of potential risk to study subjects and the complexity of the study;</li><li>Upon implementation of the study, following the procedures required by the protocol regarding study conduct and monitoring, participant management, data collection, and quality control;</li><li>Retaining custody of and having primary rights to the data developed under these awards, subject to Government rights of access consistent with current HHS, PHS, and NIH policies;</li><li>Managing involvement of industry or any other third party in the study. Except for licensing of patents or copyrights, support or involvement of any third party will occur only following notification of and concurrence by the NIDCR;</li><li>Managing procedures to comply with the requirements of 45 CFR Part 46 for the protection of human subjects and the NIH policy requirements for the inclusion of women, minorities, and children and, where applicable, for all participating institutions to comply with FDA regulations for studies involving investigational products.</li><li>Making all study materials, procedure manuals, and final datasets available in the public domain, managed by the recipient institution. Recipients are expected to publish and publicly disseminate results, data, and other products of the study, concordant with NIH governance policies and protocols. Publications and oral presentations of work performed under this agreement will require appropriate acknowledgment of support by the NIH/NIDCR;</li><li>Obtaining prior written approval of the NIDCR Grants Management Specialist, in consultation with the NIDCR Program Officer, for changes in any of the key personnel identified in the Notice of Grant Award.</li></ul>NIH staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below.\r\nAn NIDCR Project Scientist will be assigned. The NIDCR Project Scientist will:\r\n<ul><li>Consult with the PD(s)/PI(s) regarding UG3 milestones for the planning phase of the study and annual milestones for the UH3 implementation phase;</li><li>Serve as a resource to provide scientific/programmatic support during research study planning and implementation by providing input on experimental and clinical approaches and study protocols, and advising in the management and operational aspects of study development and implementation;</li><li>Participate on teleconferences with PDs/PIs to monitor study development and implementation progress, adherence to the study protocol, conduct of the study, and recruitment and retention of study participants;</li><li>Review the progress of the study through consideration of routine reporting, site visits, oversight committee recommendations, etc. This review may include, but would not be limited to, compliance with the study protocol, meeting participant enrollment targets, adherence to uniform data collection procedures, and the timeliness and quality of data reporting;</li><li>Periodically review reports of study progress. NIDCR staff may use information obtained from the data for the preparation of internal reports on the activities of the study. However, recipients will retain custody of and have primary rights to all data developed under these awards, subject to Government right of access consistent with HHS, PHS and NIH policies.</li></ul>An NIDCR Program Official will be assigned. The NIDCR Program Official will:\r\n<ul><li>Carry out continuous review of all activities to ensure that the objectives are being met and that all regulatory, fiscal, and administrative matters are handled according to NIH guidelines;</li><li>Have the option to withhold support to a participating institution if technical performance requirements are not met;</li><li>Perform other duties required for normal program stewardship of grants.</li></ul>An NIDCR Medical Officer will monitor the studies and serve as the Medical Monitor.\r\nThe NIDCR reserves the right to terminate or curtail a study or any portion of a study in the event of (a) failure to implement the study protocol, (b) a substantial shortfall in participant recruitment and retention, data reporting and dissemination, quality control or other major breach of the protocol, (c) substantive changes in the agreed-upon protocol with which the NIDCR does not concur, (d) reaching a major study objective substantially before schedule with persuasive statistical evidence, or human subject ethical issues that may dictate a premature termination.\r\nAreas of Joint Responsibility include:\r\nNone, all responsibilities are divided between recipients and NIH staff as described above.\r\nDispute Resolution:\r\nWith the exception of the decision about transitioning to the UH3 phase, any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between recipients and the NIH may be brought to Dispute Resolution. A Dispute Resolution Panel composed of three members will be convened. Members will be: a designee chosen by the PD/PI, one NIH designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual recipient. This special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the recipient\'s right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with PHS regulation 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart D and DHHS regulation 45 CFR Part 16.\r\nA final RPPR, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the Federal Financial Report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the NIH Grants Policy Statement. NIH FOAs outline intended research goals and objectives. Post award, NIH will review and measure performance based on the details and outcomes that are shared within the RPPR, as described at 45 CFR Part 75.301 and 2 CFR Part 200.301.\r\nThe Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Transparency Act), includes a requirement for recipients of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later.\xa0 All recipients of applicable NIH grants and cooperative agreements\xa0are required to report to the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) available at www.fsrs.gov on all subawards over $25,000.\xa0 See the NIH Grants Policy Statement for additional information on this reporting requirement.\r\nIn accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 CFR 75.113 and Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75, recipients that have currently active Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a Federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the System for Award Management (SAM)\xa0about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a Federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period.\xa0 The recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings.\xa0Proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS).\xa0 This is a statutory requirement under section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313).\xa0 As required by section 3010 of Public Law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for Federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available.\xa0 Full reporting requirements and procedures are found in Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75 – Award Term and Conditions for Recipient Integrity and Performance Matters.\r\nWe encourage inquiries concerning this funding opportunity and welcome the opportunity to answer questions from potential applicants.\r\neRA Service Desk (Questions regarding ASSIST, eRA Commons, application errors and warnings, documenting system problems that threaten\xa0submission by the due date, and post-submission issues)\r\nFinding Help Online:\xa0http://grants.nih.gov/support/\xa0(preferred method of contact)Telephone: 301-402-7469 or 866-504-9552 (Toll Free)\r\nGeneral Grants Information (Questions regarding application instructions, application processes, and NIH grant resources)Email:\xa0GrantsInfo@nih.gov\xa0(preferred method of contact)Telephone: 301-945-7573\r\nGrants.gov Customer Support\xa0(Questions regarding Grants.gov registration and Workspace)Contact Center Telephone: 800-518-4726Email:\xa0support@grants.gov\r\nDena Fischer, DDS, MSD, MSNational Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)Telephone: 301-594-4876Email:\xa0dena.fischer@nih.gov\r\nFor behavioral and social science research including behavioral and social\xa0interventions, contact:\r\nMelissa W.

"{'The marketing pitches are bold and arriving fast: Invest opioid settlement dollars in a lasso-like device to help police detain people without Tasers or pepper spray. Pour money into psychedelics, electrical stimulation devices, and other experimental treatments for addiction. Fund research into new, supposedly abuse-deterrent opioids and splurge on expensive, brand-name naloxone.These pitches land daily in the inboxes of state and local officials in charge of distributing more than $50 billion from settlements in opioid lawsuits.\r\nThe money is coming from an array of companies that made, sold, or distributed prescription painkillers, including Johnson &amp; Johnson, AmerisourceBergen, and Walgreens. Thousands of state and local governments sued the companies for aggressively promoting and distributing opioid medications, fueling an epidemic that progressed to heroin and fentanyl and has killed more than half a million Americans. The settlement money, arriving over nearly two decades, is meant to remediate the effects of that corporate behavior.\r\nBut as the dollars land in government coffers more than $4.3 billion as of early November a swarm of private, public, nonprofit, and for-profit entities are eyeing the gold rush. Some people fear that corporations, in particular with their flashy products, robust marketing budgets, and hunger for profits will now gobble up the windfall meant to rectify it.\r\nThey see a cash cow, said JK Costello, director of behavioral health consulting for the Steadman Group, a firm that is being paid to help local governments administer the settlements in Colorado, Kansas, Oregon, and Virginia. Everyone is interested.\r\nCostello receives multiple emails a week from businesses and nonprofits seeking guidance on how to apply for the funds. To keep up with the influx, he has developed a standard response: Thanks, but we cant respond to individual requests, so heres a link to your localitys website, public meeting schedule, or application portal.\r\nKFF Health News obtained email records in eight states that show health departments, sheriffs offices, and councils overseeing settlement funds are receiving a similar deluge of messages. In the emails, marketing specialists offer phone calls, informational presentations, and meetings with their companies.\r\nAlabama Attorney General Steve Marshall recently sent a letter reminding local officials to vet organizations that reach out. I am sure that many of you have already been approached by a variety of vendors seeking funding for opioid initiatives, he wrote. Please proceed with caution.\r\nOf course, not all marketing efforts should prompt concern. Emails and calls are one way people in power learn about innovative products and services. The countrys addiction crisis is too large for the public sector to tame alone, and many stakeholders agree that partnering with industry is crucial. After all, pharmaceutical companies manufacture medications to treat opioid addiction. Corporations run treatment facilities and telehealth services.\r\nIts unrealistic and even harmful to say we dont want any money going to any private companies, said Kristen Pendergrass, vice president of state policy at Shatterproof, a national nonprofit focused on addiction.\r\nThe key, agree public health and policy experts, is to critically evaluate products or services to see if they are necessary, evidence-based, and sustainable instead of flocking to companies with the best marketing.\r\nOtherwise, you end up with lots of shiny objects, Costello said.\r\nAnd, ultimately, failure to do due diligence could leave some jurisdictions holding an empty bag.\r\nTake North Carolina. In 2022, state lawmakers allotted $1.85 million of settlement funds for a pilot project using the first FDA-approved app for opioid use disorder, developed by Pear Therapeutics. There were high hopes the app would help people stay in treatment longer.\r\nBut less than a year later, Pear Therapeutics filed for bankruptcy.\r\nThe state hadnt paid the company yet, so the money isnt lost, according to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. But the department and lawmakers have not decided what to do with those dollars next.\r\nJason Sundby, CEO of Verde Environmental Technologies, said the Deterra pouches his company sells are a low-cost way to prevent expensive addictions.\r\nCustomers place their unused medications in a Deterra pouch and add water, deactivating the drugs before tossing them, ensuring they cannot be used even if fished out of the trash. A medium Deterra pouch costs $3.89 and holds 45 pills.\r\nThe goal is to get these drugs out of peoples homes before they can be misused, diverted, and people start down the path of needing treatment or naloxone or emergency room visits, Sundby said.\r\nSundbys company ran an ad about spending settlement dollars on its product in a National Association of Counties newsletter and featured similar information online.\r\nIt may be paying off, as Deterra is set to receive $1 million in settlement funds from the health department in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, and $12,000 from the sheriffs office in Henry County, Iowa. The company also has partnerships with St. Croix and Milwaukee counties in Wisconsin, and is working on a deal in Connecticut.\r\nSeveral other companies with similar products have also used their product sites to urge jurisdictions to consider the settlements as a funding stream and theyre seeing early success.\r\nDisposeRx makes a drug deactivation product its version costs about a dollar each and received $144,000 in South Carolina for mailing 134,000 disposal packets to a program that educated high school football players, coaches, and parents about addiction.\r\nSafeRx makes $3 pill bottles with a locking code to store medications and was awarded $189,000 by South Carolinas opioid settlement council to work with the Greenville County Sheriffs Office and local prevention groups. It also won smaller awards from Weld and Custer counties in Colorado.\r\nNone of the companies said they are dependent on opioid settlements to sustain their business long-term. But the funds provide a temporary boost. In a 2022 presentation to prospective investors, SafeRx called the opioid settlements a growth catalyst.\r\nCritics of such investments say the products are not worthwhile. Todays crisis of fatal overdoses is largely driven by illicit fentanyl. Even if studiessuggest the companies products make people more likely to safely store and dispose of medications, thats unlikely to stem the record levels of deaths seen in recent years.\r\nThe plausible mechanism by which they would even be able to reduce overdose is a mystery because prescription medications are not driving overdose, said Tricia Christensen, policy director with the nonprofit Community Education Group, which is tracking settlement spending across Appalachia.\r\nSafe storage and disposal can be accomplished with a locking cabinet and toilet, she said. The FDA lists opioids on its flush list for disposal and says there is no evidence that low levels of the medicines that end up in rivers harm human health.\r\nBut Milton Cohen, CEO of SafeRxs parent company, Caring Closures International, said keeping prescription medicines secure addresses the root of the epidemic. Fentanyl kills, but often where people start, where water is coming into the boat still, is the medicine cabinet, he said. We can bail all we want, but the right thing to do is to plug the hole first.\r\nProducts to secure and dispose of drugs also provide an opportunity for education and destigmatization, said Melissa Lyon, director of the Delaware County Health Department in Pennsylvania. The county will be mailing Deterra pouches and postcards about preventing addiction to three-quarters of its residents.\r\nThe Deterra pouch is to me a direct correlation to the overprescribing that came from pharmaceutical companies aggressive marketing, she added. Since the settlement money is to compensate for that, this is a good use of the funds.\r\nOther businesses making pitches for settlement funds have a less clear relationship to opioids.\r\nWrap Technologies creates tools for law enforcement to reduce lethal uses of force. Its chief product, the BolaWrap, shoots a 7½-foot Kevlar tether more than a dozen feet through the air until it wraps around a persons limbs or torso almost like Wonder Womans Lasso of Truth.\r\nTerry Nichols, director of business development for the company, said the BolaWrap can be used as an alternative to Tasers or pepper spray when officers need to detain someone experiencing a mental health crisis or committing crimes related to their addiction, like burglary.\r\nIf you want to be more humane in the way you treat people in substance use disorder and crisis, this is an option, he said.\r\nThe company posts body camera footage of officers using BolaWrap on YouTube and says that out of 192 field reports of its use, about 75% of situations were resolved without additional use of force.\r\nWhen officers de-escalate situations, people are less likely to end up in jail, Nichols said. And diverting people from the criminal justice system is among the suggested investments in opioid settlement agreements.\r\nThat argument convinced the city of Brownwood, Texas, where Nichols was police chief until 2019. It has spent about $15,000 of opioid settlement funds to buy nine BolaWrap devices.\r\nOur goal is to avoid using force when a citizen is in need, said James Fuller, assistant police chief in Brownwood. If were going to take someone to get help, the last thing we want to do is poke holes in them with a Taser.\r\nAfter Brownwoods purchase, Wrap Technologies issued a press release in which CEO Kevin Mullins encouraged more law enforcement agencies to take the opportunity afforded by the opioid settlement funds to empower their officers. The company has also sent a two-page document to police departments explaining how settlement funds can be used to buy BolaWraps.\r\nLanguage from that document appeared nearly word-for-word in a briefing sheet given to Brownwood City Council before the BolaWrap purchase. The council voted unanimously in favor.\r\nBut the process hasnt been as smooth elsewhere. In Hawthorne, California, the police department planned to buy 80 BolaWrap devices using opioid settlement funds. It paid its first installment of about $25,000 in June. However, it was later informed by the state Department of Health Care Services that the BolaWrap is not an allowable use of these dollars.\r\nBola Wraps will not be purchased with the Settlement Funds in the future, Hawthorne City Clerk Dayna Williams-Hunter wrote in an email.\r\nCarolyn Williams, a member of the advocacy group Vocal-TX, said she doesnt see how the devices will address the overdose crisis in Texas or elsewhere.\r\nHer son Haison Akiem Williams dealt with mental health and addiction issues for years. Without insurance, he couldnt afford rehab. When he sought case management services, there was a three-month wait, she said. Police charged him with misdemeanors but never connected him to care, she said.\r\nIn February, he died of an overdose at age 47. His mother misses how he used to make her laugh by calling her Ms. Carol.\r\nShe wants settlement funds to support services she thinks could have kept him alive: mental health treatment, case management, and housing. BolaWrap doesnt make that list.\r\nIts heartbreaking to see what the government is doing with this money, she said. Putting it in places they really dont need it.\r\nKFF Health News, formerly known as Kaiser Health News (KHN), is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.': ""{{'PERSON': ['JK Costello', 'Kristen Pendergrass', 'Jason Sundby', 'Tricia Christensen', 'Milton Cohen', 'Melissa Lyon', 'Terry Nichols', 'James Fuller', 'Kevin Mullins', 'Dayna Williams-Hunter', 'Carolyn Williams', 'Haison Akiem Williams'], 'DATE': ['early November', '2022', 'June', 'February'], 'LOC': ['Colorado', 'Kansas', 'Oregon', 'Virginia', 'Alabama', 'North Carolina', 'Delaware County', 'Pennsylvania', 'Henry County', 'Iowa', 'St. Croix', 'Milwaukee', 'Wisconsin', 'Connecticut', 'South Carolina', 'Greenville County', 'Weld', 'Custer', 'Colorado', 'Appalachia', 'Brownwood', 'Texas', 'Hawthorne', 'California'], 'ORG': ['Steadman Group', 'KFF Health News', 'Johnson &amp; Johnson', 'AmerisourceBergen', 'Walgreens', 'North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services', 'Verde Environmental Technologies', 'National Association of Counties', 'DisposeRx', 'SafeRx', 'Caring Closures International', 'Community Education Group', 'Delaware County Health Department', 'Wrap Technologies', 'Brownwood City Council', 'Vocal-TX'], 'PROGRAMS': ['opioid settlement dollars', 'lasso-like device', 'psychodelics', 'electrical stimulation devices', 'experimental treatments', 'abuse-deterrent opioids', 'naloxone', 'FDA-approved app for opioid use disorder', 'Deterra pouches', 'SafeRx pill bottles', 'BolaWrap', 'Tasers'], 'IMPACT': ['remediate the effects of corporate behavior', 'help people stay in treatment longer', 'prevent expensive addictions', 'educate and destigmatize addiction', 'reduce lethal uses of force', 'divert people from criminal justice system', 'provide mental health treatment', 'give case management', 'provide housing']}}""}"
"{'The opioid crisis, which began in the 1990s, is worse than ever. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for the 12 months ending in April 2021, there were over 100,000 overdose deaths, an increase of 28.5 percent over 2020 levels.\xa0\r\nOften lost in the understandable concern about these fatalities are millions of chronic pain patients who are unable to get adequate pain relief.\r\nIn 2012, American physicians wrote the staggering number of 255 million prescriptions for opioid pain relievers. To reduce deaths and other harms, the CDC and other federal and state policymakers focused on significantly decreasing opioid prescribing and usage. By 2020, there were only 142 million opioid prescriptions, although in some parts of the country there are still exceedingly high levels of opioids being prescribed.\xa0\r\nThe reduction in opioid prescriptions, however, did not reduce overdose deaths. In fact, from 2012 to 2021, overdose deaths soared from 41,000 to 100,000, with most deaths now resulting from illegal synthetic opioids fentanyl and its analogs. Fighting the war on opioids at every physicians office was a terrible mistake, and an unintended consequence has been to increase the suffering of many patients with chronic diseases whose long-term pain management depends on access to opioids. How did we get to this point?\xa0\xa0\r\nMost of the millions of opioid pills taken by patients for pain each year are prescribed by physicians without specialized training in pain management. A study published in 2013, near the height of opioid prescribing, estimated that 20 percent of patients treated in doctors offices for pain received an opioid prescription. To address this dangerous overprescribing of opioids, in 2016 the CDC published its Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain. It provides recommendations for the prescribing of pain medication by primary care clinicians for chronic pain . . . in outpatient settings outside of active cancer treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care.\xa0\xa0\r\nSome recommendations in the guideline are especially troublesome. First is the recommendation that Nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid therapy are preferred for chronic pain. In following this recommendation, some doctors have prescribed ineffective over-the-counter pain medicines or talk therapy instead of opioids for patients who have serious injuries and illnesses confirmed by imaging and lab tests, and who have previously tried these measures without benefit. A recent review of the evidence found there is no scientific basis to conclude that non-drug treatments are an adequate substitute for opioids in controlling severe pain.\xa0\r\nThe CDC guideline is also being applied beyond its intended outpatient, primary care settings. Many hospitals and other large health care providers incorrectly believe that any violations of the guideline will lead to civil or even criminal liability, so they drastically restrict opioid prescribing by their physicians. Fear of losing their medical license, staff privileges, or employment, rather than sound medicine, now drives many physicians treating pain. Also, over 30 states have followed the CDC guideline by enacting laws limiting prescribing opioids, further deterring physicians from prescribing opioids, even for responsible patients in great distress.\r\nIn 2019, the CDC admitted that its guideline was being misused, but it failed to take any action. In 2020, the American Medical Association (AMA) recommended that physicians immediately suspend the use of the CDC guideline to limit, discontinue, or taper a patients opioids.The AMA stated: It is clear that the CDC guideline has harmed many patients.\xa0\xa0\xa0\r\nBased on another guideline recommendation, many physicians are aggressively reducing or tapering long-term patients with chronic pain, sometimes at a dangerously fast rate. The main reasons doctors give for tapering are opioid guidelines, policies, and concerns about liability.In 2019, the Food and Drug Administration took the unusual step of warning doctors that sudden discontinuation of opioid pain medication should be avoided.\r\nA recent study of more than 100,000 patients receiving opioids long-term for pain sought to determine the effects of tapering. The results were shocking. The authors found a 68 percent increase in overdoses and a doubling of mental health crises in tapered versus non-tapered patients. Tapering also causes desperate patients unable to get pain control from their physician to self-medicate by obtaining heroin or illicit fentanyl, often with tragic results.\xa0\r\nAnother heartbreaking outcome of improper tapering is suicide. Although the CDC overdose death data include suicides, it is likely that suicides are undercounted. One study found that up to 30 percent of all accidental overdoses are suicides. In 2020, there were over 45,000 deaths listed as suicides in the United States. Adding a significant percentage of the 100,000 overdose deaths would generate an extraordinarily high number clearly indicating that many people in our country are suffering. And these numbers dont include the millions of individuals whose poorly controlled pain causes extreme anxiety, depression and decreased quality of life.\r\nThe CDC guideline was never supposed to apply to cancer or end-of-life care. Sadly, even patients with a terminal prognosis and uncontrolled pain have not been spared the cruelty of the opioid crackdown. A recent study of older patients dying of cancer found a substantial reduction in the number and strength of opioid prescriptions, especially those for long-acting opioids. One consequence was a 50 percent increase in pain-related emergency department visits.\xa0\xa0\r\nOverzealous policies to limit opioids have significantly hampered pain control for 18 million patients with moderate to severe chronic pain. Besides the CDC guideline, Drug Enforcement Administration criminal investigations, state prescription drug monitoring programs, Medicare reimbursement policies, pharmacy and insurance limits on prescriptions, and policies of hospitals and physician groups have directly or indirectly reduced access to opioids by law-abiding patients. All these policies should be reevaluated and modified or discontinued as necessary.\xa0\xa0\r\nThe CDC is expected to release a revised guideline on opioid prescribing sometime in 2022, but suffering patients cannot wait until the CDC issues a new guideline for physicians. The CDC should immediately rescind its 2016 guideline, thereby reaffirming the first principle of medical ethics: First, do no harm.\r\nMark A. Rothstein is the Herbert F.

Applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the Application Guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in Section IV. When the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the Application Guide, follow the program-specific instructions.\r\nApplications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.\r\nBackground\r\nPrenatal alcohol exposure is a leading preventable cause of birth defects and neurodevelopmental deficits in the United States. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) can occur in individuals who were prenatally exposed to alcohol. Alcohol can disrupt prenatal development at any stage during pregnancy, including the earliest stages, often before a woman knows that she is pregnant. A 2018 study estimated that 1 to 5 percent children in the first grade in the US have FASD, the majority of whom were previously undiagnosed.\r\nFASD is an umbrella term for a range of physical, cognitive, and behavioral abnormalities caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. FASD may include any disorder within the FASD spectrum, e.g., fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS (pFAS), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD), and neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE).\r\nAs prenatal alcohol exposure leads to heterogeneous clinical and non-clinical symptoms, individuals with FASD tend to have their own unique combination of day-to-day challenges, which may include medical, behavioral, psychological, educational, and social problems. People with FASD may have difficulty in areas of neurocognition (including global intellectual impairment, executive function deficits, poor working memory, learning problems);\xa0self-regulation (impulse control problems, impaired mood or behavioral regulation, attention deficits, organization difficulties); and adaptive functioning (communication issues, problems with daily living, poor social skills, gross or fine motor delay).\xa0Individuals are affected differently, with some having minor impairments in a single domain, whereas others have multiple difficulties and a lifelong developmental disability.\xa0\r\nThrough this initiative, NIAAA is interested in developing evidence-based prevention strategies to reduce the incidence of FASD and interventions/treatments to lessen the deficits in individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. Reports from prenatal clinics and postnatal studies suggest that as many as 20-30 percent of women drink at some time during pregnancy. Several risk factors have been identified that place offspring at higher risk for FASD, including level of alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy, later initiation of prenatal care, family history of heavy drinking and other factors.\r\nOver the past decade, NIAAA supported the development of various treatment approaches using dietary supplements, sensorimotor training, behavioral interventions, and parenting strategies to improve outcomes in individuals with FASD.\xa0Similarly, NIAAA has funded research into screening, brief interventions, and treatment approaches for high-risk and vulnerable populations, including pregnant women. Despite these investments, challenges remain, with a critical need to build the evidence base for interventions to improve outcomes in individuals with FASD, and for prevention strategies, including primary, secondary, and tertiary approaches, to decrease alcohol use during pregnancy and the incidence of FASD.\xa0\r\nResearch Scope\r\nThis NOFO encourages new studies that propose new strategies for prevention of FASD or intervention for individuals affected by FASD throughout the lifespan, through an R34 planning grant mechanism.\xa0It is expected that research conducted via this mechanism will provide pilot and/or feasibility data for prevention or intervention approaches that are a pre-requisite for preparing and submitting subsequent applications for larger scale projects (i.e., an R01).\r\nThis NOFO is intended for research that aims to pilot and/or feasibility test: (1) novel prevention or intervention strategies based on and informed by translation of basic science findings; (2) theory-based preventions or interventions that need additional evaluation; (3) novel approaches to enhance effectiveness or reach and/or improve scalability of prevention or treatment interventions in community settings; (4) strategies to improve evaluation and/or broad implementation of effective interventions in clinical and other community settings; or (5) strategies to prepare, optimize, or evaluate multicomponent interventions.\r\nApplications to this NOFO are not required to present pilot data in support of the proposed approaches, hypotheses and aims. However, preliminary data may be included. A well-defined theory of change (or logic model) and associated hypotheses are expected. Applicants are encouraged to provide strong evidence of their ability to conduct the proposed study, through documenting the availability of needed resources, evidence of institutional support, the training and experience of the investigator team, and/or the conduct of related studies.\r\nSeveral types of applications are encouraged by this R34 NOFO, including applications addressing pilot and feasibility testing for innovative, scalable prevention and treatment interventions, mixed methods approaches to the development of multi-modal (e.g., behavioral, pharmacological, and/or structural), interventions, modeling approaches that examine hypotheses relevant to scale-up activities, and the development of improved measures relevant to large-scale implementation.\r\n\xa0Study topics include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n<ul><li>Design and evaluate novel policy, community-based, and health messaging and other behavioral and social science approaches to help women reduce or abstain from drinking during pregnancy</li><li>Advance strategies to reduce stigmatization of women who use(d) alcohol, biological mothers of children with FASD, and individuals with FASD</li><li>Improve current prevention strategies to reduce use of alcohol in women of childbearing age</li><li>Identify and mitigate risk factors in populations with high incidence rates of FASD</li><li>Design and evaluate cost-effective, culturally sensitive interventions aimed at preventing FASD in high risk, vulnerable, and diverse populations</li><li>Understand the effects of policies regarding alcohol consumption on maternal health and infant outcomes</li><li>Develop and evaluate prenatal and postnatal therapeutic approaches, medications, and/or dietary components to mitigate the physical, neurocognitive and behavioral deficits associated with FASD across the lifespan</li><li>Advance approaches for parenting/caregiver skills development to improve care for children with FASD</li><li>Develop school-based methods focused on specialized teaching strategies and approaches, including implementation strategies</li><li>Develop and evaluate innovative approaches to improve health and quality of life for individuals with FASD and their families</li><li>Evaluate and implement interventions previously shown to be effective in populations with developmental disabilities for use in individuals with FASD</li><li>Evaluate models for improving identification and access to care for individuals with FASD, such as integration into developmental disability health care services and networks, utilization of telemedicine, or novel technologies.\xa0</li></ul>Notes on priorities\r\nThe main goal of this opportunity is to support research on prevention and intervention strategies to reduce prenatal alcohol exposure and its effects. Applications relating to prenatal exposure to multiple substances (nicotine, cannabis, opioids, methamphetamine, and/or prescription drugs) will be considered responsive; however, the focus is expected to be prenatal alcohol exposure.\xa0\r\nApplications Not Responsive to this NOFO\r\n\xa0\xa0Applications on the following topics will not be considered responsive to this NOFO and will be withdrawn.\xa0\r\n<ul><li>HIV/AIDS related research topics</li><li>Animal studies</li></ul>It should be noted that although estimation of effect sizes is a logical step in evaluating the efficacy of a prevention or intervention strategy or treatment, studies conducted under this mechanism are likely to have small sample sizes, resulting in potentially unstable and unreliable effect size estimates that would have limited utility in power calculations for a larger clinical trial. Therefore, while encouraged, attempting to obtain an estimate of effect size is not an expected outcome.\r\nApplicants are strongly encouraged to consult the Scientific/Research Contact listed below to discuss the alignment of their proposed work with the objectives of this NOFO.\r\nSee Section VIII.

"{'The year of COVID-19 vaccine was still a deadly one in Minnesota, where deaths from all causes were more than 15% higher than expected in 2021 mostly because of the pandemic and drug abuse.\r\nMinnesota should have tallied 44,000 deaths in 2021 based on previous years, but the state has surpassed 51,000 so far and could exceed its record set in 2020 after all death certificates are recorded.\r\nMore than 5,000 COVID-19 deaths in each of the two years caused most of the excess, according to a Star Tribune analysis of available death records.\r\n""Thank God some people survive, but too many of them don\'t,"" said Stephanie Vernier of Fridley, who lost her youngest son, Ronald, and a brother to COVID-19 in December.\r\nThe excess numbers are proof the pandemic created additional harm in Minnesota and didn\'t just cause deaths that otherwise would have happened from other illnesses and injuries.\r\nFurther proof is that all excess deaths in the second year of the pandemic were among people younger than age 85.\r\nIn 2020, the oldest Minnesotans made up 45% of the state\'s COVID deaths, but that dropped to 28% last year, partly because fewer members of the greatest generation were alive and at risk by then. Total deaths among those 85 and older in 2021 were exactly as expected.\r\n""The population that is left in 2021 that survived is a different population that is missing some of the most vulnerable people,"" said Elizabeth Wrigley-Field, a University of Minnesota sociologist who has studied pandemic mortality trends.\r\nCOVID-19 vaccination played a role, protecting seniors who were the earliest recipients when the shots became available in early 2021. Vaccination rates were lower among Minnesotans younger than 65, and their COVID-19 death numbers surged from 623 in the first year of the pandemic to at least 1,285 last year.\r\n""Even in a year where you have a ton of pretty good treatments, prevention, vaccines, you still see a ton of death and not just among really sick people in long-term care who have no way of controlling exposure,"" said JP Lieder, a U public health researcher who has studied COVID-19 inequities. ""You\'re seeing it in much younger people and that\'s very correlated with vaccination status.""\r\nRonald Vernier was a warmhearted medical assistant with an unmistakable laugh who worked at a Maple Grove clinic. But he mistrusted the COVID-19 vaccine so much that he was willing to lose his job if it was mandated, his mother said. Several relatives got coronavirus infections when they gathered in November to watch a televised fight, but he was the only one hospitalized.\r\n""Ron was watching what he ate, he was working out,"" his mother said. ""That\'s why, when he first got sick, we weren\'t that concerned. We were like, \'It\'ll go away,\' but it didn\'t.""\r\nX-rays at Mercy Hospital in Coon Rapids were bright white in areas that should have been dark if his lungs were healthy. Vernier\'s breathing worsened, and he was placed on a ventilator before he died on Dec. 9 at age 42.\r\nExcess deaths were more common among minorities members, who have higher rates of chronic health problems such as diabetes and work in more front-line and customer service jobs that increase their COVID-19 risk. Deaths from all causes were 11% higher than expected last year among white Minnesotans but 81% higher among Hispanic residents and 45% to 55% higher among racial minorities.\r\nPao Yang and his wife, Kia Moua, were anticipating life beyond the pandemic, getting passports for a trip to Paris. But Moua, a paralegal with a master\'s degree, contracted COVID-19 and died at age 33 on Oct. 23 after a monthlong battle with the infectious disease. The New Hope woman, who was waiting for more safety information before getting vaccinated, was survived by three children.\r\n""My life is at a standstill,"" Yang said. ""I\'m just a zombie at the moment and still doing daddy duty. I\'m just trying to do the best I can.""\r\nAbout 10% of deaths last year in Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin were caused by COVID-19, according to federal data. The rates were above 17% in Arizona, Nevada and Texas, though. Arizona had the nation\'s highest rate in 2021 of excess death from all causes, 40% above expectations.\r\nMinnesota\'s lower rate could suggest underreporting of COVID-19 as a cause, but Lieder said that was more likely a problem in 2020 when more deaths were reported in homes. Causes are murkier when deaths occur outside hospitals or care facilities, he said.\r\nSuicides rose by 4% in 2021, accounting for little of the excess but underscoring concerns the pandemic exacerbated depression and anxiety.\r\nMinnesota recorded more than 1,000 deaths from unintentional opioid overdoses in a year for the first time, and that caused 9% of the state\'s excess in 2021. Overdose deaths had leveled off in 2018 and 2019 after the death of pop icon Prince and efforts to reduce the prescription of addictive painkillers, but they surged after that.\r\nThe explosion of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl might have increased deaths anyway especially when they are surreptitiously mixed with other illicit drugs but the pandemic added pressures, said Alicia Haugh, a spokeswoman for the Steve Rummler HOPE Network, an advocacy group seeking to reduce opioid abuse.\r\n""The pandemic ushered in a lot of stress and isolation, uncertainty and loss ... Loss of jobs, loss of the norm, and these are all factors,"" she said.\r\nGerald Greenwill never forget the panic Nov. 24 as he called and texted in search of his daughter who was expected to come home for Thanksgiving and the anguish when police arrived at his door in Elk Mound, Wis. The 34-year-old was among three who died at a house party in Fridley after they ingested a white powder that a friend found at a bar. It was cocaine laced with lethal levels of fentanyl.\r\nMany efforts to reduce overdoses are targeted at regular users, including test strips that identify fentanyl in substances, but first-time users and curious novices like Green\'s daughter remain vulnerable, he said. ""The end of a beautiful life, cut short by a fatal mistake in judgment.""\r\nThe pandemic might have exacerbated the opioid problem in other ways, said Dr. Ruth Lynfield, state epidemiologist. Lingering lung damage from known and unknown COVID-19 might have produced ""catastrophic results"" in people who otherwise might have been strong enough to survive overdoses, she said.\r\nDeaths from Alzheimer\'s disease declined 10% in Minnesota in 2021, reflecting the loss of seniors to COVID-19 a year earlier. However, deaths from diabetes increased 20% while those linked to hypertension and hypertensive liver disease increased 42%. Deaths from chronic liver disease increased 36%.\r\nUndiagnosed infections might have played a role in those excess deaths, given how often those conditions were identified in known COVID-19 fatalities. Obesity, hypertension and diabetes were underlying risks or secondary causes of 35% of COVID-19 deaths in Minnesota, according to the Star Tribune\'s analysis.\r\nPeople avoided care for serious health problems because they feared going to hospitals or lost jobs with health benefits during the pandemic, said Dr. Hannah Lichtsinn, an internal medicine specialist for Hennepin Healthcare. That could have increased the number of non-COVID deaths.\r\nOther people sought emergency care but didn\'t receive it right away last fall and winter when hospitals were ""overflowing"" with COVID-19, she added. ""We know that people did not get lifesaving care that they needed in the timeframe that could have saved their lives.""\r\nMinnesota could see fewer deaths in coming years because it lost so many people in 2021, but a decline is unlikely in 2022 because of the January omicron wave, said Dr. Jack O\'Horo, a Mayo Clinic infectious disease expert. ""That was quite a high peak in disease activity.""\r\nYang feels guilty he didn\'t persuade his wife to get vaccinated. Vernier got vaccinated despite her own reservations after her son and brother died.\r\n""After going through that,"" she said, ""it kind of changes your mind.""': ""{'PERSON': ['Stephanie Vernier', 'Ronald', 'Elizabeth Wrigley-Field', 'JP Lieder', 'Pao Yang', 'Kia Moua', 'Alicia Haugh', 'Gerald Greenwill', 'Dr. Ruth Lynfield', 'Dr. Hannah Lichtsinn', 'Dr. Jack O\\'Horo'], 'DATE': ['2021', '2020', 'in December', 'in 2020', 'early 2021', 'Nov. 24', '2022', 'on Oct. 23', 'Dec. 9'], 'LOC': ['Minnesota', 'Fridley', 'Maple Grove', 'Mercy Hospital in Coon Rapids', 'Elk Mound', 'Wis', 'Fridley', 'Paris', 'Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin', 'Arizona, Nevada and Texas', 'Arizona'], 'ORG': ['University of Minnesota', 'Star Tribune', 'Steve Rummler HOPE Network', 'Mayo Clinic', 'Hennepin Healthcare'], 'PROGRAMS': ['COVID-19 vaccination'], 'IMPACT': ['more than 15% higher death rates', 'surpassed 51,000 deaths', '5,000 COVID-19 deaths', 'Ronald Vernier died', 'Deaths from all causes were 11% higher', '81% higher death rates among Hispanic residents', '45% to 55% higher death rates among racial minorities', 'Deaths from unintentional opioid overdoses', 'Decline of 10% in Alzheimer\\'s deaths', '20% increase in deaths from diabetes', '42% increase in deaths from hypertension and hypertensive liver disease', '36% increase in deaths from chronic liver disease']}}""}"

One prominent objective is to better understand the heterogeneity in developmental trajectories of alcohol use, risky drinking, and alcohol use disorders. We know that people who initiate alcohol use at younger ages are more likely to develop alcohol use disorders. However, much is unknown about the chain of events between early initiation, episodic excessive drinking, frequent heavy drinking, and the development of an alcohol use disorder. Much is also unknown about how the various risk and protective factors at the micro- and macro-levels at different stages of life interact with each other.\xa0\r\nResearch is needed to address gaps in existing knowledge and scale up effective prevention programs. It is also needed to investigate emerging trends (e.g., increase in deaths from alcohol-associated liver disease, increase in women’s alcohol use and related harms, and upward trends in drinking among older adults as the Baby Boomer cohort ages) and develop prevention and intervention strategies at the various or multiple levels (individual, interpersonal, community, societal) to counteract them.\r\nThe salience of specific risk and protective factors varies over the life course, as well as by biological sex, gender identity, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Consequently, prevention strategies can be tailored to optimize effectiveness for a particular target group or a particular life stage.\r\nThe outcomes targeted by prevention interventions are various. Some seek to reduce early onset, binge drinking, high-intensity drinking, and alcohol use disorders. Others target health conditions including hepatic disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Others target overdose, unintentional injuries (e.g., traffic crashes and falls), interpersonal violence, or suicide. The whole matrix of risk and protective factors by alcohol-related outcomes describes a rich set of potential interventions that can be developed and targeted.\r\nSpecific Areas of Research Interest\r\nNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)\r\nGiven these considerations, this NOSI encourages studies that address NIAAA\'s priorities in epidemiology and prevention research, including, but not limited to, the following:\r\n<ul><li>Use a life course approach to examine the interplay of alcohol use and other risk and protective factors at micro- and macro-levels, from preconception to older adulthood, and across generations, that leads to alcohol misuse and related consequences as well as disabilities, mental health conditions, cancer and other chronic diseases, and premature or accelerated aging. Develop and evaluate methods to examine time-varying drinking patterns at different life stages and across the life course and evaluate the effects of alcohol exposure during particular windows of susceptibility.</li><li>Use systems science methods to model the complex, dynamic interactions of multiple factors that influence drinking behaviors and that lead to alcohol-related harms. Use such models to conduct in silico experiments of interventions to prevent or reduce adverse consequences associated with alcohol consumption.</li><li>Develop and evaluate prevention and intervention strategies tailored for developmental periods and specific populations (e.g., individuals with a disability and/or mental health conditions, and NIH-designated U.S. health disparity populations, including racial and ethnic minority groups, people with lower socioeconomic status, underserved rural communities, and sexual and gender minority groups) when universal approaches are less effective.</li><li>Advance understanding of sex and gender influences in alcohol misuse. Develop and evaluate novel strategies to reduce alcohol misuse among females across the lifespan, e.g., in adolescent girls and pregnant and breastfeeding people.</li><li>Advance prevention of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and reduce consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure for individuals and families.</li><li>Develop and evaluate strategies to prevent underage drinking and associated adverse consequences.</li><li>Develop and evaluate strategies to prevent and reduce harmful alcohol use among young adults, in college and non-college enrolled, especially those in the military and the civilian work force and other less studied populations.</li><li>Identify coping strategies specific to cultural stress and determine which coping strategies ameliorate or exacerbate the capacity for cultural stress to potentiate alcohol use among underage populations and young adults.</li><li>Understand how subjective response to alcohol and craving change during the developmentally-critical period of adolescence and young adulthood. Understand factors compelling youth and young adults to progress from initial alcohol use to harmful use to alcohol use disorder.</li><li>Identify the factors driving high-intensity drinking and evaluate strategies to reduce its prevalence.</li><li>Understand the nature and extent of harms that misuse of alcohol imposes on others and evaluate interventions to prevent or reduce such harms.</li><li>Develop and evaluate interventions to facilitate positive changes in health and behavior in an aging population, such as promoting drinking reduction or abstention, increasing awareness of alcohol’s health effects and common alcohol-interactive medications, and increasing health care access and quality such as treatment for alcohol-related problems and screening and management of chronic conditions.</li><li>Advance alcohol screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment/prevention (ASBIRT/P) and its implementation. Improve effectiveness and address research gaps (e.g., ASBI in adolescents in primary care and pediatric emergency departments, co-occurring alcohol and other substance use, and comorbid conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression).</li><li>Design and evaluate novel strategies to improve adoption, implementation, and sustainability of ASBI in healthcare, community-based, and other settings and its modifications that address co-occurring conditions.</li><li>Study the effect of public policy and other societal-level strategies on alcohol use, other substance use, and alcohol related harms at the various levels.</li><li>Advance understanding of the role of advertising, marketing, counter-marketing, and warning labels on alcohol use and related outcomes in relevant population subgroups.</li><li>Study the effects/role physical activity plays in the prevention or initiation of alcohol use.</li><li>Examine risk and protective factors and harms associated with concurrent or simultaneous use of alcohol with other substances, such as tobacco and nicotine (including vaping), cannabis, opioids (including fentanyl), and other drugs. Identify and evaluate strategies to prevent adverse consequences associated with co-use of alcohol and other substances.</li><li>Examine the linkages between alcohol misuse and various health conditions, both mental and somatic, and develop and evaluate interventions targeting common factors and sharing biopsychosocial pathways of multimorbidity to increase intervention effectiveness and improve health and well-being.</li><li>Further the development, validation, use and implementation of ecological momentary assessment and other techniques for measuring drinking patterns, testing or refining etiology models, and developing and evaluating in-the-moment prevention.</li><li>Leverage wearable biosensors, digital technologies (including virtual reality), and data science (including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing) to advance alcohol epidemiology and prevention research.

"{'The nation’s drug overdose epidemic worsened in 2021 with\xa0deaths surpassing 100,000 during the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\r\nThe CDC\'s National Center for Health Statistics figures released Wednesday show a record 107,622 drug overdose deaths during 2021, a 14.9% increase from 93,655 overdose deaths the previous year.\xa0\r\nWhile the provisional numbers are subject to change as medical examiners\xa0finish death\xa0investigations and report all cases nationwide, experts say the figures underscore\xa0the powerful and dangerous reach of predominately illicit drugs and drug combinations.\r\nWhile prescription painkillers and heroin drove the nation\'s overdose epidemic\xa0last\xa0decade, the\xa0powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl is now responsible for most overdose deaths.\xa0Overdose deaths\xa0from fentanyl accelerated to 71,238 \xa0last year\xa0from 57,834 in 2020, according to the CDC.\xa0\r\nIllicit versions of fentanyl\xa0have increasingly been manufactured in clandestine labs overseas, sold on the black market and mixed with other street drugs. The street version is different than legal fentanyl, a powerful pain medicine vetted by the Food and Drug Administration and prescribed in medical settings to\xa0treat intense pain flares in cancer patients.\r\nIllicit fentanyl has been the driving cause of the current wave of overdose deaths, said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\r\n""The synthetic opioid fentanyl has injected itself throughout our whole country,"" said Volkow. ""It\'s everywhere.""\r\nStimulants such as methamphetamine were detected in 32,856 overdose deaths and cocaine in\xa024,538 deaths. In\xa0many cases, more than one drug is found in a fatal mixture of substances,\r\nExperts say illicitly manufactured fentanyl is often mixed with cocaine, methamphetamine or even counterfeit prescription opioids sold on the street.\xa0\r\nPeople who intend to purchase non-opioid street drugs might have no idea they are getting a toxic combination cut with with fentanyl. And for a person who has built no tolerance for opioids, whether prescription pain pills, heroin or street fentanyl, taking street drugs cut with fentanyl can be fatal.\xa0\r\n""We\'re finding that people are overdosing because they\'ve had no exposure to opioids that powerful,"" said Chris Delcher, a University of Kentucky professor and\xa0director of the\xa0Institute for Pharmaceutical Outcomes &amp; Policy. ""We like to categorize our deaths to a single drug or a single\xa0cause of death. What\'s happening right now on the street is\xa0this incredible experiment in combinations of drugs.""\r\nMore: Amid backlash from chronic pain sufferers, CDC drops hard thresholds from opioid guidance\r\nThe Biden administration\'s drug control strategy includes expanding access to the overdose reversal drug naloxone, fentanyl test strips and sterile needles. These techniques, known as harm reduction, aim to both prevent overdoses and reduce disease transmission.\xa0\r\nThe Biden plan cited the importance of ""syringe services"" programs that provide access to and disposal of clean needles and injection equipment and links to substance use disorder treatment. The plan calls for increasing the number of syringe services programs in counties with high overdose rates and expanding the use of fentanyl test strips. Studies have shown\xa0drug users who deployed test strips that detected fentanyl were more likely to switch to safer methods such as taking\xa0a smaller amount or avoiding the drug.\r\nThe Biden plan also aims to increase access to medications such as buprenorphine for people seeking treatment for opioid addiction.\xa0\r\nIt\'s the first time an administration has named harm reduction techniques as part of a national drug control policy, said\xa0Daliah Heller,\xa0vice president of drug use initiatives for Vital Strategies, a global public health nonprofit organization.\r\n""The federal government can really play a leading role in pushing states to expand access to programs on the ground,""\xa0Heller said.\r\nBiden\'s plan cited research that shows drug users who have access to needle-exchange programs are more likely to seek drug treatment, and these programs help reduce transmission of HIV and Hepatitis C among drug users.\r\nStill, 11 states prohibit the operation of needle exchange programs. Republican Senators Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, and Joe Manchin, a Democrat from\xa0 West Virginia, have introduced legislation that would prohibit spending federal dollars\xa0to buy needles\xa0or ""other paraphernalia"" for use at syringe services centers.\r\nDelcher, of the University of Kentucky, said operating a successful syringe services center is challenging even when states allow such programs. Some health care providers might be reluctant or unavailable to serve people at such centers. And these centers need to build trust and rapport among drug users they intend to help.\xa0\r\n""Even when you manage to establish a program like that, it still doesn\'t mean it will effectively be used,""\xa0Delcher said. ""There\'s still that stigma. There are still\xa0those health care providers who wouldn\'t want to be part of that.

"{'<ul><li>This head-to-head pharmacodynamic study in healthy volunteers examined the ability of both OPVEE and intranasal naloxone to reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression, which is the shallow and slow breathing associated with an opioid overdose</li><li>In this model, OPVEE 2.7mg reversed respiratory depression to 95% of pre-opioid baseline within 5 minutes; a similar reversal following a 4 mg dose of intranasal naloxone required 20 minutes</li></ul>RICHMOND, Va., March 11, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Indivior PLC (LSE/Nasdaq: INDV) today announced results from a pharmacodynamic study demonstrating that OPVEE® rapidly reverses opioid-induced respiratory depression, which is the major cause of deaths due to opioid overdose. The study, ""Reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in healthy volunteers: comparison of intranasal nalmefene and intranasal naloxone"", was published in the Journal of Clinical Pharmacology (Reversal of OpioidInduced Respiratory Depression in Healthy Volunteers: Comparison of Intranasal Nalmefene and Intranasal Naloxone - Ellison - The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology - Wiley Online Library\r\n) and is the first head-to-head comparison examining the effects of 2.7 mg intranasal (IN) nalmefene (OPVEE) and 4 mg IN naloxone on opioid-induced respiratory depression. This study was a part of the OPVEE development program and reviewed by the FDA as part of the approval process.\r\nThis study met the primary endpoint by demonstrating that OPVEE reversed the respiratory depression produced by remifentanil, a potent synthetic opioid related to fentanyl, within the first 5 minutes following administration.\xa0Both OPVEE and IN naloxone produced a time-dependent reversal of the opioid-induced respiratory depression 2.5 to 20 minutes post administration. Point estimates favored\xa0OPVEE, demonstrating non-inferiority and superiority to naloxone. After\xa0OPVEE administration, subjects\' minute ventilation (a measure of the amount of air that enters the lungs per minute) reached approximately 95% of the pre-opioid baseline within 5 minutes and maintained this robust reversal through the initial 20-minute monitoring period. By contrast, naloxone required 20 minutes to restore respiration to levels equaling those observed 5 minutes after OPVEE.\xa0There is an urgent need for rapid acting reversal agents because synthetic opioids, like fentanyl, impair breathing and reduce oxygen levels to vital organs like the brain more rapidly than other opioids such as morphine and heroin.\xa0\r\n""This study provides the first head-to-head comparison of IN OPVEE and IN naloxone in a clinical model of opioid-induced respiratory depression. While both reverse the effects of remifentanil induced respiratory depression, this pharmacodynamic study provides important insights about the time course of reversal for both drugs,"" said Christian Heidbreder, Ph.D. and Chief Scientific Officer of Indivior. ""The first few minutes following an overdose particularly with very potent and fast acting synthetic opioids like fentanyl are critical for a successful rescue.\xa0OPVEE reverses the respiratory depression rapidly in this model, making it a valuable tool for combating the synthetic opioid overdose crisis we\'re facing as a nation.""\r\nFollowing administration of OPVEE, subjects\' minute ventilation (MV), a measure of how much a person is breathing, increased by an average of 5.75 L/min at 5 minutes, the study\'s primary endpoint. Intranasal naloxone produced a mean increase of 3.01 L/min at 5 minutes post-administration, and 20 minutes was required to produce an increase in MV similar to that observed 5 minutes after OPVEE.\r\nAdverse events (AEs) occurred in 91.8% of subjects following OPVEE and 86.7% of subjects following IN naloxone. The authors conclude that the AEs observed in this study are most likely related to remifentanil and hypercapnic experimental conditions used and not the drugs under investigation. The most common adverse events were headache (59.0% following OPVEE and 58.3% following intranasal naloxone), nausea (39.3% and 41.7%), vomiting (11.5% and 23.3%), and dizziness (18.0% and 21.7%). Adverse events were mild or moderate, with no subjects reporting a serious adverse event.\r\nIn the United States, the provisional number of reported opioid overdose deaths reached 80,318 in the 12 months ending in September 2023.1 The reported overdose deaths linked to synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, during the same period was 73,686, representing more than 90% of all opioid overdose fatalities.\r\nAbout the Study\r\nThis study was an open-label, head-to-head, randomized, 2-period, 2-treatment crossover noninferiority study designed to model the pharmacodynamic effects of intranasal OPVEE® (nalmefene) and intranasal naloxone. A total of 69 opioid-experienced, non -dependent healthy male and female volunteers were randomized to receive study drugs. Subjects breathed a hypercapnic gas mixture containing 7% carbon dioxide and their minute ventilation (MV) was monitored. Minute ventilation is a measure of how deeply and rapidly a patient is breathing and is reduced by opioid exposure.2 Previous work has demonstrated that opioids blunt the increase in MV that normally occurs with hypercapnia (excessive carbon dioxide in the bloodstream) and that opioid antagonists can reverse this effect.3-7 After 10 minutes of breathing the hypercapnic gas mixture, subjects were administered a loading dose of remifentanil followed by a continuous infusion of remifentanil to maintain steady state plasma concentrations. After 25 minutes, the subjects were administered a single dose of either intranasal OPVEE 2.7 mg or intranasal naloxone 4 mg and MV was monitored. The primary objectives were to demonstrate noninferiority at the primary endpoint of 5 minutes after antagonist exposure of IN nalmefene to reverse remifentanil-induced reductions in MV and to determine the tolerability of IN nalmefene during remifentanil infusion. Of the 69 subjects who received a single dose of either IN nalmefene or IN naloxone, a total of 52 subjects received both treatments and data was collected at the primary endpoint in 50 subjects.\r\nAbout OPVEE®\xa0\r\nOPVEE (nalmefene) nasal spray\r\nINDICATION\r\nOPVEE nasal spray is an opioid antagonist indicated for the emergency treatment of known or suspected overdose induced by natural or synthetic opioids in adults and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older, as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression.\r\nOPVEE nasal spray is intended for immediate administration as emergency therapy in settings where opioids may be present.\r\nOPVEE nasal spray is not a substitute for emergency medical care.\r\nHIGHLIGHTED SAFETY INFORMATION\r\nCONTRAINDICATIONS\r\nHypersensitivity to nalmefene or to any of the other ingredients.\r\nWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\r\nRisk of Recurrent Respiratory and Central Nervous System Depression\r\n: While the duration of action of\xa0nalmefene is as long as most opioids, a recurrence of respiratory depression is possible, therefore, keep patient under continued surveillance and administer repeat doses of OPVEE using a new nasal spray with each dose, as necessary, while awaiting emergency medical assistance.\r\nLimited Efficacy with Partial Agonists or Mixed Agonist/Antagonists\r\n: Reversal of respiratory depression caused by partial agonists or mixed agonists/antagonists, such as buprenorphine and pentazocine, may be incomplete. Larger or repeat doses may be required.\r\nPrecipitation of Severe Opioid Withdrawal\r\n: Use in patients who are opioid dependent may precipitate opioid withdrawal. In neonates, opioid withdrawal may be life-threatening if not recognized and properly treated. Monitor for the development of opioid withdrawal.\r\nRisk of Cardiovascular (CV) Effects\r\n: Abrupt postoperative reversal of opioid depression may result in adverse CV effects. These events have primarily occurred in patients who had preexisting CV disorders or received other drugs that may have similar adverse CV effects. Monitor these patients closely in an appropriate healthcare setting after use of nalmefene hydrochloride.\r\nRisk of Opioid Overdose from Attempts to Overcome the Blockade\r\n: Attempts to overcome opioid withdrawal symptoms caused by opioid antagonists with high or repeated doses of exogenous opioids may lead to opioid intoxication and death.\r\nADVERSE REACTIONS\r\nMost common adverse reactions (incidence at least 2%) are nasal discomfort, headache, nausea, dizziness, hot flush, vomiting, anxiety, fatigue, nasal congestion, throat irritation, rhinalgia, decreased appetite, dysgeusia, erythema, and hyperhidrosis.\r\nFor more information about OPVEE and the full Prescribing Information visit www.opvee.com\r\n.\r\nAbout Indivior\r\nIndivior is a global pharmaceutical company working to help change patients\' lives by developing medicines to treat substance use disorders (SUD) and serious mental illnesses.

It tracks the machine\'s customer base and product dispensing. A report from March 1, 2021, to Sept. 30 this year shows an ""overwhelming"" response to the strategy, said Caracole CEO Linda Seiter.\r\n""We have provided life-saving supplies for persons who use drugs 24 hours a day, seven days a week,” Seiter said.\r\nNation\'s second safer drug-use vending machine gets noticed\r\nThe safer-use machine was only the second of its kind in the country when it became available to people who use drugs, with the first harm-reduction vending program in Las Vegas. Since then, the Cincinnati-based machine has reached more than 800 individuals, and it has become an avenue for harm reduction help for a client base that isn’t always reached by such efforts: people who smoke, rather than inject, drugs. And that can include recreational drug users.\r\nHarm reduction is the effort to give people who use drugs practical ways to minimize their health risks in a nonjudgmental manner. Syringe exchanges, which provide sterile needles to drug users to reduce the chances of getting HIV or hepatitis C and containers for used syringes for safe disposal, are among those strategies.\r\nThe region\'s vending machine is a model strategy in the country for fighting overdoses and overdose deaths while helping those who use drugs stay healthy in other ways. Caracole’s prevention team has had 57 meetings with individuals from communities across the country how to do it since the machine\'s inception.\r\n\'Rainbow fentanyl\' and Narcan in schools: What you need to know about illicit fentanyl\r\n""We can share everything,"" said Suzanne Bachmeyer, Caracole\'s prevention director.\r\nShe’s talked to New York City and Philadelphia health departments\xa0and dozens of other community-based harm reduction groups and health officials.\r\nThroughout the country, vending machines are becoming a sought-after way to prevent harm and death from drug use. In Kentucky\'s Hardin County, a vending machine stocked with Narcan that opened to the public early in October ran out of the opioid overdose antidote in less than two days.\r\nIn central Ohio, the Franklin County commissioners and Columbus Public Health are partnering in a prevention vending pilot program as part of a comprehensive strategy to reduce overdose deaths and prevent other drug-use health risks.\r\nSo how does this machine work?\r\nThe operation at Caracole works this way: There’s a phone number on the machine for people to call (or they can walk into Caracole if it’s open). They’re given a code that’s good for 90 days of accessing the machine for up to one item per week. Those registered are asked to answer a few questions that don’t jeopardize anonymity. If they’d like to continue to use the vending machine after that 90 days, they can reregister for another three months.\r\nThe registration gives Caracole prevention staff a chance to collect a few demographics of their users, get feedback from clients, and further engage them if it makes sense to do so. As a result, Caracole has provided education about HIV, hepatitis C and referrals, when requested, for medical care to those registered, Seiter said.\r\nClient feedback includes these details:\r\n<ul><li>Naloxone products have been used to reverse 596 overdoses.</li><li>The pregnancy tests dispensed have detected 16 pregnancies (and some of the pregnant people have been connected to prenatal care).</li></ul>\r\nA new client base: People who smoke drugs\r\nOne of the most engaged client bases has been people who smoke drugs, primarily cocaine and methamphetamine, Seiter said. The machine is stocked with two types of safer-smoking kits. Records show that 4,183 of the kits have been dispensed, which is almost a third of all items dispensed.\r\nAnd that has encouraged the Caracole prevention staff, because people who smoke, and especially recreational drug users, don\'t commonly go to safe syringes sites, which offer other safer-use items, Bachmeyer said.\r\nVisual explainer: How to use Narcan to treat a fentanyl overdose\r\n""The population of people who don’t use opioids &amp;mldr; doesn’t get a lot of outreach,"" she said. ""It is a really low to no-barrier way to access supplies.""\r\nWhat\'s particularly important with the kits now, as fentanyl overdose deaths pummel the nation, is that the safer-smoking kits provide Narcan and fentanyl test strips. Fentanyl and its analogs have been found in meth and cocaine, and the test strips let this population know if their supply is tainted.\r\nClients want to discard syringes safely\r\nThe demand among Caracole\'s vending customers is also high for the vending machine\'s safe needle disposal containers, Seiter said. More than 1,000 of these sharps containers have been dispensed.\r\nShe said that\'s encouraging: Having the containers for used syringes and bringing those syringes back to exchanges for sterile ones limits the spread of infectious diseases in the general community because people aren\'t haphazardly dropping used syringes.\r\nThe machine doesn\'t provide sterile syringes, although Caracole is among several safe syringe sites in Hamilton County. It does have safer-injection kits that contain cotton, alcohol pads, cookers, or metal containers for mixing water with powder drugs and heating the solution, tourniquets and education.': ""{'PERSON': ['Linda Seiter', 'Suzanne Bachmeyer'], 'DATE': ['2021', 'March 1, 2021', 'Sept. 30 this year', '90 days', 'less than two days', 'early in October'], 'LOC': ['CINCINNATI', 'Caracole', 'Las Vegas', 'New York City', 'Philadelphia', 'Kentucky\\'s Hardin County', 'central Ohio', 'Franklin County', 'Columbus', 'Hamilton County'], 'ORG': ['Caracole\\'s prevention'], 'PROGRAMS': ['safer drug-use vending machine', 'Narcan', 'safer smoking products', 'fentanyl test strips', 'harm reduction vending program', 'prevention vending pilot program', 'safer-smoking kits', 'safe needle disposal containers', 'safer-injection kits'], 'IMPACT': ['Nearly 600 overdoses turned around', '13,000 safer drug use and healthcare items dispensed', 'reached more than 800 individuals', 'helping those who use drugs stay healthy', 'prevent harm and death from drug use', '596 overdoses reversed', '16 pregnancies detected', 'education about HIV, hepatitis C provided', 'referrals for medical care', 'limits the spread of infectious diseases']}}""}"

Applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the Application Guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in Section IV. When the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the Application Guide, follow the program-specific instructions.\r\nApplications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.\r\n\xa0\xa0Background\r\nPrenatal alcohol exposure is a leading preventable cause of birth defects and neurodevelopmental deficits in the United States. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) can occur in individuals who were prenatally exposed to alcohol. Alcohol can disrupt prenatal development at any stage during pregnancy, including the earliest stages, often before a woman knows that she is pregnant. A 2018 study estimated that 1 to 5 percent children in the first grade in the US have FASD, the majority of whom were previously undiagnosed.\r\nFASD is an umbrella term for a range of physical, cognitive, and behavioral abnormalities caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. FASD may include any disorder within the FASD spectrum, e.g. fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS (pFAS), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD), and neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE).\r\nAs prenatal alcohol exposure leads to heterogeneous clinical and non-clinical symptoms, individuals with FASD tend to have their own unique combination of day-to-day challenges, which may include medical, behavioral, educational, and social problems. People with FASD may have difficulty in areas of neurocognition (including global intellectual impairment, executive function deficits, poor working memory, learning problems);\xa0 self-regulation (impulse control problems, impaired mood or behavioral regulation, attention deficits, organization difficulties); and adaptive functioning (communication issues, problems with daily living, poor social skills, gross or fine motor delay).\xa0Individuals are affected differently, with some having minor impairments in a single domain, whereas others have multiple difficulties and a lifelong developmental disability.\r\nThrough this initiative, NIAAA is interested in developing evidence-based prevention strategies to reduce the incidence of FASD and interventions/treatments to lessen the deficits in individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. Reports from prenatal clinics and postnatal studies suggest that as many as 20-30 percent of women drink at some time during pregnancy. Several risk factors have been identified that place offspring at higher risk for FASD, including the level of alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy, later initiation of prenatal care, family history of drinking, and other factors.\r\nOver the past decade, NIAAA supported the development of various treatment approaches using dietary supplements, sensorimotor training, behavioral interventions, and parenting strategies to improve outcomes in individuals with FASD.\xa0 Similarly, NIAAA has funded research into screening, brief interventions, and treatment approaches for high-risk and vulnerable populations, including pregnant women. Despite these investments, challenges remain, with a critical need to build the evidence base for interventions to improve outcomes in individuals with FASD and for prevention strategies, including primary, secondary, and tertiary approaches, to decrease alcohol use during pregnancy and the incidence of FASD.\xa0\r\nResearch Scope\r\nThis NOFO encourages studies that propose strategies for prevention of FASD or intervention for individuals affected by FASD throughout the lifespan, through an R61/R33 mechanism. The R61 phase is the first two (2) years of the award, while the R33 spans the following three (3) years. The R61 phase supports initial technical development and proof-of-principle projects, whereas the R33 phase supports further development, application, and evaluation of clinical utility to lay the foundation with which to pursue a larger efficacy trial or study. The application should provide clear aims and measurable objectives for each phase of the proposed research, with explicit discussion of how the results of the R61 phase will inform the R33 phase. Initiation of the second (R33) phase of support is contingent upon successful accomplishment of the objectives and milestones investigators set out in the first (R61) phase of their research.\r\nThis NOFO is intended to support biomedical, behavioral, social sciences research in prevention and/or intervention, including new, exploratory and developmental efforts. Applicants should explicate a clear conceptual link between relevant biomedical, psychological, behavioral, or social factors, and the prevention or intervention components being proposed (including a description of the mechanism of action by which these components are hypothesized to have an effect), and their relationship to the outcomes that are being targeted.\xa0\r\nResearch aims may include, but are not limited to, determination of dosing levels and duration; side effects and safety monitoring; demonstration that outcome measures have appropriate sensitivity to change in the target population; demonstration of feasibility (implementing the intervention and study procedures, evaluating attrition); and working out details of the experimental protocol (e.g., the assessment, experimental intervention and comparison intervention protocols; and randomization procedures, if appropriate).\xa0\r\nStudy topics include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n<ul><li>Design and evaluate novel policy, community-based, and health messaging and other behavioral and social science approaches to help women reduce or abstain from drinking during pregnancy</li><li>Advance strategies to reduce stigmatization of women who use(d) alcohol, biological mothers of children with FASD, and individuals with FASD</li><li>Improve current prevention strategies to reduce use of alcohol in women of childbearing age</li><li>Identify and mitigate risk factors in populations with high incidence rates of FASD</li><li>Design and evaluate cost-effective, culturally sensitive interventions aimed at preventing FASD in high risk and vulnerable, and diverse populations</li><li>Understand the effects of policies regarding alcohol consumption on maternal health and infant outcomes</li><li>Develop and evaluate prenatal and postnatal therapeutic approaches, medications, and/or dietary components to mitigate the physical, neurocognitive and behavioral deficits associated with FASD across the lifespan</li><li>Advance approaches for parenting/caregiver skills development to improve care for children with FASD</li><li>Develop school-based methods focused on specialized teaching strategies and approaches, including implementation strategies</li><li>Develop and evaluate innovative approaches to improve health and quality of life for individuals with FASD and their families</li><li>Evaluate and implement interventions previously shown to be effective in populations with developmental disabilities for use in individuals with FASD</li><li>Evaluate models for improving identification and access to care for individuals with FASD, such as integration into developmental disability health care services and networks, utilization of telemedicine, or novel technologies.</li></ul>Milestones\r\nThe R61 phase supports initial technical development and proof-of-principle projects, whereas the R33 phase supports further development, application, and evaluation of clinical utility to lay the foundation with which to pursue a larger efficacy trial or study. The application should provide clear aims and measurable objectives for each phase of the proposed research, with explicit discussion of how the results of the R61 phase will inform the R33 phase.\xa0Projects should include the following:\r\nIdentification of previous studies and data that will be used to generate or support hypotheses about prevention and/or intervention research in the R33 phase\r\nMeasurable outcomes for the R61 phase studies, i.e. an intervention protocol, pilot projects, feasibility data\r\nClear milestones for the R61 phase and related scientific goals for the R33 phase\r\nProposed pre-clinical studies during the R61 should translate to clinical human studies during the R33 phase\r\nThe objectives for the R33 phase should be based on the findings from the R61 phase. Examples of the goals for the R33 phase include, but are not limited to:\r\nIdentification of points of prevention or intervention for alcohol use or alcohol use disorder, based on the biological response and amount and timing of prenatal alcohol exposure\r\nStudies of pharmacological targets or drug candidates for prevention of FASD or intervention to improve FASD-related outcomes\r\nIdentification of specific targets and intervention components based on psychosocial mechanisms\xa0Rigorous efficacy or effectiveness trials of prevention strategies and/or interventions that translate into clinical practice; studies that assess implementation and scalability of efficacious prevention strategies, policy, and/or interventions.\r\nTransition to the R33 phase is contingent upon programmatic review that will include, but is not limited to, satisfactory demonstration that the R61 milestones have been achieved. Transition to the R33 phase is not guaranteed for all grants awarded under this NOFO.\r\nNotes on priorities\r\nThe main goal of this opportunity is to support research on prevention and intervention strategies to reduce prenatal alcohol exposure and its effects. Applications relating to prenatal exposure to multiple substances (nicotine, cannabis, opioids, methamphetamine, and/or prescription drugs) will be considered as responsive; however, the focus is expected to be prenatal alcohol exposure. Animal experiments may be necessary for pre-clinical testing; however, the focus of this NOFO\xa0 is the translation of findings.\xa0\r\nApplications Not Responsive to this NOFO\xa0\r\nApplications on the following topics will not be considered responsive to this NOFO \xa0and will not be reviewed.\r\n<ul><li>HIV/AIDS related research topics</li><li>Animal research only. (Research strategies must contain components of clinical translation during the R33 phase of the award.)</li></ul>It should be noted that although estimation of effect sizes is a logical step in evaluating the efficacy of a prevention or intervention strategy or treatment, studies conducted under this mechanism are likely to have small sample sizes, resulting in potentially unstable and unreliable effect size estimates that would have limited utility in power calculations for a larger clinical trial. Therefore, while encouraged, attempting to obtain an estimate of effect size is not an expected outcome.\r\nApplicants are strongly encouraged to consult the Scientific/Research Contact listed below to discuss the alignment of their proposed work with the objectives of this NOFO.\r\nSee Section VIII. Other Information for award authorities and regulations.\r\nInvestigators proposing NIH-defined clinical trials may refer to the Research Methods Resources website for information about developing statistical methods and study designs.\r\nGrant: A financial assistance mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.\r\nApplication Types Allowed \r\nThe\xa0OER Glossary\xa0and the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide provide details on these application types. Only those application types listed here are allowed for this NOFO.\r\nOptional: Accepting applications that either propose or do not propose clinical trial(s).\r\nFunds Available and Anticipated Number of Awards \r\nThe number of awards is contingent upon NIH appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.\r\nFor the R61 phase, the combined budget for direct costs during the two-year project period may not exceed $350,000 with no more than $225,000 requested in a single year. For the R33 phase, the direct costs must not exceed $500,000 per year.\r\nThe project period is limited to 2 years for the R61 phase and up to 3 years for the R33 phase. The total project period may not exceed 5 years.\r\nNIH grants policies as described in the NIH Grants Policy Statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made from this NOFO.\r\n1.

For the R61 phase, the specific aims should be focused on experiments that will test the proposed innovative concept/hypothesis. For the R33 Phase, the specific aims should outline generally the plan to explore the innovative concept/hypothesis if it is unambiguously supported by the experiments in the R61 phase.\r\nResearch Strategy:\r\nThe Research Strategy should contain separate sections that describe the R61 and R33 phases.\r\nR61 Phase:\r\nApplicants should include one or more critical experiments for rigorously testing the proposed concept/hypothesis. These experiments must be scientifically justified, specific, and feasible. Applicants should state explicitly the results that support, reject, or are inconclusive regarding testing of their concept/hypothesis, and are strongly encouraged to calculate and report effect size, in addition to statistical significance, whenever possible.\r\nPreliminary Data:\r\nAn R61/R33 grant application need not have preliminary data, but they may be included if available.\r\nMilestones:\r\nTransition from the R61 to the R33 phase is contingent upon the successful completion of proposed milestones. These milestones are to be included as the last element of the Research Strategy section of the application and will be evaluated as part of the scientific and technical merit of the R61/R33 application.

The NoA signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the recipient\'s business official.\r\nRecipients must comply with any funding restrictions described in Section IV.6. Funding Restrictions. Selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. Any costs incurred before receipt of the NoA are at the recipient\'s risk. These costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs.\r\nAny application awarded in response to this NOFO will be subject to terms and conditions found on the Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants website.\xa0 This includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website.\r\nIndividual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the NIH and are subject to the IC-specific terms and conditions identified in the NoA.\r\nClinicalTrials.gov: If an award provides for one or more clinical trials. By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the ""responsible party"" must register and submit results information for certain “applicable clinical trials” on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website (https://register.clinicaltrials.gov). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm\r\nInstitutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.\r\nData and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&amp;R) and PHS 398).\r\nInvestigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE).\r\n2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements\r\nAll NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the NIH Grants Policy Statement as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General and Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Recipients, and Activities, including of note, but not limited to:\r\nIf a recipient is successful and receives a Notice of Award, in accepting the award, the recipient agrees that any activities under the award are subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other Department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions.\r\nIf a recipient receives an award, the recipient must follow all applicable nondiscrimination laws. The recipient agrees to this when registering in SAM.gov. The recipient must also submit an Assurance of Compliance (HHS-690). To learn more, see the HHS Office for Civil Rights website.\r\nHHS recognizes that NIH research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this NOFO.\r\nIn accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) requirements. FAPIIS requires Federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS) prior to making an award. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a Federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR Part 200.206 “Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.\r\nNot Applicable\r\n3. Data Management and Sharing\r\nConsistent with the 2023 NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the Data Management and Sharing requirements as outlined in the NIH Grants Policy Statement.

Projects include pragmatic, implementation, or hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials to improve pain management and reduce the use of opioid medications. Awards made under this FOA will initially support a milestone-driven planning phase (UG3) of 1 to 2 years, with possible transition to an implementation phase (UH3) of up to 4 years duration (5 years total for the two phases). Only UG3 projects that plan a pilot may request 2 years for the planning phase with up to 3 years for the UH3 implementation phase; all other projects may request 1 year for the UG3 phase with up to 4 years for the UH3 phase. UG3 projects that have met the scientific milestone and feasibility requirements may request a transition to the UH3 phase. The UG3/UH3 application must be submitted as a single application, following the instructions described in this FOA.\r\nThe overall goal of this initiative is to support the implementation of effective practices and procedures that may lead to prevention or improved management of chronic pain in rural and/or remote populations, along with a reduction in prescribing and/or using opioids. Results from the trials supported by this funding opportunity announcement (FOA) should inform policy makers, payers, community stakeholders, as well as healthcare providers and patients in the primary care, emergency department, hospital, community health, home health, or dental settings. This FOA requires that the intervention under study be integrated into the health care delivery system that serves individuals who live in a rural or remote community. This does not require the physical setting of the intervention be at a traditional health care facility. Studies can propose to integrate multi-component or multiple interventions that have demonstrated efficacy in other settings.\r\nTrials will become part of and work with the HEAL Pragmatic and Implementation Studies to Improve the Management of Pain and Reduce Opioid Prescribing (PRISM) Program, which has leveraged the infrastructure of the NIH Pragmatic Trials Collaboratory [previously known as the NIH Health Care Systems (HCS) Research Collaboratory]. (See https://rethinkingclinicaltrials.org/.) The PRISM Program has established a Coordinating Center (CC) that is providing national leadership and technical expertise in all aspects of research conducted within the HCS. Awarded applicants will work with the CC (http://rethinkingclinicaltrials.org/about-nih-collaboratory/) to facilitate further planning and refinement of the proposed study in partnership with health care delivery systems. Studies in collaboration with Tribal populations will need to engage in meaningful dialogue to respectfully recognize the sovereignty of each Nation.\r\nFor this application, rural is defined according to the Health Resources &amp; Services Administration (HRSA) definition: All non-metro counties, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget; all metro census tracts with Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes 4-10; and large area metro census tracts of at least 400 square miles in an area with population density of 35 or less per square mile with RUCA codes 2-3; and outlying metro counties without a UA. For more detail on the addition of outlying metro counties, read the Federal Register Notice, Revised Geographic Eligibility for Federal Office of Rural Health Policy Grants. The HRSA Rural Health Grants Eligibility Analyzer can be used to determine which counties and locations are rural areas. HRSA also provides data files to identify rural areas by county, census tract, and those using a zip code approximation. Remote areas, defined by USDA Frontier and Remote (FAR) Area Code 4, are considered both rural and remote; therefore, the definition of rural above will be used for eligibility. The USDA provides data files and maps using the FAR codes. Rural and remote areas may include American Indian and/or Alaska Native Tribal populations.\r\nBackground\r\nRural communities have been particularly hard hit by the opioid epidemic and are disproportionately impacted by opioid-related overdoses. However, patients with chronic pain are present across all geographic areas, and recent evidence indicates that the percentage of adults with chronic pain increases as the place of residence becomes more rural. Furthermore, many patients with chronic pain have comorbidities, including mental health conditions, sleep disturbance, and opioid and/or alcohol use disorders that complicate appropriate pain management. There are known disparities in management of pain in rural areas. Rural residents are more likely to be prescribed an opioid analgesic and less likely to use non-opioid interventions such as self-management, or traditional or cultural interventions for pain than those in non-rural areas. Despite evidence for effective non-opioid interventions, these interventions are not optimally implemented in rural areas.\r\nPain, like other health conditions, is shaped by biological, behavioral, and social determinants of health. To fully address the factors affecting quality pain management, the interrelationships between health policy, healthcare services, biology and genetics, individual behaviors and social factors must be examined. Development and implementation of sustainable, effective non-opioid chronic pain management in rural and remote areas require attention to the social and environmental determinants of health that affect overall health.\r\nIn rural settings, primary care practitioners, including physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants are responsible for addressing patients’ needs for pain management while reducing opioid use. Limited community resources and/or long distances to reach specialists such as behavioral health, pain specialists, and physical therapists increase the challenges of chronic pain management in rural communities. While there have been some promising studies integrating effective, evidence-based pain management in rural settings, there is still a need for coordinated approaches to identify and reduce barriers and accelerate the implementation of high-quality chronic pain care to optimize health and advance health equity.\r\nThere are both guidelines published by various government agencies and clinical and professional societies and evidence for supporting the use of nonpharmacologic approaches as first tier treatment and non-opioid approaches for second tier treatment of chronic pain. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain, for example, states that ""nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy are preferred for chronic pain."" The Clinical Practice Guideline from the American College of Physicians also recommends noninvasive, nonopioid treatments for acute, subacute, and chronic low back pain.\r\nThis FOA will support trials testing methods for management of acute pain if the acute pain requires the intervention of a health care provider for management, such as acute dental/orofacial pain or acute low back pain and are likely to recur, become chronic, or escalate to a more serious complication if not managed appropriately.\r\nPragmatic, implementation, and hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials, therefore, are needed because policies, clinical practice guidelines, and tools and interventions have not been readily adopted or adapted and implemented in rural and remote settings. Research is needed to study strategies to equitably and efficiently implement effective interventions and evidence-based pain management guidelines in these settings.\r\nTo effectively address the barriers to and preferences for implementation in rural communities, community engagement, including identification and integration of one or more community-based partners in the UG3 phase are critical to this initiative. Community partnership(s) will be developed in the UG3 phase, but investigators will need to identify the role and characteristics of desirable community partners in the application. Community partner(s) should be located in the rural or remote community and might be a community organization, faith-based organization, community health worker, local library, school, local patient or consumer advocacy group, community champion, or group representing populations that experience health disparities and/or other relevant community stakeholder groups. Community engagement in clinical studies involves patients, families and/or their representatives, health professionals, and the clinical research team working in active partnership at various levels across the continuum of clinical research. Continued respectful, equitable, and bidirectional knowledge transfer during stakeholder engagement can improve participant retention and adherence to the study protocol. Engagement can help build trust in communities that may be fearful of participating in clinical research because of stigmas and medical mistrust. Community engagement can be used to promote health and health research by reducing barriers and enabling research participation by NIH-designated populations that experience health disparities and populations with limited English proficiency. Community-engaged research (CEnR) is participatory and describes methods to operationalize community engagement within clinical research. Engaging the community in research (CEnR) from study planning to implementation contributes to successful health equity study design that is inclusive of diverse participants and provides infrastructure to ensure culturally appropriate research strategies, tools, bi-directional knowledge transfer, and information dissemination are utilized. Partnering with the community helps with development of sustainable interventions and the translation of study results into practice, potentially improving health outcomes. CEnR has the potential to promote wellness by impacting community health literacy and health behavior through community and participant empowerment. When community members participate in their own health promotion by engaging in the research process, they are able to identify their own health needs and develop a sense of belonging within the scientific and medical research community.\r\nThe NIH HEAL Initiative:\r\nThis FOA is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain management. More information about the HEAL Initiative is available at: https://heal.nih.gov/.\r\nMeeting Attendance:\r\nThe NIH HEAL Initiative will require a high level of coordination and sharing between investigators. It is expected that NIH HEAL Initiative awardees will cooperate and coordinate their activities after awards are made by participating in Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) meetings, including an annual HEAL investigators meeting in the D.C. area, as well as other activities.\r\nIn addition, travel to attend two, one-and-a-half-day PRISM/Collaboratory program meetings in the first year and an annual meeting in subsequent years in the greater Washington D.C. area is expected.\r\nDiversity:\r\nIn addition to scientific diversity, applicants should strive to incorporate diversity in their team development plan. Research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. There are many benefits that flow from a diverse NIH-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust. In spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. NIH encourages institutions to diversify their student and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences. Please refer to Notice of NIH\'s Interest in Diversity NOT-OD-20-031 for more details.\r\nFor the purpose of this FOA, we define ""embedded pragmatic clinical trial"" and ""implementation research,"" as follows:\r\nEmbedded pragmatic clinical trials are conducted within a health care delivery system that will oversee delivery of care (which may be provided in traditional or non-traditional health care settings including but not limited to clinics, hospitals, mobile care units, community centers, etc.), and are “primarily designed to determine the effects of an intervention under the usual conditions in which it will be applied,” which is in contrast with explanatory trials that are “primarily designed to determine the effects of an intervention under ideal circumstances” (http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h2147). There are “three key attributes of pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs): (1) an intent to inform decision-makers (patients, clinicians, administrators, and policy-makers), as opposed to elucidating a biological or social mechanism; (2) an intent to enroll a population relevant to the decision in practice and representative of the patients or populations and clinical settings for whom the decision is relevant; and (3) either an intent to (a) streamline procedures and data collection so that the trial can focus on adequate power for informing the clinical and policy decisions targeted by the trial or (b) measure a broad range of outcomes” (http://rethinkingclinicaltrials.org/chapters/pragmatic-clinical-trial/what-is-a-pragmatic-clinical-trial-2/).\r\nImplementation research seeks to understand the behavior of practitioners and support staff, organizations, community and family members, and policymakers in context as key influences on the adoption, implementation, and sustainability of evidence-based health interventions and guidelines (e.g., Community Guide to Preventive Services, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and clinical and professional societies\' recommendations and guidelines). Implementation research studies should not assume that effective interventions can be integrated into any service setting and for consumer groups and populations without attention to local context, nor that a unidirectional flow of information (e.g., publishing a recommendation, trial, or guideline) is sufficient to achieve practice change. Additional information on implementation research, including frameworks for implementation and hybrid effectiveness-implementation research is available at: https://rethinkingclinicaltrials.org/chapters/dissemination/dissemination-implementation-top/dissemination-and-implementation-frameworks/\r\nThe awards supported by this initiative will utilize the existing coordinating center of the PRISM Program, which leverages the infrastructure of the NIH Health Care Systems (HCS) Research Collaboratory, now known as the Pragmatic Trials Collaboratory. The overall goal of the Collaboratory program is to strengthen the national capacity to implement cost-effective large-scale research studies that engage health care providers and delivery systems and patients as research partners. The NIH HCS Research Collaboratory Program established a Coordinating Center (CC) led by Duke University in 2012 (http://rethinkingclinicaltrials.org/about-nih-collaboratory/) that is providing national leadership and technical expertise. In 2019, the HEAL Initiative supported the PRISM Program, which expands the activities of the CC to support the PRISM awards. Awardees from this FOA will work with the NIH and CC to both plan and conduct their pragmatic or implementation trial.\r\nThe PRISM program encourages sharing of resources with broad availability of policies, practices, materials, and tools to facilitate collaboration, reuse, and replication. In addition, the PRISM program encourages sharing of study data from projects in a timely manner with appropriate privacy and confidentiality protections, in accordance with the Data Sharing Policy developed by the Steering Committee (https://dcricollab.dcri.duke.edu/sites/NIHKR/KR/Collaboratory.DataSharingPolicy_June232014.pdf). Thus, the HCS Research Collaboratory program requires awardees to implement a Resources and Data Sharing Plan consistent with achieving these program goals.\r\nCommon Data Elements (CDEs)\r\nThe HEAL Clinical Pain Common Data Element (CDE) Initiative provides an unprecedented opportunity for the pain research community to access quality and meaningful data across pain conditions, diverse populations, and multiple interventions. The HEAL CDE initiative aims to facilitate cross-study comparisons, improve interpretability of findings for patient-reported outcomes, and improve the ability to compare results across trials to quantify the impact of interventions. For studies involving human subjects, projects will be required to use the HEAL Clinical Pain Core CDEs which include measures within nine pain domains and are specific to either adult or pediatric populations and acute or chronic pain conditions. The domains include pain intensity, pain interference, physical functioning/quality of life, sleep, pain catastrophizing, depression, anxiety, treatment satisfaction, and a substance use screener (HEAL CDE Program). Studies that use additional pain screening tools must select from a comprehensive set coded through HEAL or submit their tools for coding to comply with HEAL pain data harmonization. Any outcome measures specific to clinical pain should be validated measures appropriate for the pain condition.\r\nResearch Objectives\r\nThis FOA solicits applications for UG3/UH3 exploratory/developmental phased award cooperative agreements for projects including efficient, pragmatic, implementation, or hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials addressing chronic pain management in rural or remote populations. Projects addressing multiple levels of NIMHD’s research framework are encouraged.\r\nApplications must specify one or more health care systems (HCS) that will oversee delivery of care. There must be two or more sites within the HCS, or multiple HCS to assure inclusivity and sufficient sample size. Sites may include (but are not limited to) rural hospitals, clinics, provider offices, pharmacies, mobile health units or home health providers. HCS partners include but are not limited to large health care systems, small and rural hospitals, Critical Access Hospitals, Rural Health Clinics, Tribal clinics and hospitals, Federally Qualified Health Centers and Indian Health Service (IHS) federally operated healthcare facilities, as well as visiting nurse services/home health agencies. HCS may also include local primary health care providers (including physician, doctor of osteopathy, dentist, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, nurse-midwife, nurse anesthetist, clinical nurse specialist, emergency medical service providers, etc.) at one or more sites of care. For effectiveness studies, the HCS should be large enough to yield sufficient participants to ensure powering the trial design. The design of the proposed project should maximize external validity of the study while maintaining rigor, by testing generalizability, feasibility, and sustainability of findings across rural and/or remote health care settings and diverse staff and patient populations.\r\nIn the UG3 planning phase, one or more additional community-based partners will be identified to participate in the proposed trial. Community partner(s) should be located in the rural or remote community (as described in Part 2, Section I. Background) and might be a community organization, faith-based organization, community health worker, local library, school, local patient or consumer advocacy group, community champion, local group representing populations that experience health disparities, and/or other relevant community stakeholder group. Other potential partners with experience working with rural clinical sites include Area Health Education Centers, Primary Care Associations, State Rural Health Associations, State Offices of Rural Health, Medicare Quality Improvement Organizations. The community-based partner(s) should be fully engaged in the research process from planning through implementation and evaluation.\r\nThe research application should specify the type of proposed research, whether pragmatic, implementation, or hybrid effectiveness-implementation, and must meet all the following criteria:\r\n<ol><li>The project must test an intervention or coordinate several interventions (which can be treatments, preventive actions, or organizational changes) that are robust, apply broadly to pain patient populations, and can be implemented in rural and remote areas, with the broad goal of determining whether the intervention(s) improves pain outcomes/management and adds value to the utilization of the nation’s health care resources.</li><li>The results of the question being tested will have a significant impact on pain management in rural and/or remote populations at the individual or systems level.</li><li>The intervention(s) must be well-characterized and available such that it could be reliably delivered by clinical providers and/or HCS. If an intervention includes a drug, biologic, or medical device, it must be a legally marketed drug, biologic, or medical device in the US, and used as approved/cleared for use by the Food and Drug Administration.</li><li>The intervention(s) must be reasonably simple and not require a complex structure for implementation or monitoring.</li><li>As in routine practice, the project must allow for interventions to be implemented with flexibility and by appropriate practitioners.</li><li>The project outcome measure(s) must be clinically meaningful and important to stakeholders including patients, providers, health care systems, and policy makers. Clinical outcome measures must be defined at the patient, provider, and/or system level. Additional outcome measures, such as use of health care services or medications and other resources may be included.</li><li>The project design must incorporate rigorous controls, prospectively identified, preferably by randomization. The design may incorporate alternative randomization approaches, such as by cluster or timing of implementation. If another method is used to generate the comparison group, perhaps by staged assignment or staged implementation of the intervention, it should provide comparable rigor and the choice should be justified in the application. More than one health care system partner may be needed to enroll sufficient participants for a rigorous study.</li><li>Proposed analytic plans for projects that proposed cluster-randomized trials must address adequacy of sample size and study power and employ analytic strategies relevant for such pragmatic trial designs. Applicants are strongly encouraged to consult Collaboratory Biostatistical Guidance documents (http://sites.duke.edu/rethinkingclinicaltrials/biostatistical-guidance-documents/) when developing pragmatic trial analytic plans.</li><li>The project must enroll patients based on broad eligibility criteria to maximize diversity and minimize intentional or unintentional exclusions based on risk, age, health literacy, demographics, or expected adherence. Projects with a focus on NIH-designated disparity populations in rural and remote areas are encouraged.</li></ol>Studies addressing effectiveness must include:\r\n<ul><li>Sufficient HCS partners or sites to realistically enroll a sample to reach 90% power.</li></ul>Implementation trials must include:\r\n<ul><li>Sufficient evidence for the proposed intervention to justify implementation or de-implementation or the need for intervention adaptation. A strategy to de-implement care is proposed for low-value interventions where there is evidence of no benefit or there is more harm than benefit for patients.</li><li>Outcomes focused on implementation that are most likely at a system or individual provider level. Patient-level implementation outcomes may be possible if focused on the use of the targeted intervention.</li><li>A conceptual model and theoretical justification of the proposed study design and variables tested with a well-defined strategy and reasonable readiness to adopt if primary outcome is met.</li></ul>Partnerships with health care delivery systems, providers, and community-based organizations will be critical in conducting this work. Applicants should name the health care system, describe the role of the health care system, the number of sites available, and indicate the rationale for selecting this health care system or organization. Evidence of support and commitment to the project should be included, such as letters of support, budgets for appropriate providers or coordinators, etc. Applicants should NOT name the community-based partner(s) or organization(s), but should describe the role of the community-based partner(s) and the criteria for selection. Budgets for the community-based partner(s) should be included in the UH3 phase. Applicants, who may be from academic institutions or other organizations, should describe experience in successful conduct of clinical or implementation research in partnerships with health care systems.\r\nThese projects will be funded as phased awards. Only UG3 projects with a planned pilot may request 2 years for the planning phase with up to 3 years for the UH3 implementation phase; all other projects may request 1 year for the UG3 phase with up to 4 years for the UH3 phase. Applications proposing a 2-year UG3 Phase must propose and justify the need for a pilot study that will inform the design of the UH3 Phase. Activities in both phases will depend on the specific study (e.g., disease domains, types of interventions, experimental design, randomization strategy, and proposed outcome measures).\r\nDuring the UG3 or planning phase, activities will generally include but will not be limited to the following:\r\n<ol><li>Identify project staff that will participate in the PRISM/Collaboratory Work Groups (see Section I.5 Additional Information https://rethinkingclinicaltrials.org/cores-and-working-groups/), which will develop guidelines and practices to be implemented across projects.</li><li>Work with the Collaboratory to implement approved guidelines and practices for electronic data extraction and quality control methods and tools, as well as for electronic data sharing, when feasible. In the planning phase, this will include developing and validating all electronic data methods and tools within the health care system needed for the project (e.g., electronic health records, electronic methods for patient identification and outcomes assessment, patient reported data, biospecimens, images, high-throughput genomic data, family history data, data abstraction and survey instruments) and complete quality control testing at all sites. If multiple health care systems are included, there may be multiple electronic health record systems from which data need to be collected.</li><li>Finalize the intervention, including materials and training plans for sites.</li><li>Assess adequacy and finalize clinically relevant outcome measures with other Collaboratory investigators. Awarded applicants will work with other Collaboratory investigators and NIH to identify HEAL Core Measures (pain severity, pain interference, and pain functioning, as well as others); and will work with the CC and NIH to develop metrics for resource utilization for planning and implementing Collaboratory pragmatic trials. If an award is made, NIH and CC staff will work with the Program Directors/Principal Investigators to facilitate coordination among projects.</li><li>Refine estimates of requirements with guidance from NIH and the CC for sample size, numbers of sites, site to site heterogeneity, and implementation timetable based on data derived from the partnering HCS.</li><li>Identify at least one additional community-based partner (not specified in the application) and develop a detailed community partner engagement plan that outlines planned collaborations with community-based study-relevant organizations, patients with lived experience in the community, local patient or consumer advocacy groups, community champions, groups representing populations that experience health disparities, community-based organizations, faith-based organizations and/or other relevant community stakeholder groups. The community engagement plan should:\r\n<ol><li>Describe patient engagement activities and methods to monitor and evaluate outcomes related to engagement</li><li>Describe the roles of community partners from planning through implementation and evaluation of the study</li><li>Describe the characteristics of desirable community partners</li><li>Include linguistic and cultural competence strategies to enable recruitment and retention of populations that experience health disparities</li></ol></li><li>Include resources to compensate community partners and support and sustain community engagement.</li><li>Identity barriers to implementation and patient/provider/community preferences for implementation. Develop detailed plans to address barriers and preferences including participation of community partners in planning and implementation. Examples of issue that may need to be addressed include (but are not limited to) infrastructure needs such as internet or cellular access, appropriate equipment to implement the intervention and monitor patients, transportation issues, etc.</li><li>Develop detailed plans for site implementation, including site staff, method of identification, randomization (as applicable) and participant recruitment and acquisition and administration/implementation of the intervention if applicable. The plans should include site staff training and support in conducting activities needed for implementation, keeping in mind that community partners may have limited experience with research and its activities.</li><li>Put strategies in place should enrollment or retention not meet specified metrics.</li><li>Address all ethical issues and issues related to human subject safety oversight for the project, including the development of informed consent documents or opt-out consent if applicable, and finalize the site of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) review. Applicants must propose a single IRB approach for trial oversight to facilitate both appropriate and timely study implementation, unless review by the proposed single IRB would be prohibited by a federal, Tribal, or state law, regulation, or policy. Address all potential regulatory elements of the proposed trial (if applicable).</li><li>Develop a detailed budget for conduct and completion of the project, including preparation of a final study report. Budget must include appropriate compensation for community-based partners. Finalize detailed plans for data coordination and quality control for the UH3 phase. The CC will not provide these functions for individual projects. Data coordinating activities for individual projects must be budgeted as part of the UH3 budget. The budget should include any costs for data sharing to meet HEAL requirements (see section IV. 2. Resource Sharing). Data sharing activities with the CC do not require separate budgets.</li></ol>Project Implementation Phase (UH3): The objective of the two-to-four-year UH3 implementation phase is to conduct the project in accordance with activities planned in the UG3 phase. Implementation activities will depend upon the study, but in general the following goals should be achieved:\r\n<ul><li>Each project is expected to implement all aspects of the proposed pragmatic trial or implementation research study – including the identification and recruitment of proposed sample sizes of patients, practice sites, and clinicians, as well as the execution of the intervention and its implementation, and the assessment of outcomes.</li><li>Each project is expected to provide complete assessment of all issues related to patient, clinician, and site identification, as well as electronic health record (EHR) tools used in these steps.</li><li>Each project is expected to provide definitive information about the execution of the intervention at all sites.</li><li>Each project is encouraged to assess fidelity to the intervention, when possible, and describe if any efforts will be made to address poor or differential fidelity across sites or study arms.</li><li>Each project is to provide detailed and definitive testing of the validity of methods used for monitoring and outcome assessment.</li></ul>For Pragmatic Trials that aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention Design, Analysis, and Sample Size for Intervention Studies that Assign and/or Deliver Interventions in Groups or Clusters\r\nSpecial research design and method for analysis and sample size are needed in the following conditions:\r\n<ul><li>Participants are assigned to study arms in groups or clusters (e.g., families, clinics, schools, worksites, communities, counties, states) and observations taken on individual participants are analyzed for intervention effects.\r\n<ul><li>Appropriate intervention study designs include but are not limited to a parallel group- or cluster-randomized trial, a stepped-wedge group- or cluster-randomized trial, a rigorous quasi-experimental design such as group- or cluster-level regression discontinuity design or interrupted time-series design, or a rigorous alternative.</li></ul></li><li>Participants are assigned individually to study arms but receive at least some of their intervention in a group (in-person or virtual) or through a shared facilitator or provider.\r\n<ul><li>Appropriate study designs include an individually randomized group treatment trial, a rigorous quasi-experimental design, such as an individual-level regression discontinuity design, or a rigorous alternative.</li></ul></li></ul>Methods consistent with plans for assignment of participants and delivery of interventions should be documented in the application. Additional information and examples are available at https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov\r\nMilestones and UG3/UH3 TransitionUtilization of milestones is a key characteristic of this FOA. A milestone is defined as a scheduled event in the project timeline, signifying the completion of a major project stage or activity. This FOA will utilize a two-phase, milestone-driven cooperative agreement (UG3/UH3) mechanism consisting of a start-up phase of one or two years (UG3) and a full enrollment and clinical or implementation trial execution phase (UH3). UG3 projects with a planned pilot may request 2 years for the planning phase, all other projects may request 1 year. Projects must include well-defined milestones for the planning phase (UG3) and annual milestones for the implementation phase (UH3). It is understood that the proposed milestones for the UH3 phase will be revised as activities in the UG3 phase progress. In the event of an award, the PD/PI and NIH staff will negotiate a final list of milestones for each year of support. Milestones for transition to the UH3 phase should be quantitative and support a go/no-go decision.\r\nAt the completion of the UG3 planning phase, the applicant will be required to submit a detailed transition request for the UH3 Project implementation phase. UH3 transition requests will undergo an administrative review to determine whether the project will be awarded for the implementation phase (UH3).\r\n<ul><li>All community-based partners should be named prior to the end of the UG3 award.</li><li>All regulatory approvals should be obtained prior to the end of the UG3 award.</li><li>Training of intervention providers, comparison group providers, or other resources should be planned at the start of the UH3 award to allow for the successful launch and execution of the proposed pragmatic trial or implementation study in the UH3 phase.</li></ul>Applicants should understand that initial funding of the UG3 phase does not guarantee support of the UH3 phase and transition to the UH3 phase of the project will occur only if an administrative review process recommends that the UG3 planning milestones have been successfully met, that the UH3 phase can proceed with confidence of success, and that there is an availability of funds. Continuation of the award is conditional upon satisfactory progress, including satisfactory enrollment. If, at any time, recruitment falls significantly below the projected milestones for recruitment, the NIH will 1.) implement a corrective action plan and 2.) if necessary, consider ending support and negotiating an orderly phase-out of the award. NIH retains, as an option, periodic external peer review of progress through existing PRISM, NIH Pragmatic Trials Collaboratory and/or HEAL external advisors. NIH staff will closely monitor progress at all stages, milestones, accrual instances, and safety levels.\r\nResearch Areas of Interest\r\nApplicants must propose a pragmatic or implementation trial to address one or more critical research questions important for chronic pain management in rural or remote populations.\r\nApplications submitted in response to this FOA are strongly encouraged to: 1) include multi-level interventions with systemic implementation strategies that are scalable and conducive to long-term sustainability (beyond the term of award) and can be rapidly implemented in rural and remote healthcare systems; 2) incorporate efficiencies and utilize existing resources (e.g., NCATS CTSAs, practice-based research networks, electronic health records, administrative databases and/or patient registries, rural health research centers) to increase the efficiency of participant enrollment, retention, and data collection; 3) consider subpopulation analysis to determine which interventions work best for specific population and/or cultural groups (e.g., American Indians/Alaska Natives, Hispanics or Latinos, Pacific Islanders, Veterans, occupations such as mining, agriculture, forestry, etc.) including medically underserved, un- and under-insured, Medicare- or Medicaid-eligible populations, and underrepresented groups, with the intent to focus on reduction of health disparities; and 4) assess social determinants of health using measures available in the Social Determinants of Health Collection of the PhenX Toolkit (www.phenxtoolkit.org) or other widely adopted measures, as appropriate. Depending on study design and preference of the rural community, a plan to make the intervention available to all participants after completion of the trial should be considered. Applicants are encouraged to collect data on patient experiences that may affect their chronic pain including Veteran status, occupation, etc.\r\nExamples of interventions and settings include but are not limited to:\r\n<ul><li>Interventions in rural and/or remote health care settings, including primary care (offices, clinics, Rural Health Clinics, Community Health Centers, urgent care, dentist office, home health agency, etc.), acute care (emergency rooms, small and rural hospitals, Critical Access Hospitals, surgical centers, etc.), and other traditional and non-traditional health care settings where pain management disparities are well documented.</li><li>Interventions that address a gap in access to non-opioid pain management for rural and/or remote populations (e.g., mobile interventions, telehealth options, delivery of select services in community settings, non-opioid medications, brief training followed by self-care, etc.).</li><li>Non-opioid pain interventions including but not limited to non-opioid medications, self-care or self-management techniques, non-pharmacologic treatments, physical therapy, and/or training in interventions followed by home practice.</li><li>Interventions that address equity in decision-making for pain assessment, management, and follow up (e.g., assessment of preferences for pain care, use of semi-structured interviews to assess and mitigate bias).</li><li>Evidence-based interventions for effective practices for chronic pain management that have not been implemented or tested in rural or remote populations either on their own or in combination with other tested interventions or novel interventions with evidence of efficacy.</li></ul>The following list provides examples of some of the potential research topics that might be addressed by such trials:\r\n<ul><li>Studies focused on improving access to specialty pain management and non-pharmacological interventions.

Examples include but are not limited to severe dental/orofacial pain resulting in repeated ER/Urgent Care visits for pain management or pain resulting from a severe injury that requires additional treatment such as physical therapy or surgery.</li></ul>Specific examples of pain conditions of interest include but are not limited to the following:\r\n<ul><li>Migraines and other chronic headaches</li><li>Pain from arthritis</li><li>Low back pain</li><li>Pain from injuries requiring health care intervention</li><li>Perioperative pain</li><li>Dental/orofacial pain</li><li>Gynecological pain</li><li>Visceral pain</li><li>Neuropathies and neuropathic pain</li><li>Cancer pain or chronic pain in cancer survivors</li><li>Pain in one or multiple chronic conditions such as lupus, fibromyalgia, sickle cell disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease, etc.</li></ul>It is expected that the pragmatic, implementation, or hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials supported under this RFA will recruit women in sufficient numbers to determine sex/gender-specific responses as well as sex/gender differences in trial outcomes. These comparisons have significant clinical relevance given the higher prevalence of pain in women. Studies should, as appropriate, enroll both sexes to better understand the influence of sex/gender as a variable.\r\nTypes of Studies Responsive to this FOA\r\nThe following types of studies are responsive to this FOA:\r\n<ul><li>Pragmatic, implementation, or hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials</li><li>Adapting, adopting and/or testing of methods for prevention and management of chronic pain and for management of acute pain if the acute pain requires the intervention of a health care provider for management (e.g., acute dental/orofacial pain or acute low back pain) and is likely to recur, become chronic, or escalate to a more serious complication if not managed appropriately.</li></ul>Types of Clinical Trials Not Responsive to this FOA\r\nThe following types of clinical trials are not responsive to this FOA and applications proposing such activities will be deemed non-responsive and will not be reviewed:\r\n<ul><li>Studies that do not include human subjects</li><li>Studies that propose to conduct research in animals or in vitro studies</li><li>Phase I (first-in-human) trials whether single or multi-site</li><li>Studies to assess initial feasibility of an intervention</li><li>Studies to understand the mechanism of the intervention that do not include evaluation of health outcomes</li><li>FDA-regulated drug, biologic, or device trial</li><li>Studies that do not focus on populations residing in rural or remote settings as defined above in Part 2, Section I.</li><li>Secondary data analysis</li><li>Studies that are only observational</li></ul>IC-Specific Areas of Interest\r\nIn addition to the above description of the scientific objectives, resources communicating scientific interests of selected NIH Institutes, Centers, and Offices (ICOs) are summarized below. Applicants are encouraged to contact the Scientific/Research contact of the intended I/C to ensure that the aims of the proposed project are consistent with the ICO mission.\r\nNational Institute of Nursing Research (NINR)\r\nThe National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR) supports research to solve pressing health challenges and inform practice and policy - optimizing health and advancing health equity into the future. NINR discovers solutions to health challenges through the lenses of health equity, social determinants of health, population and community health, prevention and health promotion, and systems and models of care. Drawing on the strengths of nursing’s holistic, contextualized perspective, core values, and broad reach, NINR funds multilevel and cross-sectoral research that examines the factors that impact health across the many settings in which nurses work, including homes, schools, workplaces, clinics, justice settings, and the community.\r\nIn the context of this FOA, NINR’s interests include but are not limited to the following topics:\r\n<ul><li>Studies of prevention and management of chronic pain in rural settings that address health-related social risk factors and social needs within the context of clinical practice and health care delivery</li><li>Implementation studies that incorporate attention to social determinants of health that affect pain management options and outcomes</li><li>Research that identifies and addresses access to quality care, and structural barriers impacting health outcomes, health seeking behaviors, and patient-provider interactions</li><li>Projects focused on improving the health of underserved, uninsured, and under-insured rural and remote populations</li><li>Multidisciplinary, multi-level interventions or multi-component delivery models that fully engage stakeholders and the rural communities where they serve</li><li>Studies that address clinical and organizational challenges to delivery of evidence-based, quality care for chronic pain, especially those studies that bridge clinical and community care services with social factors and health care needs.</li></ul>National Institute on Aging (NIA)\r\nNIA is interested in applications that focus on adults in middle age and late life with acute and chronic pain conditions. NIA is particularly interested in management of pain in the setting of multiple chronic conditions, polypharmacy, socioeconomic deprivation, and physical functional and cognitive impairment. NIA is especially interested in improving health equity of aging populations suffering with pain. As such, applicants are encouraged to propose research that will investigate or address causal drivers and moderators of disparities in pain experience and pain management operating at multiple levels of analysis and domains of influence and across the lifespan. NIA encourages projects addressing priorities outlined in the NIA Health Disparities Research Framework.\r\nApplications that propose behavioral interventions are encouraged to use the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development, focusing on Stage IV and Stage V. For example, the UG3 Phase may include Stage IV studies focused on establishing necessary relationships in rural communities to establish the effectiveness of efficacious simple interventions (e.g., simple “default” or “nudge” interventions, or technology-based interventions that require no training to administer), and the UH3 Phase may include hybrid Stage IV/Stage V studies that examine the Stage IV effectiveness of these interventions in combination with Stage V research examining the mechanisms of action of different implementation strategies.\r\nNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)\r\nNIAAA has particular interest in applications examining the use of alcohol to self-medicate chronic pain and how alcohol use impacts implementation of proposed interventions to treat chronic pain. Specific considerations relevant to alcohol include but are not limited to: assessment, across healthcare settings, of alcohol use; co-use of alcohol and opioids to self-medicate chronic pain; ability of interventions to reduce alcohol consumption; incorporation of alcohol-related information into patient, provider, family, and community education materials; and differential effects or impacts of alcohol on chronic pain across health disparity populations.\r\nNational Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS)\r\nThe mission of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) is to support research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases. In the context of this FOA, the NIAMS is interested in applications that support the ""real world"" implementation of effective, evidence-based interventions to manage pain in individuals from rural and remote areas with emphasis on pain assessment, treatment, and management in the NIAMS mission-relevant disease areas. Research in community health care settings is particularly encouraged. Note, applications focusing on chronic low back pain (cLBP) will be expected to align with the Back Pain Consortium (BACPAC) Research Program definition of cLBP and collect the BACPAC minimum data set as appropriate. Applicants are encouraged to discuss potential applications with the appropriate NIAMS program director.\r\nEunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)\r\nThe Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is particularly interested in applications that address implementation of evidence-based non-opioid interventions for chronic pain management in rural and remote populations relevant to (a) women with endometriosis, pelvic pain, vulvodynia/vestibulodynia, dysmenorrhea, and other gynecologic pain syndromes, and (b) children, women of reproductive age, pregnant and lactating individuals, people with intellectual and physical disabilities, and health disparity populations (i.e. racial/ethnic groups, sexual and gender minorities, underserved rural and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations).\r\nNational Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA)\r\nNIDA is interested in pragmatic, implementation or hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials that concurrently address chronic pain management and reductions in opioid misuse or opioid use disorder (OUD) in rural communities. For the purposes of this RFA, opioid misuse is defined as taking a medication in a manner or dose other than prescribed; taking someone else’s prescription, even if for a legitimate medical complaint such as pain; or taking a medication to feel euphoria (i.e., to get high). For the purposes of this RFA, the DSM-5 identifies OUD as a problematic pattern of opioid use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress. OUD severity can range from mild (2-3 symptoms), to moderate (4-5 symptoms) and severe (6 or more symptoms). Individuals who are in OUD recovery can also be included in these studies. Of importance, tolerance and withdrawal symptoms represent iatrogenic consequences of chronic opioid consumption and do not meet DSM criteria for mild OUD. Applicants who are interested in measuring reductions in misuse behaviors and/or OUD are encouraged to collect the IMPOWR CDEs and share data with the IMPOWR network.\r\nNational Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)\r\nIn addition to the Research Areas of Interest delineated above, this FOA encourages applications that leverage existing resources and/or identify unique challenges in rural communities affected by the opioid epidemic. NIDCR is interested in clinical trials aimed at reducing the burden of pain in individuals living in rural areas and associated with acute and chronic oral and craniofacial diseases and conditions including temporomandibular disorders (TMD), trigeminal neuropathies, burning mouth syndrome, oral cancer pain, dental/orofacial pain and other conditions.

Applicants should describe how the results of the question being tested will have a significant impact on pain management in rural and/or remote populations at an individual or systems level. The intervention should be clearly described, well-characterized and available such that it could be reliably delivered by clinical providers or HCSs. The intervention should be reasonably simple and not require a complex structure for implementation or monitoring. The application should describe planned implementation flexibilities including implementation by appropriate providers.\r\nTo clearly distinguish between the two phases, applicants should specify separate UG3 and UH3 information in each subsection (Specific Aims and Research Strategy) of the PHS 398 Research Plan as appropriate. Activities in both phases will depend on the specific study (e.g., specific pain population, types of interventions, experimental design, randomization strategy and proposed outcome measures). In preparing the application, investigators should consider the fact that applications will be assigned a single impact score for both UG3 and UH3 phases.\r\nSpecific Aims: Applicants should address the scientific questions to be answered: what specifically will be done during the proposed funding periods, and what is the impact of addressing the research question on public health. Specific aims should be scientifically appropriate for the distinct phases of the project. Include separate aims, on one page, for both the UG3 and UH3 phase, and clearly label them as UG3 specific aims and UH3 specific aims.\r\nResearch Strategy: Within the Research Strategy, applicants should first describe the UG3 Phase and then the UH3 Phase. The Research Strategy section should have a clear demarcation of the UG3 and UH3 phases of the application. It is not necessary to repeat background information or details of methods in the UH3 portion that were provided in the UG3 portion. Applications proposing a two-year UG3 Phase must propose and justify the need for a pilot study that will inform the design of the UH3 Phase.

Applicants should describe how the results of the question being tested will have a significant impact on pain management in rural and/or remote populations at an individual or systems level. The intervention should be clearly described, well-characterized and available such that it could be reliably delivered by clinical providers or HCSs. The intervention should be reasonably simple and not require a complex structure for implementation or monitoring. The application should describe planned implementation flexibilities including implementation by appropriate providers.\r\nClinically meaningful outcome measures that are important to stakeholders should be described. The level (patient, provider and/or system level) of the outcome measures should be defined. If the study is not randomized, the rigor of the planned controls and justification for the choice of control should be described. All applications should include a clear description of the analytic plan that is appropriate to the type of study (pragmatic, implementation or hybrid effectiveness/implementation). If the project proposes a cluster-randomized trial, explanation of the adequacy of the sample size and study are needed, as well as the planned analytic strategy.\r\nInvestigators are encouraged to describe how the approaches, measures, designs, and outcomes proposed are pragmatic or utilize implementation research methods.\r\nIf the project proposes to implement evidence-based guidelines, applicants are encouraged to describe the quality and level of evidence for the treatments that will be implemented from the guidelines.\r\nThe application should describe the health care system(s) and the investigative team\'s experience conducting pragmatic, implementation, or hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials within health care systems. In general, all studies must use at least one HCS for implementation, which is identified in the application. Applications proposing effectiveness outcomes should include a sufficient number of participating HCS (at least one) and sites (more than one) to allow for enrollment of participants to allow for a fully powered assessment of effectiveness. The application must provide a rationale for the HCS selected for the project and provide a description of the infrastructure and expertise to implement the proposed trial within all proposed HCSs. Additional community partnerships will be developed in the UG3 phase. A description of the role of the community partner, criteria for selecting a community partner, and plans for developing the partnership in the UG3 phase should be included.\r\nBoth the UG3 and the UH3 phases of the Research Strategy must include a summary of the proposed Milestones Plan that is a required Other Clinical Trial-related attachment. The summary should describe the key milestones (e.g., training of study personnel, implementation of EHR and other data collection methods, IRB approval for each site, enrollment targets by gender/race/ethnicity, etc.) that need to be met for each phase of the application (UG3 and UH3) to ensure its success; the methods that will be used to reach the milestones; and a timetable identifying when each of these key milestones will be met. The proposed milestones will be reviewed by the NIH program staff based on recommendations from the peer review panels, and final milestones will be agreed upon and included in the terms of award. Milestones may be revised in the UG3 phase by agreement of the investigators and NIH program staff.\r\nPRISM/Collaboratory Work Groups include participation by individuals from all funded projects, the CC, and the NIH. Applicants should describe how project personnel would participate in the PRISM/Collaboratory Work Groups ([Electronic Health Records, Regulatory /Ethics, Biostatistics &amp; Study Design, Health Care Systems Interactions, Implementation Science (if applicable), Health Equity, and Patient Reported Outcomes http://rethinkingclinicaltrials.org/cores-and-working-groups/].

Consistent with the HEAL Initiative Public Access and Data Sharing Policy (https://heal.nih.gov/about/public-access-data), all applications, regardless of the amount of direct costs requested for any one year, are required to include a Data Management and Sharing Plan, outlining how scientific data and any accompanying metadata will be managed and shared. The plan should describe data types, file formats, submission timelines, and standards used in collecting or processing the data. Data generated by HEAL Initiative-funded projects must be submitted to study-appropriate domain-specific or generalist repositories in consultation with the HEAL Data Stewardship Group to ensure the data is accessible via the HEAL Initiative Data Ecosystem. Guidelines for complying with the HEAL Public Access and Data Sharing Policy can be found at https://heal.nih.gov/data/complying-heal-data-sharing-policy. Resources and tools to assist with data related activities can be found at https://www.healdatafair.org/.\r\nTo maximize discoverability and value of HEAL datasets and studies and facilitate data integration and collaboration, applications submitted in response to this FOA are strongly encouraged to incorporate standards and resources where applicable:\r\n<ul><li>Applicants are encouraged to ensure that data collected by the study conform to Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles.</li><li>Applicants are specifically encouraged to incorporate into their planning an alignment with the guidelines, principles, and recommendations developed by the HEAL Data Ecosystem, including but not limited to preparing data to store in selected specified repositories, applying minimal metadata standards, and using core HEAL Clinical Data Elements (CDEs) (https://heal.nih.gov/data/common-data-elements) and other necessary requirements to prepare data to connect to the HEAL Data Ecosystem.</li><li>All new HEAL clinical pain studies are required to submit their case-report forms/questionnaires to the HEAL Clinical Data Elements (CDE) Program. The program will create the CDE files containing standardized variable names, responses, coding, and other information. The program will also format the case-report forms in a standardized way that is compliant with accessibility standards under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C § 794 (d)), which “require[s] Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities.” HEAL Initiative clinical studies that are using copyrighted questionnaires are required to obtain licenses for use prior to initiating data collection. Licenses must be shared with the HEAL CDE team and the program officer prior to use of copyrighted materials. For additional information, visit the HEAL CDE Program.</li><li>To the extent possible, HEAL awardees are expected to integrate broad data sharing consent language into their informed consent forms and align study consent language with data access and re-use requirements as defined by repository HEAL investigators select to store their HEAL data long-term.</li></ul>The NIH notices referenced below provide additional NIH guidance that should be considered in developing a strong data management and sharing plan. The list is instructive but not comprehensive.\r\n<ul><li>Elements of an NIH Data Management and Sharing Plan (NOT-OD-21-014)</li><li>NIH has provided guidance around selecting a repository for data generated by NIH-supported research and has developed desirable characteristics for all data repositories (NOT-OD-21-016).</li><li>NIH encourages the use of data standards including the PhenX Toolkit (www.phenxtoolkit.org) (for example, see NOT-DA-12-008, NOT-MH-15-009).</li><li>Data should be organized according to a standard model that is widely accepted within the field. An example for the clinical research studies would be the OMOP Common Data Model, which has also been successfully adapted for use with observational (including survey) studies more generally. In addition, the HL7 FHIR® (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard (NOT-OD-19-122) may facilitate the flow of data with EHR-based datasets, tools, and applications.</li><li>NIH encourages clinical research programs and researchers to adopt and use the standardized set of data classes, data elements, and associated vocabulary standards specified in the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) standards, as they are applicable (NOT-OD-20-146). Use of the USCDI can complement the FHIR® standard and enable researchers to leverage structured EHR data for research and enable discovery. In addition to USCDI, OMOP, and FHIR standards for enhanced interoperability, investigators and data centers should align their data collection and management practices with recommended guidance emerging from the HEAL CDE and Data Ecosystem programs.</li></ul>Awardees conducting research that includes collection of genomic data should incorporate requirements under the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy (NOT-OD-14-124, NOT-OD-15-086).\r\nLetters of Support\r\nApplications must include a strong letter of support from each of the HCS partners named in the application that relates their commitment to the proposed research and outlines how the project fits with organizational priorities, and the commitment of their staff to the project.

"{'Ever since Medicare first proposed significant cuts to specialty providers in order to pay for an increase to physician payment for evaluation and management services, the therapy community including physical, occupational and speech therapists has been working with lawmakers in Congress to reverse the unfair and steep level of payment cuts levied on the specialty provider community.\r\nIn anticipation of the Medicare payment rules for 2022, specialty care providers again asked Congress\xa0for assistance in preventing destabilizing Medicare policies. Now that the\xa0Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) Proposed Rule for CY2022\xa0rule is out, and again includes deep cuts to physical therapy, we need congressional help to avert these dangerous cuts.\r\nDespite broad opposition from stakeholders, the proposed PFS rule includes plans to impose a 3.5 percent cut to physical and occupational therapists in 2022. Taken together with the compounding impact of successive cuts to our specialty, physical and occupational therapists will eventually face a steep 9 percent payment cut by 2024, some of the largest cuts planned for the Medicare program.\xa0\r\nAs more\xa0older\xa0Americans\xa0who depend on Medicare\xa0are becoming dependent on specialty care services, these continued cuts threaten the sustainability of Americas shaken health care system and, ultimately, patient access to critical services.\r\nFor millions of patients, physical therapy services are critical for helping individuals recover from serious injury or illness; building strength, balance, and independence; and managing pain without the use of opioids. By creating an individual treatment plan for each patient, physical therapists not only help address patients immediate needs (e.g., joint pain, limited range of motion and mobility), they also amplify the value of care by lowering the risk of more serious conditions.\r\nFor example, physical therapy empowers seniors to regain balance in order to prevent dangerous falls. According to the\xa0latest data\xa0released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in May, falls caused more than 90 percent of the countrys 2.4 million emergency department visits and 700,000 hospitalizations due to unintentional injuries to older adults.\r\nPatient-specific exercise regimens facilitated by trained health care professionals can\xa0significantly reduce seniors risk of a fall. Not only does this help older Americans live longer, healthier lives, it also helps save Medicare money. With the average lifetime costs for a patient experiencing a fall-related hip fracture\xa0topping over $81,000, and the projected\xa0annual cost of treating falls expected to surge past $100 billion\xa0by 2030, fall prevention strategies are desperately needed.\r\nMoreover, physical therapy is a safe, non-addictive pain management approach. Unlike prescription opioids, which simply mask physical discomfort, physical therapy prevents and treats the underlying cause of each patients pain. Since 1999,\xa0over half a million Americans have died due to an opioid overdose, originally driven by an over prescription of these powerful painkillers. While medications may be appropriate for some, physical therapy has shown to be a valuable tool in reducing seniors aches, pains, and inflammation without the risk of addiction, diversion, or overdose.\r\nFinally, physical therapy is well-positioned to help long-haul COVID patients recover from complications related to their disease. Because lengthy hospital stays often cause muscle deterioration, access to therapies to support strength, balance, and mobility is vital to this patient population.\r\nUnfortunately, if the additional cuts proposed by CMS are finalized, it will be harder for Medicare beneficiaries to access the physical therapy services they need to recover.\xa0Last year, Congress acted to avert devastating cuts for 2021 with just days to spare.\xa0We need Congress to again lead the way in addressing these serious threats caused by the current Medicare payment system. Doing so will ensure continued patient access and financial sustainability for Americas specialty healthcare providers.\xa0\r\nNikesh Patel, PT, DPT, is the executive director of the Alliance for Physical Therapy Quality &amp; Innovation.': ""{'PERSON': ['Nikesh Patel', 'PT, DPT'], 'DATE': ['2022', '2024', '1999', '2021', '2030'], 'LOC': ['America'], 'ORG': ['Medicare', 'Congress', 'the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) Proposed Rule for CY2022', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)', 'Alliance for Physical Therapy Quality & Innovation'], 'PROGRAMS': [], 'IMPACT': ['3.5 percent cut to physical and occupational therapists in 2022', 'physical and occupational therapists will eventually face a steep 9 percent payment cut by 2024', 'falls caused more than 90 percent of the countries 2.4 million emergency department visits and 700,000 hospitalizations due to unintentional injuries to older adults', 'average lifetime costs for a patient experiencing a fall-related hip fracture topping over $81,000', 'annual cost of treating falls expected to surge past $100 billion by 2030', 'over half a million Americans have died due to an opioid overdose']}""}"
"{""You're reading Part 2 of The War on Recovery, a yearlong investigation into how the U.S. denies lifesaving medications to people with opioid addiction. Read Part 1.\r\nPart 3 coming March 19\r\nDETROIT Every morning, Rebecca Smith, nursing a surgically repaired knee, carefully walks down the hallway of her brutalist brick apartment building, takes the elevator one floor to the lobby, and negotiates the sharply angled driveway outside. There, she waits for an Uber to take her to the last place she wants to go: her methadone clinic.\r\nIt is her most despised ritual. Smith, 65, is a former medical assistant, a grandmother, and a widow. She has not used illegal drugs in over five years, thanks in large part to methadone, a common medication that is highly effective at treating opioid addiction. But methadone, which once promised Smith freedom from drugs, has made her a prisoner to the drug-treatment system. Like hundreds of thousands of other Americans, she spends each morning journeying to and from her clinic, all so she can wait in line to swallow a small cups worth of medication.\r\nSmiths life has not always revolved around her methadone clinic. Until recently, she was required to show up only once every two weeks. At each visit, shed take one dose in person, then receive another 13 to take at home.\xa0 But now, the clinic had forced her to come in each morning: the consequence, it says, for partaking in a celebratory toast at her grandsons high-school graduation party. Smith, who said she had a few sips from a single glass of wine, was accused by the clinic of abusing alcohol and lost the permission to receive her take-home doses. No longer free for her early-morning shifts at a catering company, Smith told the clinic doctor that she faced an unthinkable choice. If he wanted her to attend the clinic daily, shed have to quit her job.\r\nIm going to church, I got my bank account, Im part of society, Ive got my life in order, she recalled saying. Its been over five years, and youre gonna do this to me? I said, yall doing stuff like this makes people go out there and relapse. Its like you dont care.\r\nSmiths medical records confirm her account. But the clinic was unswayed. As she predicted, Smith was forced to choose her medication over her job. Within weeks, she was late on rent for the apartment shes lived in for over a decade. In the ensuing three months, Smith dutifully showed up at the clinic each morning. She didnt consume alcohol or illegal drugs in any quantity. She begged her clinic to restore her take-home doses, restore her freedom, and allow her to return to work. But the clinic hasnt backed down.\r\nSmith is far from the only patient whose stability, and survival, are being jeopardized by iron-fisted methadone clinics, also known as opioid treatment programs (OTPs). A STAT investigation shows that many of the nations methadone clinics rely on controlling and punitive strategies that make it harder, not easier, for patients to maintain their recovery.\r\nThere is little evidence to support many of the clinics practices. Some clinic staff participating in medical decisions have no training in medicine.\r\nAs over 80,000 Americans die each year from opioid overdoses, patient advocates, public health experts, and doctors have increasingly come to question why methadone is accessible only at some 2,000 specialized clinics, many of which enforce outdated rules and offer low-quality care. The immense time commitment that daily clinic visits require, they argue, can also prevent patients from focusing on aspects of life that could aid their recovery, like their work, family, or education.\r\nThough federal regulators recently moved to loosen the regulations governing OTPs, even clinics attempting to provide convenient, compassionate care are still constricted by federal and local policy. Across the country, hundreds of clinics are required to supervise patients while they give urine samples, either in person or through a live video feed; restricted from prescribing doses large enough to alleviate patients withdrawal symptoms; and encouraged to taper patients off the medication after a set period, a practice that leading addiction researchers say is dangerous and unsupported by science.\r\nIn interviews, leaders in the world of methadone treatment advocacy acknowledged that the system has been slow to evolve since its inception over 50 years ago. But they stressed that the restrictions are intended as a safety measure: Methadone is itself an opioid, and when taken in excess, or in combination with other substances, can cause sedation or even overdose.\r\nThe primary opioid of abuse is fentanyl, said Mark Parrino, the founder and president of the American Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence (AATOD), a national advocacy organization that represents methadone clinics. When youre dealing with untreated fentanyl use, the idea of introducing another opiate, methadone, to treat [patients] has risks.\r\nThe strict protocols create a fundamental paradox: People with the most severe addictions are probably the least able to show up at a clinic each morning, and the least able to pay for treatment, which varies widely in price but often costs patients without insurance over $100 per week. As a result, those who need methadone the most are often the people who can access it the least.\r\nAlienated by the clinics rigid controls, people who use drugs are often driven away from methadone treatment or never seek it in the first place. At some programs, the high cost of care and lack of flexibility has led many patients to view fentanyl use as a cheaper, easier, and even safer option than enrolling in a methadone clinic.\r\nBy limiting methadone to this one structure, all this power has accumulated in one space, said Danielle Russell, an advocate, researcher, and methadone patient whose Ph.D. focused on methadone access. The clinics always make it clear to you that at any moment, they could snatch away a medication that helps you maintain stability and feel safe. There are no other options, and the clinics know that, and they treat you as such. Its hellacious.\r\nA nurse hands a cup of methadone to a person in a medical clinic in Washington, D.C., in 1971.Warren K. Leffler via Library of Congress\r\nThe most restricted medication\r\nMethadone was developed in pre-World War II Germany as a pain medication, and was first tested as a treatment for opioid addiction in the 1960s. In the U.S., methadone and buprenorphine, another addiction medication, are the only two drugs approved to treat the severe withdrawal and cravings that occur when people who use opioids suddenly stop. In the era of ultra-potent synthetic drugs like fentanyl, patients and doctors alike say it is all but impossible to quit illicit opioids without the aid of either medication.\r\nMethadone is the more effective of the two medications: Research shows that people who take it are 59% less likely to die of an opioid overdose. Despite the magnitude of the U.S. overdose epidemic, however, methadone remains the countrys most difficult medication to obtain. While any licensed doctor can prescribe methadone to treat pain, no doctor is permitted to write a methadone prescription to treat addiction, and patients like Smith cant simply pick up their medication at a local pharmacy. Instead, they must enroll in specialized clinics that, due to federal law, hold the exclusive right to distribute methadone as an addiction treatment and therefore hold enormous control over their patients lives.\r\nClinics say these rules are necessary to protect patients. Beyond potential side effects like heavy sweating, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction, methadone can cause overdose when used in excess or in combination with other medications. The risk appears greater when methadone is prescribed to treat pain, not addiction: Washington state, for example, saw a spike in methadone overdoses in the mid-2000s after its Medicaid program and other public insurers, in a bid to save money, began pushing patients toward methadone as an everyday pain drug. As an addiction treatment, too, methadone has risks. One study linked an uptick in methadone-involved deaths from 2019 to 2020 to methadone clinics more relaxed practices during the Covid-19 pandemic, though it noted the data does not allow for a causal attribution.\r\nBut overall, methadone causes far less harm than other opioids. The annual total of methadone-involved overdose deaths has remained roughly constant over the past decade, even as overall opioid deaths have skyrocketed. Of the 82,807 opioid overdose deaths recorded in 2022, 3,364 involved methadone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of those deaths, roughly two-thirds also involved an opioid besides methadone, like fentanyl or a prescription painkiller. Research also shows that even as methadone clinics significantly relaxed their restrictions and allowed more take-home medication in 2020, the share of opioid overdose deaths that involved methadone declined.\r\nStill, many Americans view the medication as hardly better than the potent opioids, like fentanyl and heroin, that people taking methadone no longer wish to use. Separately, some clinicians warn that wider access could lead to an increase in overdoses caused by methadone itself.\r\nWhen patients with severe fentanyl addiction and intertwined mental health conditions seek addiction treatment, high-quality care should entail more than just medication, said Kenneth Stoller, a Johns Hopkins addiction psychiatrist and member of AATODs board. To provide methadone without safeguards, he said, could spark even more backlash against a medication that society already views with suspicion.\r\nAll we need are a few front-page stories about how a drug got into the hands of a baby who died of an overdose, or how a person leaving home after taking too much of their medication got into a car accident and killed a family, he said. We will see a resurgence of severe stigma toward that medication.\r\nSo far, methadone clinics have gotten their way. Though addiction doctors in Germany, Australia, Canada, and other high-income countries can prescribe methadone directly to patients, in the U.S., it remains available only at specialized opioid treatment programs.\r\nA lockbox containing take-home doses of methadone in a patients home.Jessica Rinaldi/The Boston Globe\r\nIndignities and red tape\r\nPatients at methadone clinics go to extraordinary lengths to receive their medication, complying with rules and suffering indignities that would be unthinkable in any other health care setting. Patients commonly sign lengthy contracts agreeing to abide by clinic policies, and are often required to participate in frequent drug tests and counseling sessions as a condition of receiving their medication. In interviews, several patients, across multiple clinics, reported that they were admonished by clinic staff for not saying please or thank you.\r\nEven minor violations of clinic rules can result in major punishments. The total submissiveness that methadone treatment typically requires has led patients to bestow the medication with a damning nickname: liquid handcuffs.\r\nAbove all, clinics rules center on the requirement that patients come in each day to receive their dose. Some are eventually granted take-home privileges, in methadone clinic parlance. Others, however, have attended their clinics daily for years without earning take-homes.\r\nOften, patients who do receive take-homes must comply with strict rules that clinics say are designed to prevent misuse: They must bring a locked container to the clinic to store their doses, and bring back all of their empty methadone bottles every visit. Patients are also frequently subjected to call-backs: being told, without warning, that they have mere hours to show up at the clinic for inspection, medication bottles in hand. Punishment for not showing up for a call-back or a missing bottle may include having take-home doses reduced or rescinded entirely, leaving patients constantly at their clinics beck and call.\r\nEvery methadone clinic has got to look very deeply at themselves, and at their current policies, and they need to be rewritten, said Ruth Potee, an addiction doctor who runs several methadone clinics in Massachusetts. If you have not changed the number of take-home bottles youre giving, then shame on you.\r\ngo deeper\r\nMore in The War on Recovery\r\n<ul><li>New methadone treatment rules:\xa0The federal government is revising them for the first time in decades.

For those attempting to move forward from their addiction, clinic visits provide a daily reminder of a history theyd rather forget. Others attempting to stay sober find the visits to be a distraction, or even a threat to their recovery: In interviews, multiple patients reported being offered illicit fentanyl for sale while they waited in line.\r\nDaily dosing also poses logistical hurdles that force patients to structure their lives around their clinics dosing hours. Kevin Saunders, who attends a clinic in Biloxi, Miss., recounted a 5:30 a.m. frenzy each day as patients waiting for their clinic to open repeatedly pressed a button on a cellphone app, waiting for an automated system to assign them a place in line. Hitting the button just a few seconds late, he said, could be the difference between waiting five minutes and waiting an hour.\r\nRyan Fisher of Buckeye, Ariz., said he was denied take-homes despite consistent attendance and negative drug tests because the nearest clinic located in Phoenix, a nearly two-hour round trip misplaced his records, accused him of skipping appointments, and made no allowances for absences he had verified were due to his work schedule. Fisher eventually decided methadone treatment wasnt worth the expense and inconvenience of driving over 400 miles each week. He quit the medication cold turkey, a process he described as the worst three months of my life.\r\nSome patients spoke fondly of their counselors, crediting them with providing structure and guidance that helped them remain in treatment and move past their addiction. Others, however, cast the requirement that they participate in counseling as an obstacle to their care, or a means of boosting their clinics revenues. Russell, the methadone treatment researcher, said her counseling appointments at a Phoenix-area clinic often consisted solely of making sure she had paid her most recent clinic bills. She has since moved to Australia for a postdoctoral fellowship and because methadone there is far easier to access.\r\nEvery methadone clinic has got to look very deeply at themselves, and at their current policies, and they need to be rewritten.\r\nRuth Potee, addiction doctor\r\nLittle data is available about the quality of counseling at methadone clinics, and there is no federal standard for counselors qualifications. Longstanding federal guidelines acknowledge that many states permit non-licensed addictions counselors who may be qualified for their positions through training, education, and/or experience. One federal report from 2019 found great diversity and a lack of a standard model for counseling services offered alongside methadone or buprenorphine treatment.\r\nParrino, the head of the clinics advocacy group, acknowledged that in some cases, clinics fail to offer high-quality counseling.\r\nWhy do we need counseling if the counseling is crap? Its a fair question, Parrino said. This is where I happen to be aligned with the patient advocacy groups, and always have been: If the program is counter-therapeutic, if the policies are counter-therapeutic, if youre not engaging patients, if youre antagonizing or alienating the patients, you have to question what youre doing.\r\nPatients also reported alienating experiences related to drug testing. Some clinics require supervision while patients provide a urine sample either via camera or even from inside a bathroom stall. Many clinics use drug tests to determine whether their patients still use illicit substances, and shape their medical decisions accordingly. But clinics also commonly use the tests as justification to restrict take-home medication and to require their patients to attend more frequently not just when they test positive for illegal drugs or alcohol, but also, in some cases, when patients test positive for marijuana, even in states where marijuana is legal.\r\nOther patients said their clinics made it difficult to receive methadone doses that adequately quelled withdrawal symptoms throughout their 24-hour dosing interval. Beth Miller, who recently switched to a clinic in Connecticut, said her new provider has balked at requests to raise her dose to the level she safely took for 14 years while living a short drive away in Rhode Island.\r\nAnd while many patients prefer to split their dose in half so that they dont begin to feel withdrawal symptoms later in the day, many clinics insist that they take it all at once.\r\nOn the whole, the patients who recounted their experience said the clinics rigid policies made methadone treatment so difficult that some contemplated swearing off the medication altogether. In many cases, those who did returned to using heroin or fentanyl almost immediately.\r\nAlmost every single person I know who has overdosed has been on methadone at some point, and couldnt hack the restrictions or was terminated for some arbitrary reason, said Caty Simon, an advocate with the Urban Survivors Union and co-author of the Methadone Manifesto, a 2021 call for major reforms to the methadone treatment system.\r\nThese practices speak to the same fundamental issue, said Potee, the Massachusetts addiction doctor. Many methadone clinics behavior isnt designed to reduce patients odds of overdose, relapse, or death, she argued instead, its geared toward maximizing billable events and minimizing the risk of diversion, when clinic-prescribed methadone is misused or sold on the black market.\r\nQuality of care for patients is driven by the financial bottom line, she said.\r\nFrom a punitive place\r\nWhen the Nixon administration legalized methadone treatment in the 1970s, it viewed the system more as a crime-reduction tool rather than a means of providing health care. Experts on both sides of the methadone debate acknowledge that the system hasnt fully moved past its war on drugs roots: Some clinics still operate largely as they did over 50 years ago.\r\nIn an interview, Nick Stavros, the CEO of the fast-growing clinic chain Community Medical Services, acknowledged that the federal regulations that first created the methadone system came from a punitive place.\r\nAs a country, we do not treat addiction from a health care perspective, he said. We treat it from a punitive perspective. The federal regulations as they previously existed created a power differential where patients had less of a voice in their treatment.\r\nParrino, the AATOD president, agreed that the original system created a structure that would lead to very conservative judgments. He acknowledged, too, that many workers at OTPs still treat patients more like inmates. But he said those clinics are the exception, and most clinics today display far more compassion for patients than their critics believe.\r\nI dont agree with the view that the treatment settings are now more of an incarcerated environment, he said. However, in fairness, I would say that there are some program staff that operate as if they were in an incarcerated setting. I do not think it defines the system.\r\nWhile some methadone clinics choose to impose cumbersome restrictions on their patients, others do so because they have no choice. At the federal level, and in dozens of states, laws and regulations require clinics to enforce rules that are not based on medical evidence and, in some cases, punish patients in ways that harm their health.\r\nFederal laws require a set number of drug screens and encourage call-backs for patients receiving take-home doses. Regulations at the state level can be even more stringent, often mandating a minimum number of counseling sessions as a condition of participating in treatment. Many state regulators, also, have actively opposed the more flexible rules issued by the federal government during the Covid-19 pandemic namely allowing more generous take-home doses.\r\nAccording to the Pew Charitable Trusts, eight states also view discontinuation as the ultimate goal of methadone treatment, regardless of medical circumstance, even though the American Society of Addiction Medicine opposes discontinuation absent medical necessity or a patients preference. More than 50% of patients return to illicit opioid use within one month of discontinuing medication treatment, according to a recent study.\r\nIn every state besides Massachusetts and South Dakota, clinics are allowed to kick patients out for violating program rules. Many addiction experts have stressed, however, that the moments when patients violate program rules when they use illicit drugs, miss doses, or fail to show up for counseling sessions are the moments that put them at highest risk for overdose and in the greatest need of treatment. Several states also require clinics to notify regulators before prescribing a methadone dose higher than 120 milligrams, even as some patients attempting to quit fentanyl require doses twice or even three times as high.\r\nIn interviews, executives at methadone clinic chains acknowledged that, in many cases, federal and local regulations dont match their clinical judgment, including requirements that patients participate in a set number of counseling sessions.\r\nWe dont think people should be forced into it, said Ben Nordstrom, the chief medical officer of Behavioral Health Group, a major clinic chain. We operate in some states where there is a minimum counseling frequency, and we have to color within those lines.\r\nSimilarly, Nordstrom said that while he believes marijuana use is clinically irrelevant to his work, state regulations often leave his hands tied.\r\nI couldnt care less about smoking pot, and I dont think anybody I work with cares, he said. But if theres a state regulation that youve got to treat cannabis the same way youd treat cocaine, what do we do?\r\nThough he welcomed the relaxed federal rules, Nordstrom acknowledged their impact may be limited: The federal government has no power to compel states to treat clinics with more leniency. Likewise, while state regulators can loosen local restrictions, they have no mechanism to compel individual clinics to take advantage of those flexibilities and offer more patient-centered care.\r\nFor decades, methadone treatment has also faced intense cultural and political resistance. Last year alone, community activists held protests opposing the opening of new clinics in New York, Washington state, and Virginia. In the 1990s, national figures like Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) sought to effectively ban funding for clinics. Smiths birthplace of West Virginia, home to the nations highest opioid death rate, has enforced a moratorium on new methadone clinics since 2007.\r\nDespite the cumbersome regulations, some experts say that truly motivated clinic directors could still work within existing rules to provide flexible, compassionate care and still, many choose not to.\r\nOTP medical directors have always had the opportunity to be creative and figure out how to provide high-quality care, said Frances McGaffey, the Pew Charitable Trusts researcher who assembled a comprehensive analysis of state policies governing methadone treatment. But not all of them have taken advantage of that, or have had the capacity to figure out workarounds.\r\nThis is not helping me\r\nRebecca Smith was born in January 1959, the ninth of 12 siblings in Hinton, W.Va., a rural town of roughly 5,000 at the time. At 18, she moved to Michigan to be near her uncles and because, she felt, there were no jobs for Black people in West Virginia.\r\nHer path to heroin, and then to treatment, began nearly three decades ago. By then, Smith had married, settled in Detroit, and started a family. Her husband, Ronald White, worked on the assembly line at Ford Motor Company; she worked as a medical assistant.\r\nBut in 1996, White died in his early 40s of pancreatic and liver cancer a destabilizing loss that led Smith to turn to drugs in an effort to mask her grief.\r\nIt just seemed like I was thrown into the world naked, with nothing, Smith said. I love my children deeply. I love them so much. But it was just really hard for me to accept his death. And thats when I started using.\r\nThe next two decades were a roller coaster: Smith used, then quit, then used more, then quit again. She lost custody of her two youngest children. She was diagnosed with kidney cancer. And she fought her first battle against a methadone treatment provider: After having a kidney surgically removed, Smith said one clinic falsely accused her of drinking too much water in an effort to skew the results of her urine drug screens. The clinic tapered her off the medication without her consent and ejected her from its care. She soon relapsed, kicking off another yearslong cycle of heroin use.\r\nEventually, Smith settled into the treatment program at Tolan Park Research Clinic in Detroits Midtown neighborhood, showing up daily until the clinic finally awarded her multiple days of take-home medication, then a week, then two weeks. She took a job with a catering company owned by her daughter, Tameca.\r\nSmith felt that her redemption arc was complete. She had conquered heroin addiction. She had made amends with her children including two younger sons who were adopted after child protective services intervened.\r\nThen she celebrated her grandsons graduation from Cass Tech, a prestigious Detroit high school, with a few sips of wine. The next morning, she went to her clinic to receive her two weeks of take-home doses, meet with her counselor, and drop clinic slang for leaving a urine sample for a drug test.\r\nAlcohol metabolites later showed up on the urine screen, and Smith was honest with her counselor about having partaken in the celebratory toasts.\r\nBut staff at her clinic didnt see the family celebration as a triumph. Though Smith has never exhibited problems related to drinking, Tolan Park accused her of abusing alcohol and rescinded her take-home medications.\r\nSmith (right) celebrates with her daughter and grandson after he was accepted to Michigan State University.Courtesy Rebecca Smith\r\nSmith was forced to quit her job. She does not own a car. Thanks to a recent knee surgery, and an anticipated second procedure she was forced to postpone once the clinic made her attend daily, making the 1-mile journey on foot is not an option. In Detroit, neither is public transportation. Smith, instead, has had to take an Uber each way, every day. Each voyage costs her at least $8, meaning that the clinic rescinding her take-home privileges didnt just strip her of her income it also compelled her to spend hundreds of dollars each month on transportation alone.\r\nI want you to check me if Im actually doing something wrong and that would hurt me in my recovery, Smith said. Im very serious about my recovery. But this is not helping me in my recovery. This is not doing nothin for me, because I dont feel that Ive abused anything.\r\nSmiths clinic records state her take-home doses were rescinded due to drinking. But they make no mention of prior alcohol use, and the doctors notes in Smiths file are nothing but positive: They describe her as cooperative, calm, pleasant and her intelligence as above-average.\xa0\r\nPatient is here for positive drug screen, Andrew King, the clinics medical director, wrote in a record documenting Smiths visit. She had alcohol during a celebration. She freely admits this. She is here to have the discussion about the repercussions of alcohol usage at a methadone clinic.\r\nThe doctor added: We will be consistent with clinic policy and she will be dosing daily.\r\nIn an email, King declined to comment on Smiths specific case. But he wrote that addiction care is complicated and requires the balancing of factors including co-occuring mental or physical illness, patient and community safety, and government regulations.\r\nThe treatment of substance use disorders is highly stigmatized and private. It is our policy not to discuss individual patients care, he wrote. There are many different angles to every story, which are person and context-dependent.\r\nPushing for flexibility\r\nAs the opioid crisis has grown worse, methadone clinics practices have attracted more scrutiny. Lawmakers, patients, and doctor groups like the American Society of Addiction Medicine have called for allowing methadone to be prescribed far more liberally. In a 2019 report, the National Academy of Medicine found that the current regulations around methadone are not supported by evidence.\r\nMany OTP clients simply have no recourse, and nowhere to turn if they are not given take-homes or forced into counseling that doesnt meet their needs, said McGaffey, the Pew researcher. There might be a single OTP within driving distance. Those people just have to comply with rules that dont fit their lives and dont make sense for them.\r\nClinics are not uniformly rigid or unsympathetic: Increasingly, many offer flexible, patient-centered care that involves higher initial doses and less invasive means of supervised drug testing, like using saliva swabs instead of urine samples. Take-home medication has become far more common, thanks to the pandemic-era rule changes.\r\nThe clinics that choose to be more flexible will get a boost from a\xa0significant overhaul of federal regulations that take effect next month. Besides making more take-home doses a permanent option, the new rules allow higher initial doses. They also warn clinics against using toxicology testing punitively in effect, warning against treating patients the way Tolan Park has treated Smith.\r\nMany patient advocates say the changes dont go nearly far enough and a select few call for abolishing the methadone clinic system entirely.\r\nBut Nora Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, advocated for a middle ground that echoes one popular proposal from Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.): allowing the additional option of doctors to prescribe methadone directly to patients, whod pick the medication up at a pharmacy.\r\nWe need the opioid treatment programs, but it need not be so restrictive, said Volkow. Theres no reason we cannot have both: Those that see the value of attending the OTP continue, while at the same time make it easier for patients to be able to get their methadone [from] their physician, or in a pharmacy.\r\nEven if the clinic monopoly were to be broken, its unclear how many non-clinic doctors would be willing to prescribe methadone, especially given the scrutiny that opioid prescribers face in the wake of the prescription opioid oversupply crisis of the early 2000s. Separately, many pharmacies already decline to stock buprenorphine. It stands to reason that many would also refuse to stock methadone.\r\nThis is a good opportunity to completely reexamine how treatment is offered to patients, said Parrino, the AATOD president. But offering methadone outside the context of an OTP, he said, could easily do more harm than good.\r\nThis is a classic public health risk assessment, he added. How many lives will be saved, and how many will die? I dont know the answer.\r\nSmith at home in Detroit.Alex Hogan/STAT\r\nShes not even listening\r\nRebecca Smith is still alive.\r\nIn the half-year since her clinic radically reshaped her life, shes never been tempted to return to illicit drugs. She has fully abstained from alcohol even from champagne toasts at family gatherings. Shes complied with her clinic even as it has forced her to effectively start over as a new patient, earning take-home doses in small increments.\r\nSmith relied on her family and her sheer determination to stay healthy. At last, the modest take-home privileges that her clinic recently restored have allowed her to return to work. In another few months, her clinic has indicated it may finally give back the freedom she previously enjoyed: One visit every two weeks, and 13 days of take-home medication in between.\r\nBut she knows others arent so lucky. Across the country, other patients have been ejected from clinics, had take-home doses rescinded, or been forced to withdraw from treatment programs because of restrictions they couldnt keep up with.\r\nTheyre making it easier for me to relapse, in a way, because of some of the rules theyre trying to throw at you, Smith said. Im pouring my heart out to my counselor. But its like shes not even listening to me, and the doctors not even listening to me. I still feel like a second-class citizen.\r\nSTATs coverage of chronic health issues is supported by a grant from\xa0Bloomberg Philanthropies.

"{'Lawmakers are drawing heat over their pushback against\xa0a federal grant program meant to reduce harm among drug users with ""safe smoking kits,"" with advocates decrying the claims that taxpayer money is being spent on crack pipes.\r\nThe outrage began earlier this month, when\xa0right-wing media outlets\xa0started reporting the Biden administration was funding crack pipe distribution in a bid to advance racial equity an accusation the White House has repeatedly pushed back on as false.\r\nBut as the narrative took hold on social media, lawmakers brought the issue to Capitol Hill.\r\nSen. Marsha BlackburnMarsha BlackburnSenate passes bill to avert government shutdownOn The Money Retail sales rallied in face of omicron Hillicon Valley Senators introduce online kids\' safety billMORE (R-Tenn.) temporarily put a hold on a spending bill intended to avert a government shutdown after citing a report on the kits by\xa0The Washington Free Beacon.\r\nThe objections gained steam when Sen.

Joe ManchinJoe ManchinColor in the climate crisisOvernight Energy &amp; Environment Court ruling delays oil and gas leasingUS, Egypt launch joint working group ahead of UN climate change summitMORE (D-W.Va.) that sought to bar federal funds for pipes used for crack cocaine, as well as syringes and needles.\xa0\r\nThe efforts are being slammed and mocked by advocates who say lawmakers are trying to score political points by opposing funding for what they see as proven methods to reduce harm to people who use drugs, particularly as overdose deaths hit new highs nationwide.\r\nWe are in, literally, a record-breaking overdose epidemic, and for lawmakers to go after harm reduction tools when we need all tools at our disposal to save lives is so irresponsible its shocking, Maritza Perez, the director of the office of national affairs at the Drug Policy Alliance, told The Hill.\r\nThe outrage stems from a new program announced months back that seeks to increase access to harm reduction services for drug users as part of a larger effort to combat that epidemic, which has worsened during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\r\nIn\xa0December, the Biden administration unveiled plans for $30 million to be put toward the launch of a first-ever harm reduction grant program run by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which operates under the Department of Health and Human Services.\r\nOfficials said the funding was intended to support harm-reduction services such as the provision of safe smoking kits to reduce health risks to drug users.\r\nWhile pushing back on reports that the administration is funding distribution of pipes, White House press secretary Jen PsakiJen PsakiBiden has done interviews with multiple Supreme Court contendersPsaki confirms Biden-Putin meeting off the tableWatch live: White House holds press briefing amid escalating tensions in UkraineMORE\xa0said\xa0earlier this month that kits being provided through the SAMHSA program could contain items such as alcohol swabs, lip balm and clean syringes.\xa0\r\n""I would note that what were really talking about here is steps we\'re taking as a federal government to really address the opioid epidemic, which is killing tens of thousands, if not more, Americans, every single day, week, month of the year,"" Psaki said at the time.\r\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released\xa0data last week estimating 104,288 overdose deaths in the United States for the 12-month period ending in September a figure that an agency representative confirmed Tuesday is a new high.\r\nIn recent months, the CDC has also reported a rise in deaths from synthetic opioids, consisting primarily of fentanyl, as well as psychostimulants such methamphetamine.\r\nPeter Davidson, a professor at the University of California-San Diego with years of research experience in areas including drug intervention, stressed the importance of harm reduction services in an interview, while pointing to fentanyl as one of the things that\'s really driving the overdose death epidemic at the moment.\r\nWhat I would really wish and hope for is that lawmakers from any political party, when they first hear this, would actually go out and find out what the science and the evidence actually says about these things, rather than just having an immediate gut reaction, Davidson said.\r\nAccording to the\xa0World Health Organization, people who inject drugs are more likely to contract HIV, tuberculosis and viral hepatitis B and C. The WHO, citing 2020 data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, said that, of the roughly 11 million people who inject drugs across the globe, about 13 percent live with HIV and 39.4 percent have viremic HCV infection.\r\nA January brief published\xa0by the University of Washington\'s Addictions, Drug &amp; Alcohol Institute said the distribution of safer smoking drug supplies is effective in helping reduce health risks and infection spread from the sharing of smoking supplies.\r\nAccording to the\xa0CDC, decades of research have shown that comprehensive syringe services programs are also a proven means to helping reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, HIV and other infections.\r\nDaniel Raymond, director of policy at National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable, said the time devoted on Capitol Hill to the recent uproar could have been better spent educating the public instead of jumping to stigma and politicized attacks.\r\nThe drugs that we\'re concerned about that are driving overdose rates are different now than they were 10 years ago, he said, and we have to continue to adapt and evolve our strategies to keep up with that reality, and make sure that we\'re hitting the mark.\r\nSome advocates also took issue with rhetoric used by lawmakers and conservative media around the outrage.\r\nFirst of all, the notion that the government is distributing pipes is racist dog whistling. What we\'re talking about are glass pipes, but they use the word \'crack pipes\' for a specific reason, Perez said, before evoking the nations war on drugs and its disproportionate impact on the Black community.\r\nIt\'s another reminder that some people are really willing to stigmatize people who use drugs and kind of perpetuate the racist narratives that fuel the war on drugs, said Jenna Mellor, executive director New Jersey Harm Reduction Coalition.\r\nRubio and other opponents of the government plans to fund safe smoking kits argue that certain tools, such needles, could exacerbate substance use disorder and that they should not be funded by taxpayer dollars.\r\nBut advocates say treatment-first or treatment-only approaches are not always effective.\r\nAccording to 2019 data provided by\xa0SAMHSA, nearly 19 million people aged 12 or older who dealt with an illicit drug use disorder, alcohol use disorder or both went without treatment at a specialty facility. More than 18 million of those did not feel that they needed treatment, the office said.\r\nCaitlin O\'Neill, founder of the New Jersey Harm Reduction Coalition, told The Hill that there\'s a small group of people for whom abstinence does work. But, even in that group, she added, return to use is very normal and very common.\r\nBut advocates say distribution of safer smoking drug supplies has helped serve as a gateway to additional resources for those who use drugs, such as connections to treatment, options for HIV testing, counseling services and food.\r\nWhen someone is being handed a safer smoking kit, it\'s not just being like [at a] drive thru window, you get it and you walk away and you don\'t connect with someone. It\'s being handed to you, and you\'re usually being asked a question of like, what\'s going on? How are you using? added O\'Neill, who said she has also dealt with substance abuse in the past and previously used a harm reduction program.\r\nRubios legislation to bar federal funding for pipes and other drug paraphernalia was blocked by Senate Democrats last week. But the Florida Republican, who is up for reelection this November, has signaled in comments to reporters that the fight is not over.\r\nWell be back on this, he said days ago after a vote on his bill failed.\xa0\r\nThe Hill has reached out to Rubios office for further information.\r\nThough O\'Neill said harm reduction services have seen much funding from local state funding or private funding, as well as grassroots fundraising, she expressed concerns about whether the stigma at a national level like this over the SAMHSA program could hurt expansion for similar services going forward.\r\nBut it won\'t stop our efforts on the ground, she quickly added. We\'re going to continue to take care of each other because that\'s what we do and if the government doesn\'t show up for us, we\'re gonna continue to show up for each other.': ""{'PERSON': ['Marsha BlackburnMarsha Blackburn', 'Marco RubioMarco Antonio Rubio', 'Joe ManchinJoe Manchin', 'Maritza Perez', 'Jen PsakiJen Psaki', 'Peter Davidson', 'Daniel Raymond', 'Jenna Mellor', 'Caitlin O\\'Neill', 'Rubio'], \n'DATE': ['earlier this month', 'In December', 'last week', 'this November', 'days ago'], \n'LOC': ['Capitol Hill', 'United States', 'University of California-San Diego', 'New Jersey'], \n'ORG': ['Doctors Without Borders', 'the Drug Policy Alliance', 'the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Department of Health and Human Services', 'White House', 'the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'World Health Organization', 'the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime', 'the University of Washington\\'s Addictions, Drug &amp; Alcohol Institute', 'CDC', 'National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable', 'New Jersey Harm Reduction Coalition', 'SAMHSA'], \n'PROGRAMS': ['federal grant program', 'harm reduction grant program', 'SAMHSA program'], \n'IMPACT': ['reduce harm among drug users', 'increase access to harm reduction services for drug users', 'support harm-reduction services', 'reduce health risks to drug users', 'address the opioid epidemic', 'reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, HIV and other infections', 'educating the public instead of jumping to stigma and politicized attacks', 'adapt and evolve our strategies to keep up with that reality', 'gateway to additional resources for those who use drugs', 'connections to treatment, options for HIV testing, counseling services and food']}}""}"
