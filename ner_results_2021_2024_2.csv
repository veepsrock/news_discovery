"{'International Overdose Awareness Day began in Australia 20 years ago to raise awareness of overdoses, reduce the stigma of drug-related deaths, and remind us of the grief felt by the families and friends of those who have died as a result of substance use disorder (SUD). Today, as the death toll from overdose continues to increase, International Overdose Awareness Day is recognized in more than 40 countries. We pause on August 31 to honor those lost as well as raise awareness and instigate action and discussion about evidence-based prevention and drug policy.\r\nUnfortunately, the arrival of COVID-19 exacerbated an already worsening trend in overdoses and related deaths. The American Medical Association recently released an issue brief on our countrys overdose epidemic, revealing some very concerning data:\r\n<ul><li>Every state has reported a spike or increase in overdose deaths or other problems during the pandemic.</li><li>The overdose epidemic is now driven by illicit fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, methamphetamine, and cocaine, often in combination or in adulterated forms.</li><li>Overdoses related to prescription opioids and heroin, also increasingly adulterated with illicit fentanyl, remain high.</li></ul>Opioids were not the only drug leading to increased death during the coronavirus pandemic. Alcohol abuse has also grown substantially in the year-and-a-half that COVID-19 has ravaged the world. The BBC reported these statistics for England and Wales, just during the first nine months of 2020:\r\n<ul><li>5,460 alcohol-related deaths, an increase of 16 percent from the same months in 2019.</li><li>The highest death toll attributed to alcohol since records began in 2001.</li><li>Deaths peaked at 12.8 deaths per 100,000 people in the first three months of 2020 and stayed at that level through September, also a record high.</li><li>The rates of male alcohol-specific deaths were twice those of women.</li></ul>The isolation, fear, anxiety, and grief generated by COVID-19 have contributed to the misuse of substances of all kinds. We also know that for those coping with any form of SUD, consistent support is key. Let us take a closer look at how that support has been altered by COVID-19, before we explore what can be done to reverse the growing overdose trend. \r\nDeprived of Community\r\nFor many of us, quarantine and physical distancing have been annoying and tedious; to those who require life-saving medications, healthcare providers, and a social support system to recover from SUD, pandemic-generated restrictions have led to life-and-death situations of a different kind. Provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that the U.S. saw nearly 92,000 drug overdose deaths from November 2019 to October 2020, the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a 12-month period. \r\nUniversity of Virginia anthropology professor and author Jarrett Zigon recently wrote: Addiction is often called a disease of loneliness, and during the pandemic, loneliness is something that many more people experienced. Professor Zigon admits that overdose increases during COVID-19 are not surprising, since it has been so difficult for those living with SUD to rebuild meaningful social connections and have hope for the future.\r\nAshley Bolton, Pennsylvanias director of the Office of Drug Surveillance and Misuse Prevention, takes the consequences of coronavirus isolation one step further, We also have heard from local communities, an increase of individuals using substances alone, so the opportunity to utilize Naloxone may have been lower by a bystander. Also the fear of going to the emergency department, especially early in the pandemic.\r\nIsolation is not the only factor that has contributed to increased overdose deaths. The National Institute on Drug Abuse points out that public health measures have disrupted the flow of resources such as methadone dispensed from clinics. This increases the risk of relapse, as do stress about employment, money, family, and housing. \r\nIn-Person to Virtual: A Shift in Engagement\r\nThose living with addiction endured one significant change in the early days of the pandemic: the suspension of in-person Narcotics Anonymous (NA) and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings.\r\nRecovering alcoholic Daniel Martin McCormick says, The switch from in-person to online at the onset of the pandemic was overnight. He describes the move from the stability and comfort of in-person AA meetings to Zoom, where there were no hugs, handshakes, or after-meeting gatherings at a local coffee shop. There were Zoom bombers, time limits, and the challenge of staring into a screen. Some people were uncomfortable meeting online or were unable to do so because they lacked the technology or connectivity.\r\nYet McCormicks group worked hard to maintain the 12 steps and 12 traditions of AA even as it met virtually. It welcomed participants from different time zones and a new type of community. McCormick also describes how the anonymity of Zoom (with no need to turn on your camera or use your real name), emboldened some who had never attended an AA meeting to take that first step toward recovery. \r\nNarcotics Anonymous also uses the Zoom platform for its virtual meetings. To achieve its mission, to provide a context where people experiencing addiction can help one another stop using drugs and find a new way to live, NA created a new website, virtual-NA.org. Today, it offers more than 2,800 online meetings every week, Sunday through Saturday, in a range of languages. These sessions not only support those who formerly went to live meetings but also people in rural settings who found it difficult to be part of an in-person group. Like AA, what were once local NA meetings became national and international. Like many other organizations, NA and AA expect their post-pandemic models to include both in-person and virtual groups. \r\nActions Aimed at Reversing the Trend\r\nBesides traditional outreach like NA and AA, there are new resources for those at risk of overdose. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has created a tip sheet on virtual recovery options for those with substance use and mental disorders. For people in an opioid treatment program, SAMHSA also has issued guidance for states to receive an exception to administer 14 to 28 days of take-home medication. Additionally, the American Society of Addiction Medicine has prepared a Clinical Practice Guideline on Alcohol Withdrawal Management, to especially help patients whose evidence-based treatment may have been limited by the pandemic.\r\nWhile deficiencies remain in our country, individual states are leading the way in acting on behalf of those living with addiction or in recovery. Rhode Island recently enacted a law that mandates SUD and mental health services provided by organizations such as NA and AA as essential. These groups and others may now hold meetings during a declared disaster emergency, because they are deemed necessary for public health.\r\nIn addition, Rhode Island has established a two-year pilot program beginning in March 2022 to design, open, and operate the first harm reduction centers in the U.S. Also known as overdose prevention sites or supervised injection facilities, these centers will direct people to treatment for SUDs as well as behavioral and physical health screenings and recovery assistance.\r\nIn Pennsylvania, where drug overdose deaths went up nearly 14 percent from 2019 to 2020and 63 percent among its Black population from 2018 to 2020officials are dedicated to overcoming the issues compounded by COVID-19 restrictions. Working closely with counties, cities and towns, the Pennsylvania Coordinated Medication-Assisted Treatment program is increasing its overdose prevention and response services throughout the state, with 8,000+ people already receiving PacMAT treatment.\r\nTaking a different tack, Oregon decriminalized possession of small amounts of almost all hard drugs last year. With its rates of drug and alcohol addiction near the top of all statesand almost at the bottom for access to recovery servicesit decided to take on SUD with a health model rather than criminalization.\r\nOregon also aimed to lessen or even eradicate racial and ethnic disparities in convictions and arrests. Without a criminal record, those with SUD should find it easier to get housing, jobs, student loans, and professional licenses. Of course, COVID-19 has made implementation more complex, due to reductions in treatment beds and services. With vocal advocates and detractors, the experiment remains a work in progress. \r\nIndividuals Making a Difference, Too\r\nIn recognition of World Entrepreneurs Day (August 21), I would be remiss in omitting the many creative business people who continue to join in the fight against SUD and overdose. Four years ago, INC Magazine featured eight new companies focused on battling the opioid epidemic. Today, those companies are still at it, taking on addiction treatment and recovery with innovative apps, therapies, and data analysis.\r\nAs an entrepreneur myself, I have dedicated my career to improving access to quality substance abuse, mental health, and medical treatment and prevention services. It is a global public health effort, achieved by helping one person at a time, which holds great meaning for me. If you are able to volunteer for organizations assisting those living with addiction or in recovery, please do so. Your efforts will honor both those whom we have lost to overdose and the many we will work together to save.': ""{{'PERSON': ['Vivian Peng', 'Jarrett Zigon', 'Ashley Bolton', 'Daniel Martin McCormick'], 'DATE': ['August 31', 'November 2019 to October 2020', 'first nine months of 2020', 'March 2022', 'Four years ago', 'World Entrepreneurs Day (August 21)'], 'LOC': ['Australia', 'U.S.', 'Virginia', 'Pennsylvania', 'Rhode Island', 'Oregon', 'England and Wales'], 'ORG': ['International Overdose Awareness Day', 'American Medical Association', 'BBC', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Office of Drug Surveillance and Misuse Prevention', 'National Institute on Drug Abuse', 'Narcotics Anonymous (NA)', 'Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)', 'Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)', 'American Society of Addiction Medicine', 'INC Magazine'], 'PROGRAMS': ['International Overdose Awareness Day', 'resource hub', 'Narcotics Anonymous', 'Alcoholics Anonymous', 'Pennsylvania Coordinated Medication-Assisted Treatment program', 'Clinical Practice Guideline on Alcohol Withdrawal Management', 'PacMAT treatment'], 'IMPACT': ['raise awareness of overdoses', 'reduce the stigma of drug-related deaths', 'support has been altered by COVID-19', 'increased overdose deaths', 'community altered by shift from in-person to virtual meetings', 'establishment of harm reduction centers', 'decriminalization of possession of certain drugs']}}""}"

Provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that the U.S. saw nearly 92,000 drug overdose deaths from November 2019 to October 2020, the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a 12-month period. \r\nUniversity of Virginia anthropology professor and author Jarrett Zigon recently wrote: Addiction is often called a disease of loneliness, and during the pandemic, loneliness is something that many more people experienced. Professor Zigon admits that overdose increases during COVID-19 are not surprising, since it has been so difficult for those living with SUD to rebuild meaningful social connections and have hope for the future.\r\nAshley Bolton, Pennsylvanias director of the Office of Drug Surveillance and Misuse Prevention, takes the consequences of coronavirus isolation one step further, We also have heard from local communities, an increase of individuals using substances alone, so the opportunity to utilize Naloxone may have been lower by a bystander. Also the fear of going to the emergency department, especially early in the pandemic.\r\nIsolation is not the only factor that has contributed to increased overdose deaths. The National Institute on Drug Abuse points out that public health measures have disrupted the flow of resources such as methadone dispensed from clinics. This increases the risk of relapse, as do stress about employment, money, family, and housing. \r\nIn-Person to Virtual: A Shift in Engagement\r\nThose living with addiction endured one significant change in the early days of the pandemic: the suspension of in-person Narcotics Anonymous (NA) and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings.\r\nRecovering alcoholic Daniel Martin McCormick says, The switch from in-person to online at the onset of the pandemic was overnight. He describes the move from the stability and comfort of in-person AA meetings to Zoom, where there were no hugs, handshakes, or after-meeting gatherings at a local coffee shop. There were Zoom bombers, time limits, and the challenge of staring into a screen. Some people were uncomfortable meeting online or were unable to do so because they lacked the technology or connectivity.\r\nYet McCormicks group worked hard to maintain the 12 steps and 12 traditions of AA even as it met virtually. It welcomed participants from different time zones and a new type of community. McCormick also describes how the anonymity of Zoom (with no need to turn on your camera or use your real name), emboldened some who had never attended an AA meeting to take that first step toward recovery. \r\nNarcotics Anonymous also uses the Zoom platform for its virtual meetings. To achieve its mission, to provide a context where people experiencing addiction can help one another stop using drugs and find a new way to live, NA created a new website, virtual-NA.org. Today, it offers more than 2,800 online meetings every week, Sunday through Saturday, in a range of languages. These sessions not only support those who formerly went to live meetings but also people in rural settings who found it difficult to be part of an in-person group. Like AA, what were once local NA meetings became national and international. Like many other organizations, NA and AA expect their post-pandemic models to include both in-person and virtual groups. \r\nActions Aimed at Reversing the Trend\r\nBesides traditional outreach like NA and AA, there are new resources for those at risk of overdose. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has created a tip sheet on virtual recovery options for those with substance use and mental disorders. For people in an opioid treatment program, SAMHSA also has issued guidance for states to receive an exception to administer 14 to 28 days of take-home medication. Additionally, the American Society of Addiction Medicine has prepared a Clinical Practice Guideline on Alcohol Withdrawal Management, to especially help patients whose evidence-based treatment may have been limited by the pandemic.\r\nWhile deficiencies remain in our country, individual states are leading the way in acting on behalf of those living with addiction or in recovery. Rhode Island recently enacted a law that mandates SUD and mental health services provided by organizations such as NA and AA as essential. These groups and others may now hold meetings during a declared disaster emergency, because they are deemed necessary for public health.\r\nIn addition, Rhode Island has established a two-year pilot program beginning in March 2022 to design, open, and operate the first harm reduction centers in the U.S. Also known as overdose prevention sites or supervised injection facilities, these centers will direct people to treatment for SUDs as well as behavioral and physical health screenings and recovery assistance.\r\nIn Pennsylvania, where drug overdose deaths went up nearly 14 percent from 2019 to 2020and 63 percent among its Black population from 2018 to 2020officials are dedicated to overcoming the issues compounded by COVID-19 restrictions. Working closely with counties, cities and towns, the Pennsylvania Coordinated Medication-Assisted Treatment program is increasing its overdose prevention and response services throughout the state, with 8,000+ people already receiving PacMAT treatment.\r\nTaking a different tack, Oregon decriminalized possession of small amounts of almost all hard drugs last year. With its rates of drug and alcohol addiction near the top of all statesand almost at the bottom for access to recovery servicesit decided to take on SUD with a health model rather than criminalization.\r\nOregon also aimed to lessen or even eradicate racial and ethnic disparities in convictions and arrests. Without a criminal record, those with SUD should find it easier to get housing, jobs, student loans, and professional licenses. Of course, COVID-19 has made implementation more complex, due to reductions in treatment beds and services. With vocal advocates and detractors, the experiment remains a work in progress. \r\nIndividuals Making a Difference, Too\r\nIn recognition of World Entrepreneurs Day (August 21), I would be remiss in omitting the many creative business people who continue to join in the fight against SUD and overdose. Four years ago, INC Magazine featured eight new companies focused on battling the opioid epidemic. Today, those companies are still at it, taking on addiction treatment and recovery with innovative apps, therapies, and data analysis.\r\nAs an entrepreneur myself, I have dedicated my career to improving access to quality substance abuse, mental health, and medical treatment and prevention services. It is a global public health effort, achieved by helping one person at a time, which holds great meaning for me. If you are able to volunteer for organizations assisting those living with addiction or in recovery, please do so. Your efforts will honor both those whom we have lost to overdose and the many we will work together to save.': ""{'PERSON': ['Vivian Peng', 'Daniel Martin McCormick', 'Jarrett Zigon', 'Ashley Bolton'], 'DATE': ['August 31', 'November 2019 to October 2020', 'first nine months of 2020', 'March 2022', 'World Entrepreneurs Day (August 21)'], 'LOC': ['Australia', 'U.S.', 'England and Wales', 'Pennsylvania', 'Oregon', 'Rhode Island'], 'ORG': ['Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'University of Virginia', 'Office of Drug Surveillance and Misuse Prevention', 'National Institute on Drug Abuse', 'Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'American Society of Addiction Medicine', 'BBC', 'American Medical Association'], 'PROGRAMS': ['International Overdose Awareness Day', 'Narcotics Anonymous', 'Alcoholics Anonymous', 'virtual-NA.org', 'Clinical Practice Guideline on Alcohol Withdrawal Management', 'Pennsylvania Coordinated Medication-Assisted Treatment program', 'harm reduction centers'], 'IMPACT': ['raise awareness of overdoses', 'reduce the stigma of drug-related deaths', 'provide a context where people experiencing addiction can stop using drugs and find a new way to live', 'increase the risk of relapse', 'reduce racial and ethnic disparities in convictions and arrests']}""}"
"{'As a psychiatrist who treats patients with all kinds of addictions, I frequently hear some version of the following: When I realized that my compulsive use of (some substance of abuse) was simply due to chemical changes in my brain, and not due to weakness or a moral failing, I felt like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders. \r\nIt is now widely understood that addictive behavior results from imbalanced neurochemistry, with genetic, neurophysiologic, and biological origins. Studies show that embracing the disease model of addiction, which describes drug and alcohol use disorders as being chronic diseases that need treatment just like cancer or diabetes, reduces self-blame, and makes it possible for people to let go of unhelpful ideas that they have a character flaw or a lack of will-power. Moreover, it reduces stigma and negative attitudes directed towards people with compulsive drug or alcohol use, which has numerous positive impacts on research, treatment access, and recovery trajectories.\r\nThe food addition concept is also growing in popularity. This model describes overeating behavior in similar terms as other additive behavior and argues that for some people overeating is also attributable to altered brain chemistry. Although brain-based explanations have helped in drug and alcohol use disorders, there is controversy in the field about what impact this model will have on public perceptions of people who live in larger bodies.\r\nFood acts on the brain like drugs\r\nIncreasing evidence in animal models and humans indicates that certain foods (especially high-sugar/carbohydrate, high-fat, and highly processed) can act on the brain like classic addictive substances to cause a syndrome that mirrors what is seen in substance use disorders. When these kinds of foods are consumed, brain regions that process reward are activated, and dopamine and opioids are released. With repeated consumption, conditioning occurs, as a result of changes in the strength of neural connections, such that a previously neutral cue in the environment (like a grocery store aisle) or a certain mood-state (like irritability) become increasingly robust triggers of food craving and/or compulsive behaviors to procure palatable food. Increasing consumption of these foods can also lead to tolerance and withdrawal, and it may even cause brain changes that increase impulsivity. A vicious cycle ensues, which makes it more and more difficult to control the amounts and quantities of food consumed, and ultimately may lead to weight gain and obesity in some people.\r\nPeople with obesity are stigmatized\r\nObese individuals are unfortunately subject to numerous prejudicial messages from society. Struggles with weight are perceived to be due to laziness, an inherent character flaw, or low self-control, motivation, or intelligence. Individuals who are not seen as responsible for their condition (e.g., Alzheimers) receive more sympathy than overweight individuals, who are perceived to be more at fault. Stigmatizing beliefs obstruct policy changes to reduce the pervasiveness of unhelpful foods, and to harness support for better treatments and prevention, and they can lead to discrimination in the employment realm, challenges with interpersonal friendships and dating, and victimization or teasing for children.\r\nThe negative messages from society are absorbed by the person struggling with weight as internalized stigma, which causes increases in shame, reduced self-esteem, negative mood, and self-loathing, and may inhibit people from seeking help from behavioral health and medical providers. These emotions can trigger further eating to self-soothe, and undermine weight loss attempts. Fear of being stigmatized predicts worsening food addiction status, reduced exercise, stress, and weight gain.\r\nWidespread acceptance of the food addiction concept might worsen stigma\r\nThere is some concern that the food addiction concept, if embraced, could backfire, and increase stigmatizing beliefs. Explaining overeating in addiction terms might invoke stereotypes associated with illicit drug users, making people think of someone untrustworthy or bad. In support of this, a study showed that the obese food addict label evoked more stigmatizing positions (e.g., study participants saw the use as a personal choice more) than the food addict or obese terms used alone. Some other work indicates that the term food addiction label might increase stigma regarding obesity and reduce self-efficacy.\r\nOn the other hand, it might reduce stigma and self-blame\r\nOn the other hand, the food addiction term, by highlighting the brain-based aspects of the disorder, might also reduce these negative views, increasing societys compassion for the struggles of people in larger bodies, seeing overeating as a medical problem that needs treatment, not due to some moral failing. A study found that a food addiction-based explanatory model of overeating resulted in lower stigma, blame, and perceived psychopathology, and the addicted individual was viewed as being less at fault for their weight compared to when obesity was attributed to personal control and personal choice around diet and exercise. Furthermore, more widespread belief that certain food products can be addictive may increase the populations support for policies intended to curb their use, as well as support of individual patients who want to try abstinence-based food plans by family and friends.\r\nMaybe it wont change much at all\r\nIts also possible that this construct will not affect negative attitudes towards people who struggle with weight or self-blame, as supported by a recent survey of people from the United States and Australia which found that viewpoints attributing obesity to food addition did not alter weight-based stigma.\r\nAlthough the jury is still out on the impact of the label, research increasingly indicates that certain foods act on the brain in similar ways as drugs of abuse. Anecdotally, Ive observed mostly positive effects of introducing the food addiction concept to patients, especially when it has generated more discussion about treatment options not yet tried (e.g., medications, abstinence-based food plans).

"{'Menthol cigarettes and cigars would be banned from sale under two proposed rules released Thursday, marking a long-awaited step in the FDAs efforts to address tobacco-related health disparities.\r\nThe Food and Drug Administration issued new product standards targeting menthol and other flavored tobacco products that can make smoking harder to quit, especially among youth. These products are often disproportionately used by Black Americans and other minority groups. \r\nWe need a care package to help them quit. People dont realize that the addictiveness of nicotine ranks right up there with opioids, FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said Thursday at a hearing.\r\nThe first proposed rule (\r\nRIN 0910-AI60) would prohibit tobacco manufacturers and retailers from making, distributing, and selling cigarettes containing menthol as a flavor. The second (\r\nRIN 0910-AI28) would ban all characterizing flavors, including menthol, in cigars. Both need to be finalized after a public comment period.\r\nThe move is a potential boon for public health if it causes menthol smokers to quit or deters people from taking up cigarettes in the first place. Its also a blow to cigarette makers that are already struggling with declining sales, as well as governments that rely on tax income from cigarettes.\r\nAround 37% of cigarettes sold in 2020 were menthol, up from 34% in 2015, according to data from the Federal Trade Commission. Companies that would be hurt by a menthol ban include \r\nAltria Group Inc., \r\nImperial Brands Plc, which makes Kool cigarettes, and \r\nBritish American Tobacco Plc.\r\nTobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death and disease in the United States. Menthols flavor and sensory effects increase appeal and make menthol cigarettes easier to use, particularly among youth and young adults, the FDA said in the proposed rule for cigarettes.\r\nThe agency said the product standard for cigars would reduce the appeal particularly for young adults and thereby decrease the likelihood of experimentation, development of nicotine dependence, and progression to regular use.\r\nLong-Awaited Plan\r\nIn April 2021, the agency \r\nannounced that it would pursue the menthol bans as part of its efforts to reduce disease and death caused by combusted tobacco product use. Menthol flavoring gives cigarettes a minty taste and soothes the throat, but the FDA has warned that it can also make smoking more addictive and appealing.\r\nThe FDA has previously said that it wouldnt impose penalties on individual consumers who possess or use menthol-containing products, while still ensuring that no new unlawful cigarette or cigar products are added to the market. \r\nAnti-tobacco groups, like the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, \r\napplauded the FDA on its plans, but cigarette makers have pushed back. \r\nAltria has argued that smokers will keep using regular cigarettes or move to black-market products if there arent enough desirable alternatives to menthol available.\r\nWhen finalized, the cigarette menthol ban will be the single most significant action that the FDA has taken on tobacco, Erika Sward, assistant vice president of national advocacy at the American Lung Association, said.\r\nHealth Equity\r\nNearly 85% of all non-Hispanic Black smokers report using menthol cigarettes, compared with just 30% of non-Hispanic White smokers, according to the FDA. The agency has also said that in 2020, the 30-day cigar smoking levels for non-Hispanic Black high school students were twice as high as White students.\r\nFor decades the tobacco industry has deliberately targeted Black communities with marketing for menthol cigarettes, with tragic consequences. The industry also uses these flavored products to lure kids into a deadly addiction, said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.\r\nThese rules will, once and for all, put an end to these predatory and deadly practices, Myers said in a statement.\r\nThe FDA has been reviewing the use of menthol in cigarettes since the passage of the 2009 Tobacco Control Act, which banned characterizing flavors in cigarettes but didnt include menthol. That law helped to fuel a sharp increase in flavored cigar use, especially among youth and racial minority populations, according to the FDA.\r\nFlavored cigars were marketed as a starter product, particularly in black communities, Sward said.\r\nFor far too long, specific populations have been targeted and disproportionately impacted by tobacco use, especially when it comes to characterizing flavors that entice them to start and keep smoking, then-Center for Tobacco Products Director Mitch Zeller, who retired earlier this month, said in \r\na January statement. \r\nMarket Issues\r\nNot everyone however is praising the FDAs move.\r\nTim Andrews, Americans for Tax Reforms director of consumer issues, called the FDAs proposal misguided, noting it will have disastrous impacts on public health and public safety while failing to curb smoking.\r\nIf the FDA were serious about reducing smoking rates, they would accept the science and follow the recommendation of over 100 of the worlds leading medical bodies to embrace reduced risk tobacco alternatives, such as e-cigarettes, which have been proven 95% safer than combustible cigarettes, Andrews said in a statement.\r\nThis proposed rulemaking will inevitably lead to further growth of illicit markets, put members of minority communities in danger, and divert law enforcement resources away from real crime, he added.\r\nThe FDA is currently reviewing vape products that are already on the market, and deciding whether they are appropriate for the protection of public health and can remain on shelves. Its highly-anticipated decision on products made by \r\nJuul Labs Inc. is expected at any time.\r\nA federal menthol ban may cost the U.S. government $6.6 billion in lost excise taxes, which can represent up to 40% of the cigarettes retail price, according to a March report from the \r\nTax Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on tax policy. \r\nThat potential loss is still just a fraction of what the government might save if the menthol ban leads to fewer smokers, however. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \r\nestimates that smoking-related illnesses cost the U.S. more than $300 billion a year, including $5.6 billion alone due to second-hand smoke exposure.\r\nMichael R.

"{'Potentially life-saving medication will be made readily available at hundreds of sites across New Hampshire as part of a public health initiative to curb the opioid crisis, state officials announced Tuesday.\r\nThe plan is to install a NaloxBox in more than 700 public places across all 10 counties in a coordinated effort involving the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services and the states partners in substance misuse prevention, officials said.\r\nThe hard acrylic boxes will contain naloxone, a medication that can block the toxic effects of opioid overdoses. The boxes will be mounted to exterior walls to offer round-the-clock public access, while also working to reduce the stigma associated with opioid overdoses, officials said.\r\nThe publicly available naloxone will add to the resources already provided by groups like the New Hampshire Harm Reduction Coalition, which operates an overdose prevention van and runs weekly programs in Concord, Manchester, Rochester, Dover, and Somersworth. The group reported that its participants reversed 1,459 drug overdoses statewide in 2022.\r\nStill, the states Office of Chief Medical Examiner reported 463 confirmed drug overdose deaths in 2022. Most were accidental, and most were caused by opioids.\r\nHealth and Human Services Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Ballard said lives are saved when naloxone is administered at the first sign of an overdose.\r\nDuring a medical emergency, every minute counts, and providing public access to life-saving medication that can reverse the impact of an overdose while it is occurring is a critical step in reducing the number of lives lost to substance use disorder, Ballard said in a statement.\r\nGovernor Chris Sununu, a Republican, said these boxes will be yet another tool in New Hampshires efforts to build a robust treatment and recovery system, while prevention remains the states top goal.\r\nAny business or community entity can request a NaloxBox unit to install in an accessible and highly visible area, officials said. Businesses or organizations can contact state opioid response director Jennifer Sabin at Jennifer.A.Sabin@dhhs.nh.gov.\r\nOthers who would like to access naloxone for individual purposes, including first responders, families, and caregivers, can contact their local Doorway location.\r\nOfficials said they will work with the states 13 regional public health networks, the Harm Reduction Coalition, and Recovery Friendly Workplace locations to distribute the units. Those that receive a NaloxBox unit will be responsible for monitoring it and requesting refills.\r\nThis wont be the first time a NaloxBox has been installed in New Hampshire. The units have been placed at individual sites in the Granite State and elsewhere.

"{'Responding to a backlash from pain patients, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released updated guidelines Thursday that offer clinicians more flexibility in the way they prescribe opioids for short- and long-term pain.\r\nThe new recommendations eliminate numerical dose limits and caps on length of treatment for chronic pain patients that had been suggested in the landmark 2016 version of the agencys advice, which was aimed at curbing the liberal use of the medication and controlling a rampaging opioid epidemic. Those guidelines cautioned doctors that commencing opioid therapy was a momentous decision for patients.\r\nParts of that nonbinding document were widely misinterpreted, resulting in unintended harm to patients who were benefiting from use of opioids without much risk of addiction. Patients reported they were rapidly tapered off medication by doctors or saw their medication abruptly discontinued, the CDC acknowledged in the new document. Some insurers and pharmacies set rigid limits on duration of prescriptions or dropped patients altogether.\r\nThe new 100 pages of guidance which remain only recommendations for doctors, nurse practitioners, and others authorized to prescribe opioids emphasize returning the focus to the caregiver and patient deciding on the best course of treatment.\r\nThis guideline is really intended to be a mechanism to help patients and providers work together, Christopher Jones, acting director of CDCs National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, said in an interview Thursday. We have leaned in on more principles, rather than thresholds.\r\nThough a record 107,000 Americans died of opioid overdoses in 2021, much about the epidemic has changed since 2016. The number of prescriptions for opioids, which peaked at more than 255 million in 2012, was still at nearly 215 million when the CDC released the first set of guidelines.\r\nBy 2020, that number had declined to 142 million, a reflection of efforts to reduce opioid use in favor of other approaches to pain and a recognition that many addictions begin with prescribed medication.\r\nThe ongoing overdose epidemic is now caused mainly by illegal fentanyl, which is laced into a wide variety of street drugs and consumed, sometimes unknowingly, by users.\r\nYet chronic pain defined as pain that lasts more than three months remains one of the most common conditions suffered by US patients. In 2019, 1 in 5 adults reported chronic pain, and 1 in 14 said it limited life or work activities, according to the CDC. Chronic pain is blamed for $560 billion to $635 billion in direct medical costs, lost productivity, and disability each year, and contributes to 9 percent of suicides, the agency said.\r\nThe new recommendations were proposed in February and sent out for comment from the public and experts before being adopted by the CDC. They took into account research on opioids conducted since 2016. Like the previous version, they are not intended for treatment of pain from sickle cell disease and cancer, or palliative and end-of-life care, which demand special consideration from caregivers.\r\nAt least one group had hoped the guidelines would retain numerical caps in one of the boldfaced recommendations for prescribers. In a March 25 letter, Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, one of the fiercest critics of liberal opioid use, advised highlighting a cap of 50 morphine milligram equivalents as the daily line at which prescribers are likely to face diminishing returns. That number is noted deeper in the guidance.\r\nLike the previous guidelines, the new version recommends that caregivers try non-opioid approaches to pain control before initiating the medication. They also note disparity in the care of people of color, some of whom are less likely to be referred to a pain specialist or receive postpartum pain assessments than white people. Black people also receive lower doses of pain medication than their white peers.\r\nThe new recommendations also include advice on ways doctors and patients can discuss tapering off drugs; a warning that clinicians should weigh benefits and risks and exercise care when changing opioid dosage; and a notice that they should regularly reevaluate benefits and risks of continued opioid therapy with patients.\r\nIn no way is there an intent that they be applied as a one-size-fits-all, Jones said. These are just guideposts.': ""{{'PERSON': ['Christopher Jones'], 'DATE': ['Thursday', '2016', '2021', '2012', '2020', '2019', 'February', 'March 25'], 'LOC': ['US'], 'ORG': ['Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'CDCs National Center for Injury Prevention and Control', 'CDC', 'Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing'], 'PROGRAMS': ['updated guidelines for opioids prescription'], 'IMPACT': ['more flexibility in the way they prescribe opioids', 'eliminate numerical dose limits and caps on length of treatment for chronic pain patients', 'reduce opioid use in favor of other approaches to pain', 'advice on ways doctors and patients can discuss tapering off drugs']}}""}"
"{'President Joe Biden will meet with Mexican officials Monday\xa0to discuss how to stop\xa0illicit drugs from coming through the southern\xa0border, a problem that continues to fuel a new wave of the deadly fentanyl\xa0crisis\xa0across the United States.\r\nCONTEXT: There were\xa0107,622 drug overdose deaths in 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and\xa0two-thirds of those\xa0deaths were caused by\xa0fentanyl, a synthetic opioid.\r\nMost\xa0illicit fentanyl is mass-produced in ""secret factories"" in Mexico with chemicals obtained from China, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.\r\nFentanyl is highly addictive,\xa050 times more potent than heroin, and only a tiny amount enough to rest on a pencil tip can be fatal.\r\n""Fentanyl is making its way everywhere and into everything,"" said Nick Stavros, CEO of Community Medical Services. Today, the state of Arizona averages 4.5 drug overdoses a day, which is one of the highest overdose rates in the United States. ""It is becoming a huge problem in the state of Arizona,"" said Stavros.\r\nHere\'s what health researchers and overdose prevention workers say are the top solutions to\xa0curb fentanyl addiction and overdose deaths in the United States:\r\nMore medications needed to\xa0treat opioid addiction\r\nPeople who use opioids\xa0need different\xa0exits points and off ramps to get off the drugs, said Susan Sherman, a health behavior professor at the\xa0John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Maryland.\r\nWhether illicit fentanyl is ""sourced from Mexico or whether its sourced\xa0from China, the issue is here with consumption, with lack of scaled-up evidence-based medication-assisted drug treatment,"" Sherman said.\r\nOnly a\xa0small fraction\xa0 roughly 10%\xa0 of people with an opioid addiction\xa0are on medication to treat it, according to\xa0Joseph Friedman, a substance use researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles.\r\n""So there\'s just this huge unmet need, and that\'s an uncontroversial point of failure of our drug policy,"" he said.\r\nUnequal access to health care\xa0means many people have no way to get the life-saving medication, unlike more widely available, government-funded treatment programs for other epidemics, like HIV, he said.\r\nFriedman said the government and the health care system should especially work to make Buprenorphine, which\xa0has ""historically been prescribed to middle and upper class white people,"" more accessible and affordable.\xa0Unlike other treatments that must\xa0be administered\xa0at a clinic each day, Buprenorphine is the first opioid addiction treatment that can be dispensed by family doctors and everyday pharmacies, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\r\nIt\'s not hard to accidentally consume fentanyl.\r\nIllicit drug tablets\xa0laced with fentanyl are often being disguised to look like prescription pain-relief pills. Many\xa0non-opioid drugs including marijuana and\xa0cocaine can\xa0contain fentanyl, unbeknownst to people who use it.\r\nRecent research has\xa0pointed to overwhelming racial disparities\xa0in\xa0synthetic opioid deaths, with mortality rates for Black people more than tripling from 2010-2019, compared to an increase of 58% for non-Hispanic whites.\r\n\'TRASH CANS\': Fentanyl laced with animal tranquilizer fuels already dangerous pill crisis\r\nMore tests are needed to check for fentanyl\r\nAcross the country, people with opioid addictions who use illicit drugs rely on\xa0fentanyl\xa0test strips to know if the substance they\'re about to take\xa0contains fentanyl.\r\n""Imagine you went to a bar and ordered a drink and you don\'t know if they made your cocktail with a tenth of a shot of alcohol or ten shots of alcohol, and the only way you can figure that out is by starting to drink and see how you feel,"" Friedman said.\r\nThe strips use\xa0the same technology as workplace drug tests, they\'re\xa0cheap and they\xa0prevent overdoses\xa0because the fentanyl they\xa0detect is so potent.\r\n""There\'s\xa0all these things that would be great to avoid, so drug checking is a very common sense way to reduce the harm of a really, really toxic drug market,"" Friedman said.\r\nBut the paper test strips, which are considered drug paraphernalia, are illegal\xa0according to\xa0laws on the books in nearly every state\xa0intended to crack down on illicit drugs.\r\nDrug paraphernalia laws\xa0make people who use illicit drugs fearful of seeking help to do so safely because ""theyre viewed as criminals,""\xa0said Alex Kral, an epidemiologist and drug policy expert at the non-profit Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina.\r\nBesides test strips, a small number of U.S. harm reduction programs have machines called Fourier-transform infrared\xa0spectrometers that can test a drug\xa0and detect every substance it contains and its concentration.\r\nIf more places in the United States\xa0could access the machines, Kral said, they could\xa0serve as a surveillance system to alert\xa0the community when dangerous substances enter the supply of drugs.\r\nIf\xa0youre continually testing peoples drugs, you get a sense about whats in the drug supply in general in the city, or neighborhood or town,"" Kral said.\r\n379 million deadly doses: In 2022 the DEA seized enough fentanyl to kill every American\r\n""Rainbow fentanyl"" pills found at the Nogales Port of Entry in Arizona.\r\nWhat are overdose prevention centers?\r\nVulnerable people\'s lives are at risk every day, Kral said, because opioid addiction and overdoses stem from poverty, poor mental health and the availability of contaminated drugs. It\'s important people on the margins of society have a ""trusted"" place they can go to use drugs more safely, he said.\r\nIn New York City, two sanctioned safe consumption sites allow people who use drugs to test them for fentanyl without worrying about getting arrested.

"{""I direct one of the largest addiction research centers in the country, and I study substance use in adolescence. Heres what every parent needs to know about adolescent substance use:\r\n1. Adolescence is the time when most kids initiate substance use.\r\nIt's when they establish regular patterns of use, and many start to experience consequences. About 15 percent of the population will meet the criteria for a substance use disorder at some point in their lives, meaning that substance use is causing significant harmful consequences. The average age of onset for problems is in the early 20s, so most problems start in adolescence. Thats why we focus so much substance use prevention programming on teens.\r\n2. Adolescents have brains that are wired for risk-taking.\r\nThis is a result of the fact that the brain doesnt develop evenly. The part of the brain that is highly attuned to experiencing reward is fully developed in adolescence. Thats a product of evolutionif our brains didnt respond positively to food, social interactions, and sex, as a species, we wouldnt survive very long. Those things make us feel good, and we seek out more of them.\r\nBut as we all know, too much of a good thing can lead to trouble. The part of our brain that helps us weigh the consequences of our actions and think about long-term implications isnt fully developed until the mid-20s. So, teenagers are like race cars without fully functional brakes. Using drugs is a novel experience that adolescent brains craveand then drugs hijack the reward system by producing feel-good effects. Its a big part of the reason why most adolescent substance use is risky adolescent substance use. Teens dont have a glass of wine with dinner; if one drink is good, their reward-primed brains tell them, five drinks must be better! Of course, there is a lot of individual variability in this trait, but developmentally, teenage brains are at a high point for risk-taking.\r\n3. The drugs available to kids today are more dangerous than in the past.\r\nVaping has risen tremendously in popularity, with one in four youths reporting that they have vaped. Vapes come in fun flavors and are easy to hide; most youth (and parents) do not realize that a single vape can contain as much nicotine as a pack of cigarettes.\r\nCannabis use is on the rise as most states have legalized marijuana for either medicinal or recreational purposes. Up to 11 percent of youth report using cannabis daily. This is the drug most of us who study adolescent substance use are most worried about presently.\r\nThe marijuana available today is nearly 10 times stronger than the marijuana that was available in the 70s, 80s, 90s, and up through the 2000s. Early research is showing potent adverse effects on memory and motivation in kids who use regularly. The level of THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, was about 3 percent until the early 2000s; it is now close to 25 percent in the marijuana available today, and up to 90 percent in edibles like gummies! Many parents are unaware of just how different and dangerous this drug is compared to how they remember marijuana. Parents, think of it this way: If marijuana use in your youth was the equivalent of having a beer, when your kids use marijuana, its more like drinking a liter of vodka.\r\nFentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid which can be produced far more cheaply than other opioids, has flooded the drug market as a result of the opioid epidemic. It is the top cause of accidental overdoses, which have grown exponentially over the past several years. The concern now is that its not only opioids that are laced with fentanyl; its other drugs as well. Increasingly, cocaine, ecstasy, and other street drugs also contain fentanyl, leading to accidental overdoses in youth who experiment.\r\n4. Alcohol remains the most widely used drug in youth.\r\nIt is the most available drug, so it continues to be the one most kids use recklessly, leading to injuries, fights, unwanted sexual behavior and assaults, accidents, and death. Well-meaning parents have asked me if, due to the increasing availability of more dangerous drugs, they should instead encourage their child to take the least-worse path and stick to alcohol.\r\nThere are two reasons this isnt a good idea. First, it assumes that all kids will use alcohol or other drugs, which is not the case. We dont want to inadvertently normalize substance use in our kids. Many youth choose not to drink. Rates of alcohol use have fallen steadily over the past decade, with national data showing that only 55 percent of high school seniors report using alcohol in the past year.\r\nSecondly, there is no evidence that when youth use alcohol it deters them from using other drugs. In fact, the opposite is true. Youth who use alcohol are more likely to try other drugs as well. When the novelty of alcohol wears off (remember they have sensation-seeking brains!), they move on to trying other drugs.\r\n5. Parents can make a difference.\r\nParents, dont despair! There are actions you can take to reduce the likelihood your teen will initiate substance use or use in risky ways.\r\n<ul><li>Monitor your kids. Know who they are with, where they are going, what they are up to. Remove easy access to alcohol in your house. Parental monitoring is the number-one thing that research shows reduces substance use in teens. Kids cant use alcohol and other drugs if they dont have access. You can make it harder for them to get access. Remember, their brains arent in a place to help them make the best choices; you have to make up the difference.</li><li>Talk to your kids about alcohol and other drugs. Ask your child questions about substance use in their school and among their friends. Ask what they think about using alcohol or other drugs. Use this as an opportunity to have a conversation about substance use. Be clear about the rules and expectations in your house, andthis part is keyoutline and implement consequences if they are broken. Its normal for teens to push boundaries, and the unfun part of being a parent is that we have to serve as the referees. But unfortunately, this isnt a game; your childs life is at stake.</li></ul>"": ""{{'PERSON': ['None'], 'DATE': ['None'], 'LOC': ['None'], 'ORG': ['None'], 'PROGRAMS': ['addiction research centers', 'substance use prevention programming', 'vaping', 'cannabis use'], 'IMPACT': ['increase in addiction problems in adolescents', 'rise in dangerous drugs', 'accidental overdoses', 'unwanted sexual behavior', 'assaults', 'accidents', 'death', 'youth alcohol use']}}""}"
"{'In a year of so much loss, she savored this sense of joy. And she wanted to help her patients, and anyone trying to overcome drug addiction, to be able to experience it, too.\r\nThat wish inspired Barreveld to help create the newest landmark along the Boston Marathon route: a 2,104-flag memorial to the Massachusetts residents who died from opioid overdoses last year. The display will stretch across the hospitals front lawn on Route 16.\r\nIt all intersected for me. It reminds me that Im not running for myself, said Barreveld, an anesthesiologist who is running the marathon for SOAR, a Natick-based support group for parents of children suffering from opioid addiction. Every time I feel that sensation, I feel more excited to have the opportunity.\r\nThe display was sponsored bySOAR and the hospitals Substance Use Services program, which Barreveld and her colleague Dr. Catharina Armstrong founded in 2017.\r\nWith the arrival of the pandemic last year, opioid-related deaths increased by the highest single-year percentage since 1999, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Massachusetts remains an epicenter of the crisis, with a death toll among the nations highest.\r\nThe death toll continues to climb amid the economic devastation and social isolation caused by the pandemic and as efforts to strengthen the states treatment services stall. Theres an urgent need to improve access to care and reduce the greatest barrier to seeking help:the stigma around addiction, the doctors said.\r\nBarreveld and Armstong said they hope the sea of purple and red flags willbring attention to the magnitude of the opioid epidemic and encourage open conversations about addiction among family and friends.\r\nArmstrong, the associate director of the Substance Use Service program and member of the Infectious diseases staff, said everyone is affected by addiction in some way. But shame, lack of education, and resources prevent many from seeking care.\r\nWe need to erase the stigma, said Armstrong, who is running to raise money for the Boston Bulldogs Running Club, which promotes recovery. We are not hiding behind the disease of addiction and were not hiding the increase in overdoses. The only way we can get to the root [of the problem] is to start talking about it.\r\nBarreveld said shes extremely proud that the hospital decided the display is something worthy of showing the world. For those affected by the epidemic, it will send a message of visibility and validation, she said.\r\nIts not only a sad moment, Barreveld said. Its an invigorating moment.\r\nAs the director of education and outreach on the Substance Use Service team, Barreveld has worked to change the language doctors and families use to discuss addiction.\r\nAddiction is a disease. Its not that our patients have committed a moral failure, or are not strong, or have an underlying mental illness, she said. Its a disease. And there is hope and treatment.\r\nAddressing addiction as a disease leads to more evidence-based treatment and reduces levels of personal guilt, she said. Many patients hesitate to seek help because they fear it will negatively impact their personal relationships or their employment, the doctors said.\r\nEach of these flags represents an opportunity to speak up and get help, Armstrong said.\r\nWhen Armstrong and Barreveld run by the memorial Monday, they expect to feel a rush of hope that will push them up Heartbreak Hill and carry them through the last 10 miles.\r\nI will remember that Im running for those who cant, Armstrong said.\r\nJulia Carlin can be reached at julia.carlin@globe.com.': ""{{'PERSON': ['Barreveld', 'Dr. Catharina Armstrong', 'Armstong', 'Armstrong', 'Julia Carlin'], \n'DATE': ['last year', '2017', 'last 10 miles', 'Monday'], \n'LOC': ['Boston', 'Massachusetts', 'Route 16', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention'], \n'ORG': ['SOAR', 'Infectious diseases staff', 'Boston Bulldogs Running Club', 'Substance Use Service team'], \n'PROGRAMS': ['Substance Use Services program'], \n'IMPACT': ['opioid-related deaths increased', 'death toll continues to climb', 'promotes recovery']}}""}"
"{'Over the past year, there have been a number of large settlements with pharmaceutical companies, medical distributors, and pharmacies to account for the harms caused by the overmarketing, distribution, and prescribing of opioids in the late 90s and 2000s. Most recently, Rite Aid reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with the state of West Virginia, and Walmart, CVS, and Walgreens were ordered to pay $650.5 million to two counties in Ohio. These are just some of thecases among dozens that have resulted in billions of dollars in payments to public coffers.\r\nAt the same time, cities and states across the country have made plans to open overdose prevention centers where people can bring pre-obtained substances to use under the presence of trained staff who can intervene in case of overdose. Two sites have opened in New York City and Rhode Island is making plans to open itsfirst site. Meanwhile, Safehouse, a proposed overdose prevention center, is in settlement talks with the Department of Justice to open a site in Philadelphia. The City of Somerville has shown interest in opening a site,but Governor Charlie Baker has refused to address the issue and the Legislature continues to drag its feet. All of this comes on the heels of the Biden administration indicating that it is interested in pursuing a harm-reduction approach,something the Trump administration actively worked against.\r\nWith such large sums of money being doled out, questions arise about the best way to use such funds. Thankfully many of the agreements thus far require the funds to be used to mitigate the overdose crisis, a shift from the 1990s tobacco settlement in which few funds ended up going toward smoking prevention.\r\nNew York City and Rhode Island have recently announced that they will allocate funds toward the operations of overdose prevention centers, allowing these sites more flexibility and freedom to operate than they would have with money from private sources and donations alone. Rhode Island is committing $2.25 million from the $20 million 2023 opioid settlement budget for overdose prevention centers alone.\r\nItsa critical moment for states and cities to approve and financially support these sites using settlement dollars. In 2021 alone, more than 107,000 people across the United States died of an overdose. Research in other countries has shown that overdose prevention centers save lives. Study after study has shown that these sites would save cities considerable amounts of money by preventing infections and fatal and nonfatal overdoses. They also reduce emergency calls, ambulance rides, and emergency department visits for overdoses and drug-related infections.\r\nFor instance, a study released in July by the Rhode Island Department of Health and our team at the Brown University School of Public Health found that one site in Providence has the potential to avert 261 ambulance runs, 244 emergency department visits, and 117 hospitalizations for overdoses in one year. This averted need for emergency care would end up saving more than $1 million annually. But beyond saved costs, reduced overdoses and infection mean a better quality of life for people who use drugs.\r\nOverdose prevention centers also serve as nexus points for naloxone distribution, syringe exchange, wraparound support services, and referrals to health care, housing, and treatment approving these sites and providing them with funds strengthens other harm-reduction and treatment strategies as well.\r\nHowever, running these sites requires real investment. Our study shows that one site in Providence could cost at least $700,000 a year to run. Apart from the costs of running a site and obtaining equipment, its important to recognize that this work like all front-line harm-reduction work is not easy and can expose staff to potentially traumatizing and difficult scenarios. Providing substantial and stable funding that fairly compensates overdose prevention center staff and provides medical and ancillary benefits is essential to ensure staff are adequately supported. Too often, harm-reduction organizations are asked to do this work with shoestring budgets that can barely cover operational costs and yet are asked to play a key role in our societys response to the overdose crisis. Supporting them adequately will mean increases far beyond what states currently provide.\r\nCity and state governments have made slow but important progress in opening overdose prevention centers across parts of the country; however, we are still in the midst of a massive public health crisis and only two sanctioned sites are operating nationwide. For these sites to be as effective as they can be, there needs to be multiple locations and models. More research needs to be undertaken to understand how these centers can operate most effectively in both large urban centers and smaller urban and rural communities.\r\nFinally, we cannot ignore the disproportionate toll the overdose crisis has taken on people of color Black and Indigenous people specifically have faced steep increases in overdose deaths over the past few years and these communities often face barriers to treatment. Previous data on access to treatment show people having differential access to methadone and buprenorphine along lines of racial and ethnic segregation for instance. Since overdose prevention centers provide wraparound services that include access to treatment, its essential that they be accessible, including on-site multilingual staff and support for safe inhalation of substances as not everyone injects drugs.\r\nOpioid settlement funding provides a critical opportunity to turn the tide on overdose deaths. Policymakers across the nation must fund overdose prevention centers as part of a comprehensive and evidence-based response to this crisis.\r\nAbdullah Shihipar directs narrative projects and policy impact initiatives at the People, Place &amp; Health Collective at Brown University School of Public Health.

"{'Several states also alleged that Endo falsely promoted the benefits of Opana ERs so-called abuse-deterrent formulation. Neronha said this formula did nothing to deter oral abuse, but instead led to deadly outbreaks of Hepatitis and HIV due to its widespread abuse via injection.\r\nThe agreement, which is contingent on the bankruptcy courts approval, says Endo will be required to make payments of $450 million in cash over 10 years to participating states. Endo will have to turn over its opioid-related documents so that they are published online in a public document archive another $2.75 million fee for archival expenses, Neronha said.\r\nThe settlement also bans the marketing of all opioids made by Endo forever.\r\nIts unclear how much Rhode Islands share of the settlement would be worth. Rhode Island and the other 35 states shares will be determined once documents are finalized and court approvals are obtained, Brian Hodge, a spokesman in Neronhas office, told the Globe.\r\nEndo, which has its U.S. headquarters in Pennsylvania, also makes generic and branded opioids like Percocet and Endocet.\r\nThis office continues to pursue opioid manufacturers, distributors, and consultants all with a singular goal in mind: hold those companies accountable for deceptively peddling highly addictive narcotics to Rhode Islanders, said Neronha in a statement. What todays settlement means is that additional money will come to our state to support opioid abatement efforts.\r\nPrior to this settlement with Endo, Neronha the states top prosecutor has secured more than $220 million from previous opioid litigation and settlements, including $90.8 million from pharmaceutical distributors McKesson, Cardinal Health, and AmerisourceBergen over 18 years. The dollars are then administered to help fund life-saving medication for Rhode Islands opioid prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts.\r\nThese resources are in the process of being delivered and distributed for opioid prevention, treatment, and recovery, said Neronha, who previously told the Globe that he has met with survivors and loved ones of those impacted by the opioid crisis in preparation for these suits. This is only the beginning, and more work remains to right the wrongs in our community, and this office is committed to the task.\r\nIn 2017, Endo pulled Opana from the market at the request of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The drug, which is oxymorphone hydrochloride, was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2006 for moderate-to-severe pain. The company had replaced the original formula of Opana ER with a new formula that was intended to make the drug resistant to physical and chemical manipulation for abuse by snorting or injecting it. It met regulatory standards for approval at the time, but the FDA later found that data did not show that the new formula was actually reducing abuse.\r\nIn a statement announcing their chapter 11 proceedings, Endos president and CEO Blaise Coleman said the bankruptcy filing process will enable us to continue our ongoing business transformation, including investing in our core areas of growth, as we work to execute a transaction to strengthen our balance sheet and secure a strong tomorrow.\r\nIn a letter to stakeholders, Coleman, who previously worked for pharmaceutical companies AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson, wrote the restructuring process would substantially reduce our debt and address opioid-related and other claims without the need for continued costly, time-consuming litigation.\r\nEach state in New England joined the settlement, but Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont, and New Hampshire are among the seven states that led negotiations.\r\nEndos deceptive marketing fueled the opioid crisis and caused a massive human toll, said Massachusetts Attorney General Maura T.

"{'New Hampshire had begun to see progress in its efforts to reduce the number of people dying from opioids and other drugs. The states overdose death tally decreased two years in a row. But that was before the pandemic.\r\nNow the trendline has reversed.\r\nThe number of drug overdose deaths in New Hampshire rose 11 percent last year, to 486, nearly reaching the grim record the state had set four years earlier, according to an updated report from the Chief Medical Examiners office.\r\nThe report attributes the bulk of the deaths to fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid that has been fueling concerns about overdoses nationwide.\r\nDr. Jonathan Ballard, chief medical officer for the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, said imported fentanyl continues to cause havoc on New Hampshire residents and families, despite the states proven progress on prevention, treatment, and recovery services.\r\nIt is more critical than ever that residents have access to the tools and services that can prevent addiction overdoses and support their path to recovery, Ballard said, noting that the state offers substance abuse treatment options, the opioid overdose-reversing drug Naloxone, and other resources through the Doorways program.\r\nAfter rising dramatically in 2014 and continuing to climb thereafter, the number of overdose deaths in New Hampshire peaked at 490 in 2017, then fell modestly the following two years, according to the medical examiners report.\r\nThe promising fall in drug deaths in 2018 and 2019 ended with the COVID-19 pandemic, plateauing in 2020 and rising again in 2021 and 2022, the report states.\r\nWhile New Hampshire came close to matching its previous record, all three states that border it Vermont, Maine, and Massachusetts appear to have set new records in 2022.\r\nThe drug overdose mortality rate was lower in New Hampshire than in its neighboring states in 2020 and 2021, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Comparative data was not yet available for 2022.\r\nNew Hampshires most populous cities and counties saw the highest numbers of overdose deaths in 2022, but some rural parts of the state, including Coos County, were especially hard hit on a per capita basis.\r\nIn Rockingham County, where about 319,500 people live, there were 67 deaths. Thats roughly 2.1 deaths per 10,000 residents. \r\nIn Coos County, where about 31,500 people live, there were 23 deaths recorded in 2022.

"{'Millions of Americans have turned to kratom, an over-the-counter herbal drug extracted from the leaves of a tree native to Southeast Asia, for relief of pain, anxiety and even withdrawal symptoms from opioids.\r\nBut the Food and Drug Administration has said kratom may be harmful. The agency has sought to restrict imports of the substance and recently seized a large shipment to an Oklahoma manufacturer.\r\nStill, millions of users regularly buy kratom as pills, capsules or other forms at convenience stores and smoke shops.\r\nMore: Kratom supplier owes millions to family of South Florida nurse who overdosed and died\r\nHere\'s what to know about kratom, its side effects, how it\'s sold and its legality.\r\nWhat is kratom?\r\nKratom is extracted from the leaves of Mitragyna speciosa, a tree native to Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. The products are marketed as herbal supplements that users claim relieve pain, boost energy, treat anxiety and ease withdrawal symptoms from opioids.\r\nThe FDA said kratom contains psychoactive ingredients and binds to the same opioid brain receptors as morphine. The agency says the unregulated substance appears to put users at risk of addiction and abuse.\r\nA trade group, the American Kratom Association, disputes the claim and says the FDA has ""unfairly demonized"" kratom for more than a decade.\r\nKratom is a naturally occurring herbal extract that comes from leaves of an evergreen grown in Southeast Asia. It can be chewed as well as swallowed in gel cap form, or brewed as a tea or mixed in another liquid.\r\nWhat are kratom\'s side effects?\r\nThe FDA hasn\'t approved kratom for therapeutic use and has warned consumers of ""concerning reports about the safety of kratom.""\r\nThough the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) have called for more research on long-term effects of kratom, the federal agencies said the substance is linked to known harms and can create opioid- and stimulant-like effects.\r\nAccording to NIDA, unregulated products marketed as kratom might be contaminated with heavy metals and harmful bacteria.\r\nPeople have experienced side effects such as agitation, confusion, sedation, hallucinations, seizures and liver toxicity, according to a 2021 World Health Organization\'s expert committee on drug dependence report. People have also had heart problems, depressed breathing, stomach pain, nausea and vomiting.\r\nA 2019 study examining cases reported by poison control centers linked 11 deaths in the U.S. to kratom from 2011 to 2017. Two of those deaths ""occurred after exposure to kratom only,"" the study found.\r\nThe CDC reported autopsies of 152 people who died of overdose between July 2016 and December 2017 tested positive for kratom, but the vast majority of those deaths involved people taking multiple substances, including fentanyl, heroin and cocaine.\r\nBattle over delta-8 is heating up. Here\'s what to know about the \'diet weed.\'\r\nDependence is a risk because kratom has opiate-like effects, said Dr. Alan Kaye, professor of anesthesiology and pharmacology at Louisiana State University in Shreveport.\r\n""You don\'t have to be a pharmacologist like I am to know that giving out an unregulated opiate agonist can be a problem in terms of abuse, addiction and overdose,"" Kaye said. ""Does that sound like something that should be unregulated and sold at your gas station?""\r\nIs kratom legal?\r\nKratom is sold as a nutritional supplement, and the FDA can shut down marketers who make therapeutic claims to get consumers to purchase their products. Last decade, the FDA issued two import alerts that allows the agency to seize kratom shipped to the United States as a dietary supplement or bulk ingredient.\r\nThe agency has periodically confiscated shipments. Last month, the FDA announced U.S. marshals seized a quarter-million kratom products and 1,000 kilograms of bulk ingredients made by Botanic Tonics LLC in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma. In 2021, federal authorities seized from a Florida manufacturer 34,000 kilograms of bulk kratom and products sold under brand names such as Boosted Kratom, Devils Kratom and El Diablo. The FDA secured a court order to destroy the products, which were worth about $1.3 million.\r\nBut nine states have passed legislation modeled after the kratom consumer protection act, which includes labeling requirements and restricts sales to minors. Those states are Utah, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Colorado, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Virginia, according to the American Kratom Association.\r\nAlabama, Arkansas, Wisconsin, Indiana, Vermont and Rhode Island banned kratom products last decade, but the association has petitioned some of those states to reconsider. The association said these states relied on information from the FDA, which unsuccessfully sought to schedule the drug as a narcotic.\r\nMac Haddow, a senior fellow on public policy at the American Kratom Association, said the industry has tried to self-police by warning manufacturers to avoid therapeutic claims. The association has referred details of more than 75 companies for potentially running afoul of federal rules by making unsupported therapeutic claims, but the FDA hasn\'t pursued action against those companies, Haddow said.\r\nMore: $3M in kratom seized from Oklahoma manufacturer, company faces class action lawsuit\r\nIs kratom an opioid substitute?\r\nThough kratom has long been used in Southeast Asia for centuries, the substance has become more popular in the United States over the past two decades. One study estimated 10 million to 16 million Americans regularly use kratom.\r\nNIDA cited studies finding people use kratom to alleviate pain, anxiety and depression. Others use it as a replacement for opioids or to manage withdrawal symptoms.\r\nIn one survey of more than 8,000 kratom users, nearly 68% said they used the substance to treat pain and 66% to address emotional or mental conditions.\r\nHaddow cited studies that showed people use kratom to reduce dependence on opioids.\r\n""Others use it like a cup of coffee for energy-boosting or to refocus,"" Haddow said. ""Some people use it to get rid of anxiety or depression symptoms.""\r\nShots of white kratom tea sit on the bar at Island Root Kava Bar in Jensen Beach, Florida. Kratom tea is made by brewing leaves of the kratom tree. Friday, Aug. 26, 2022\r\nCapsules, tea or powder? How kratom is ingested\r\nThough kratom is often sold as pills or capsules in retail stores, some use it as a powder to mix in drinks. Others brew kratom leaves as a tea or ingest in a liquid form.\r\nBecause kratom is not regulated, users really don\'t know how much they are taking.\r\n""It\'s not standardized, like any drug would be from the FDA,"" Kaye said. ""There can be adulterants, blood concentration to be too low for therapeutic (effect) and there can be side effects and drug interactions.""\r\nKratom and pregnancy: What to know\r\nNIDA reports little research has been done on kratom use before, during or after pregnancy. A 2021 study found at least five cases of babies born with an opioid-like dependency to mothers who used kratom but not opioids.\r\nStill, those who use kratom during pregnancy often use other substances, so ""the effects of kratom alone on pregnancy are difficult to determine without further research,"" NIDA reports.\r\nIs kratom withdrawal a concern?\r\nEarly research suggests users experience mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms when they stop regular use, and anonymous surveys of users suggest ""a minority of people report experiencing kratom-related withdrawal symptoms,"" NIDA reports.\r\nScientists say the main kratom ingredients mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine partly activate brain receptors that addictive drugs do.\r\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: What is kratom?

"{""The approved branded nasal spray from Gaithersburg, Maryland-based Emergent BioSolutions is the best-known form of naloxone.\r\nIt can reverse overdoses of opioids, including street drugs such as heroin and fentanyl and prescription versions including oxycodone.\r\nMaking naloxone available more widely is seen as a key strategy to control the nationwide overdose crisis, which has been linked to more than 100,000 U.S. deaths a year. The majority of those deaths are tied to opioids, primarily potent synthetic versions such as fentanyl that can take multiple doses of naloxone to reverse.\r\nAdvocates believe it's important to get naloxone to the people who are most likely to be around overdoses, including people who use drugs and their relatives.\r\nPolice and other first responders also often carry it.\r\nNarcan will become available over-the-counter by late summer, the company said.\r\nOther brands of naloxone and injectable forms will not yet be available over the counter, but they could be soon.\r\nThe nonprofit Harm Reduction Therapeutics Inc., which has funding from OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, has an application before the FDA to distribute its version of spray naloxone without a prescription.\r\nEven before the FDA's action, pharmacies could sell naloxone without a prescription because officials in every state have allowed it.\r\nBut not every pharmacy carries it. And buyers have to pay for the medication either with an insurance co-pay or for the full retail price. The cost varies, but two doses of Narcan often go for around $50.\r\nThe drug is also distributed by community organizations that serve people who use drugs, though its not easily accessible to everyone who needs it.\r\nEmergent has not announced its price and it's not clear yet whether insurers will continue to cover it as a prescription drug if it's available over the counter.\r\nIt clears the way for Narcan to be made available in places without pharmacies convenience stores, supermarkets and online retailers, for instance.\r\nJose Benitez, the lead executive officer at Prevention Point Philadelphia, an organization that tries to reduce risk for people who use drugs with services including handing out free naloxone, said it could help a lot for people who don't seek services or who live in places where they're not available.\r\nNow, he said, some people are concerned about getting naloxone at pharmacies because their insurers will know they're getting it.\r\nPutting it out of the shelves is going to allows people just to pick it up, not have stigma attached to it and readily access this life-saving drug, he said.\r\nBut it remains to be seen how many stores will carry it and what the prices will be. The U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, which now cover prescription naloxone for people on the government insurance programs, says that coverage of over-the-counter naloxone would depend on the insurance program. The centers have not given any official guidance.\r\nMaya Doe-Simkins, a co-director of Remedy Alliance/For The People, which launched last year to provide low-cost and sometimes free naloxone to community organizations, said her group will continue to distribute injectable naloxone.\r\nOne concern is whether people who buy Narcan over-the-counter will know how to use it properly, said Keith Humphreys, a Stanford University addiction expert, though the manufacturer is responsible for clear directions and online videos on that.\r\nOne benefit of having pharmacists involved, he said, is that they can show buyers how to use it. One key thing people need to be reminded of: Call an ambulance for the person receiving naloxone after it's been administered.\r\nHe also said there are fears that if the drug isn't profitable as an over-the-counter option, the drugmaker could stop producing it.\r\n___\r\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"{'Its hard to find hope in these numbers, said Dr. Robert Goldstein, state commissioner of public health. [Deaths are] leveling off, but they are leveling off from the highest number of opioid-related overdose deaths that weve ever seen in the Commonwealth. And that is a really jarring, sobering number to have to report.\r\nPolicymakers, clinicians and outreach teams that work to prevent overdoses say the decades-long opioid epidemic has entered a perilous phase one that is more difficult to counteract.\r\nMore dangerous substances like fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, and xylazine, an animal tranquilizer known as tranq, are spreading through an ever-growing portion of the illicit drug supply. In many cases, people using stimulants such as cocaine or pills that resemble prescription painkillers are overdosing because they do not know they are laced with deadly amounts of fentanyl, treatment specialists and outreach workers say.\r\nAs the illicit drug supply becomes more contaminated, people seeking help to break their addictions face fewer treatment options. Medications like methadone and buprenorphine, which help reduce opioid cravings, are not effective for treating the use ofstimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine. And xylazine, which poses dangerous side effects including skin ulcers and depressed breathing, is resistant to fast-acting opioid-reversal drugs like Narcan.\r\nThe deadly drugs have become alarmingly easy to make and to hide. Last month, investigators seized more than 220 pounds of drugs many of them laced with lethal amounts of fentanyl from the basement of a multifamily home in Lynn. Many of the seized pills were molded to resemble pink Valentines Day candies.\r\nNow amateur chemists are mixing these ultra-deadly agents with every drug with counterfeit Adderall, with adulterated cocaine... and no one knows for sure what theyre taking, said Dr. James Baker, president of the Massachusetts Society of Addiction Medicine and a professor at Tufts School of Medicine. These agents can be produced anywhere.\r\nThe dangerous trend of combining illicit drugs, sometimes referred to as polysubstance use, is reflected in toxicology screens done on people who die of opioid overdoses. Cocaine was present in a record 60% of opioid-related overdose deaths statewide in the first three months of the year. Anti-anxiety medications known as benzodiazepines were present in 24% of those who died, and prescription opioids were found in 11% of deaths. Xylazine was present in 7% of deaths, state researchers found.\r\nMost of these drugs were combined with fentanyl, which is the driving force behind the relentless death toll, showing up in 93% of opioid-related deaths in the first three months of the year.\r\nThe ever-fluctuating blend of dangerous substances making their way into the illicit drug supply poses challenges for drug treatment counselors and others on the front-lines of the epidemic.\r\nAshley Oliveri, a clinician at an outpatient drug treatment clinic in Worcester operated by Spectrum Health Systems, said people seeking to wean themselves off opioids are needing ever-higher doses of methadone because illicit street drugs have become so potent. Often, the initial methadone dose prescribed by a doctor is too small, she said, to prevent painful withdrawal symptoms, which increases the risk of relapse.\r\nEvery few months, Oliveri has to update the information she shares with clients in group therapy sessions to keep pace with the growing risks and evolving nature of the illicit drug supply. Maybe 10 years ago, if you were going to pick up heroin, you knew you were getting heroin, she said. It wasnt safe but its a lot safer than whats on the street now.\r\nThe Commonwealth has poured $1.2 billion into addiction prevention, treatment and harm reduction programs since 2015, yet state officials acknowledged they need to do more to reverse the trend in overdose deaths and keep pace with the evolving epidemic.\r\nIn a significant break from past administrations, the Healey administration is publicly embracing supervised consumption sites.\r\nThese are special centers where people can use illicit drugs under the watchful eye of trained professionals, who can step in and rescue anyone who overdoses. Also known as overdose prevention centers, or OPCs, such sites have operated in Europe and Canada for more than 30 years, and a chorus of research studies has found they save lives, prevent infectious diseases and reduce harmful behaviors such as needle-sharing. Because of legal barriers, there are only two supervised drug consumption sites in the country, both in New York City, though another is scheduled to open early next year in Providence, R.I.\r\nThe Department of Public Health released a report Wednesday describing supervised consumption sites as feasible and necessary and recommended the state pass legislation that would shield supervised consumption providers, their staff and clients from criminal liability. It is [the Department of Public Healths] position that OPC activities are a life-saving intervention and a component of healthcare, and that these activities should be protected as such, the agency concluded in its report.\r\nThe Healey administration unveiled several other initiatives. These include a new public health campaign targeted at night-life venues and focused on the risks of unintended exposure to fentanyl, more funding for mobile addiction programs, and a research effort to identify so-called opioid treatment program deserts, or areas where people have limited access to methadone and other treatment services.\r\nIn September, Massachusetts became the first state to fund a 24-hour overdose prevention hotline. The hotline allows people taking drugs alone to be monitored during a phone call, and receive emergency medical care if they become unresponsive. From January to November, helpline staffsupervised more than 1,000 episodes in which people used drugs and helped prevent at least 9 overdoses, state officials said.\r\nYet such government-funded initiatives need to be combined with a broader campaign to educate the public and medical community about the life-saving benefits of addiction medicine, Dr. Baker argued.\r\nTwo days before Christmas in 2016, Dr. Baker lost his 23-year-old son Max, who was addicted to heroin, to a fatal overdose. He partly blames his sons doctors for not educating him about the nature of addiction and the availability of medications like buprenorphine, which bind to the brains opioid receptors long enough to prevent cravings. In his view, Massachusetts will not turn the corner on overdose deaths until the question, Are you or anyone else in your family suffering from addiction? becomes a standard question asked of every patient admitted to a clinic or hospital.\r\nNo one asked that about my son, and he was naked to the world, Dr. Baker said. Its a very hard thing to accept, at this stage, that there are still people out there who are dying without any help.\r\nChris Serres can be reached at chris.serres@globe.com.

While this led to an overall decline in emergency department visits, a recent study shows weekly trips to the ER for drug overdoses were higher in 2020 than in 2019.\r\nResearchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studied more than 180 million ER visits from Dec. 30, 2018, to Oct. 10, 2020, and found that weekly counts of all drug overdoses were up to 45% higher in 2020 than in 2019, according to the study published Feb. 3 in the peer-reviewed JAMA Psychiatry. Opioid overdoses, specifically, increased about 29% compared to before the pandemic.\r\nOverall visits to the emergency room plummeted when COVID-19 lockdown measures were implemented in March 2020, decreasing about 43% compared to the same timeframe in 2019. However, drug overdoses experienced only a slight decrease from March 29 to April 11, about 4% compared to 2019, before increasing again.\r\nThat all drug and opioid overdose emergency department visits did not decrease in a similar manner to other emergency department visits is especially compelling, suggesting an increase in overdose burden during the pandemic, study authors said.\r\nThe study comes a few months after the CDC alerted in December to an increase in drug overdose deaths that may have been accelerated by the pandemic, reporting more than 81,000 deaths in a 12-month period ending in May 2020, an 18.2% increase from the prior year. The agency said synthetic opioids are the primary driver of overdose deaths, increasing more than 38% compared to 12 months ending in June 2019.\r\nIm not surprised to see data like this come out, Dr. Patrick Marshalek, an addictions specialist and associate professor at West Virginia Universitys School of Medicine. The pandemic ""is breeding this and making it more likely to happen with a wide variety of substances.\r\nAnxiety, stress, depression and isolation induced by the pressures of the pandemic combined with a sudden lack of resources to seek treatment may have caused many people to relapse in their substance use disorder leading to an increase in overdoses in 2020, addiction experts say.\r\nThe deadliest year in US history: More than 3 million people died in 2020 due mainly to the coronavirus pandemic\r\n\'My beautiful boy is gone\': Dr. Laura Berman\'s 16-year-old son Samuel dies from overdose\r\nDr. Owen Lander, medical director of the West Virginia University Medicine J.W. Ruby Memorial Hospital Emergency Department, said he\'s seen an uptick of relapses in his emergency room as people with a long period of abstinence dont recognize their tolerance is much lower.\r\nHe speculated more relapses happened as the pandemic temporarily shut down treatment centers, clinics and other resources. Although numerous doctor\'s offices relied on telemedicine to resume daily functions, Lander said many people who struggle with substance use disorders dont have access to this.\r\nA lot of these folks dont have access to telemedicine infrastructure, he said. A large part of their recovery efforts has relied on face-to-face connection with a therapist or support group and that lack of face-to-face is a real challenge.\r\nIts not just patients who live in rural West Virginia. Dr. Jeanmarie Perrone, director of the center for addiction medicine and policy at the University of Pennsylvanias Perelman School of Medicine, said many of her patients in poor Philadelphia neighborhoods dont have access to broadband, either.\r\nShe said the sharp rise in overdoses could also be attributed to the mounting presence of fentanyl as dealers facing supply problems during the pandemic mix the substance into heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine.\r\nAlthough the study is concerning, it only captures a small fraction of the whole picture, Lander said. For every overdose that makes it to the emergency room, there are more overdoses that dont, either because the person was revived at home or died. And for every one of those overdoses, there are multiple people who are falling further into their substance use disorders behind closed doors.\r\nPeople who show up in the emergency department for an acute overdose are the tip of the iceberg, Lander said.\r\nThe study highlights the emergency department\'s important role in the health care system by not only stabilizing a patient but also treating them and referring them to other resources, experts say.\r\nIt also underscores the need for incorporating effective prevention strategies more broadly in COVID-19 response efforts, such as policies that can reduce economic burden or increase messaging around mental illness.\r\nOur health system here has been set up to wait for years for something bad to happen, Marshalek said.

"{'Understandably, COVID-19 has dominated conversations about health for the past year and a half. But the opioid epidemic hasnt gone away. People some of them our patients and many who never make it to a treatment program like ours continue to die from opioid addiction.\r\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported that drug overdose deaths reached an all-time high in 2020, with 93,000 Americans losing their lives. More than 60 percent of those deaths were from synthetic opioids like fentanyl, the powerful drug found all across the country. Another recent study suggests that these opioid deaths are vastly underreported. As we observe National Recovery Month, it is critical for society to recognize the crisis, understand how secrets and stigma allow it to grow, and marshal resources to continue to battle opioid addiction.\r\nWere only as sick as our secrets is an Alcoholics Anonymous proverb that refers to the roles that honesty and shame play in addiction. Those battling addiction and their families must talk about their experiences in order to expose the truth of their fights. The shame and secrecy around addiction has contributed to societys lack of understanding. Society does not appear to understand the magnitude of the issue, despite the fact that we call it a crisis. While outstanding efforts have been made in the areas of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, these efforts simply have not matched the breadth of the problem.\r\nThose who suffer from opioid addiction must often overcome three layers of stigma in order to accept evidence-based treatment. The first is the stigma of mental illness.Most people are more likely to accept a diagnosis of a physical disease, such as high blood pressure, stroke, or COVID infection, than a diagnosis of addiction, which is often seen as a character flaw or weakness rather than the chronic medical condition it is.\r\nNext, addiction brings a second layer of stigma on top of this greater than other mental illnesses such as depression or anxiety. This layer of stigma is reflected in the exhausted silence about the opioid epidemic: families are more likely to talk about a daughters depression than her addiction.\r\nFinally, the use of medications to treat opioid addiction faces resistance that forms a third layer of stigma. While medications like buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone have been proven to save lives, many people seeking treatment for opioid addiction dont want these medications, believing that the only recovery that counts is one that does not include any drug at all.\r\nOf course, the question that matters most of all is what we do next. Educational efforts are needed to make certain everyone knows what opioid addiction looks like, how to tell if a loved one may be developing a problem with opioids, and the elements of an evidence-based response to reduce the consequences of opioid use. These efforts must reach everyone: Data suggest that opioid overdose deaths among Black people are increasing faster than for other racial and ethnic groups. We have interventions, including mutual help groups like Narcotics Anonymous, and medications, for both treatment and overdose prevention, that work, and it is crucial that people understand these interventions and have access to them. We must also ensure access to treatment for especially vulnerable groups, including those without housing and those involved in the legal system.\r\nWe can start the process of saving lives with a simple step: talking about opioid addiction. We have kept too many secrets for far too long. Only honesty about our struggles will create the momentum necessary to mount a response that can halt the growing crisis. We have to share our stories of both losses of loved ones and treatment successes. Talking about those who have lost their battles with addiction may push others to get the help they need. Celebrating treatment successes gives people hope that this is a battle that can be won.\r\nThese are secrets we cannot afford to keep.\r\nDr. Ian Halim is a psychiatry resident and Dr. Kevin P.

"{'The study by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) poses questions about whether enough is being done statewide to minimize the deadly risks associated with the increasing number of people who smoke opioids, instead of injecting them with needles.\r\nThis study is a signal that more people are shifting their [drug-using] habits, and strategies need to shift, said Dr. Miriam Harriscq, an assistant professor of medicine at the Boston University School of Medicinecq and an addiction expert at Boston Medical Centercq. Inhalation spaces are absolutely critical.\r\nIn Massachusetts, injecting drugs is still the most common pathway to overdose deaths, but smoking-related overdoses are rising at a much faster rate. The percentage of overdose deaths with evidence of smoking more than quadrupled to 16.9 percent in 2022, up from 3.9 percent in 2020, according to CDC data. Those with evidence of injecting drugs rose from 12.1 percent to 19.7 percent over the same time,\xa0according to CDC data.\r\nA growing number of public health advocates and local officials have embraced the concept of supervised consumption sites, also known as safe injection sites, where people can inject illicit drugs under the watchful eye of trained professionals. Any designs for such sites will have to include so-called inhalation spaces or other accommodations for people who smoke drugs, and not just inhale them, say advocates for the sites.\r\nBecause of legal barriers, there are only two supervised drug consumption sites in the country, both in New York City, though another is scheduled to open early this year in Providence.\r\nCDC researchers found that the leading route of drug overdose deaths changed drastically over the past two years. The number of overdose fatalities with evidence of smoking soared 109 percent, with smoking the route for 23 percent of these deaths, beween January 2020 to December 2022. In contrast, the number of fatal overdoses with evidence that drugs had been injected has declined sharply, and accounted for 16 percent of overdose deaths over the same period. This shift was consistent across all regions of the country, the CDC found.\r\nThe sharp increase in the number of overdose deaths stemming from smoking could be driven, in part, by a rapidly growing practice known as polysubstance use, in which potent synthetic opioids are mixed with stimulants such as cocaine and counterfeit pain pills that are often smoked. Also, the shift could reflect a broader change in drug-using habits: People may be motivated to smoke drugs, rather than use needles, because smoking carries a lower risk of bloodborne and other infectious diseases, say addiction specialists.\r\nYet inhaling illicit substances can intensify the effects of the drugs and increase the overdose risk, the CDC said in its study. Nearly 80 percent of overdose deaths with evidence of smoking had no evidence of injection. And persons who use drugs by smoking might not take advantage of traditional syringe service programs where harm-reduction supplies are available, according to the CDC report.\r\nAlthough unsafe injection drug use practices might be most risky in terms of infectious disease transmission, other routes, particularly smoking, still carry substantial overdose risk, the CDC study said.\r\nIn 2022, overdose fatalities in Massachusetts reached 2,359 the highest on record and more than triple the number from a decade ago. The rise in overdose deaths has been propelled by the proliferation of the cheap and highly potent opioid fentanyl, which is deadly even in tiny amounts, and the mixing of opioids with stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine.\r\nAllyson Pinkhover director of substance use services at Brockton Neighborhood Health Center, said the findings reinforce the importance of including so-called safer smoking supplies in harm-reduction outreach efforts. Supplies such as clean pipes, rubberized mouthpieces, and alcohol swabs, can reduce the transmission of diseases, including hepatitis c.\r\nThere is still a lack of understanding of the risks associated with smoking illicit drugs, Pinkhover said. There is strong evidence that providing safer smoking supplies helps [users] stay engaged in care, and prevents some of the negative health impacts associated with smoking.\r\nChris Serres can be reached at chris.serres@globe.com.

"{'Overdose-reversal drug Narcan is now allowed without a prescription, but experts are warning it doesn\'t work on a common street drug circulating in big cities today called xylazine.\r\nNearly 25% of fentanyl powder seized in the United States last year was mixed with xylazine, a horse and cattle tranquilizer, according to Drug Enforcement Administration.\r\nKnown as the street drug ""tranq,"" ""tranq dope"" or ""zombie heroin,"" xylazine is dangerous because it depresses breathing, lengthens overdoses, and causes skin ulcers and sores that last for months.\r\nCommunity groups praised the Food and Drug Administration\'s move to allow retail sales of Narcan, saying it will help save many lives.\r\nHarm-reduction experts said it\'s important to carry naloxone because the vast majority of overdoses involve opioids such as illicit fentanyl or heroin. More than 107,000 people died from overdoses during the 12 months through August 2023, and two-thirds of those deaths involved synthetic opioids.\r\nStill, doctors warn naloxone doesn\'t work on xylazine, which is increasingly found in illicit fentanyl and heroin.\r\n""Everyone should carry naloxone. Everyone should carry Narcan,"" said Kevin Sabet, president and CEO of the Foundation for Drug Policy Solutions. ""But society shouldn\'t carry the idea that this is going to be the way out of this drug epidemic.""\r\nLATEST: Why Congress is cracking down on animal tranquilizer \r\nWHAT TO KNOW: Xylazine is latest threat in opioid epidemic\r\nWhere is xylazine found?\r\nXylazine-laced fentanyl surfaced in Philadelphia and Puerto Rico last decade.\r\nOverdose deaths involving xylazine increased from 2% to 26% in Pennsylvania from 2015 to 2020, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. In 2021, about 1 in 5 Maryland overdose deaths and 1 in 10 Connecticut overdose deaths involved xylazine. The fatal doses contained fentanyl in more than 98% of cases.\r\nBut the drug is no longer confined to the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions. In a recent public health alert, the DEA said tranq has surfaced in 48 states.\r\nThe House and Senate last week introduced a bill that would make xylazine a controlled substance. The bipartisan legislation aims to help the DEA and local law enforcement ""get xylazine off our streets,"" according to Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev.\r\nSrikrishna V. Malayala, an addiction medicine physician at the Merakey methadone clinic in Philadelphia, said patients routinely tell him that they don\'t seek tranq when buying drugs.\r\nThey want fentanyl they don\'t want tranq, Malayala said. They know they have no choice but buying whatever is on the streets.\r\nEffects of xylazine and why it causes wounds\r\nXylazine works by constricting blood vessels, which slows the flow of blood to organs. People who take the drug often develop skin ulcers and sores that can become infected. Some can develop necrosis, or rotting skin, that in extreme cases can lead to amputation.\r\nIt blocks the blood vessels and the blood supply, Malayala said of the drug. And as soon as they have a little wound, it gets infected very quickly likely due to a lack of typical blood flow.\r\nPeople develop wounds on their legs, hands and belly. Malayala knows of one patient who had both legs amputated after her skin, muscles and bones became severely infected.\r\nFor people with opioid-use disorder, it can be especially challenging to get proper medical care. Some might be reluctant to seek care due to stigma. For others, life circumstances can make it difficult to adhere to recommendations such as routinely changing gauze to allow wounds to heal.\r\nIn one case that Malayala studied, a 37-year-old woman injected eight to 10 bags of fentanyl per day and developed rotting wounds on her lower legs. She repeatedly sought care at a Philadelphia hospital but would leave despite doctors\' advice. Eventually, she stayed three weeks to complete treatment and was discharged with instructions to apply medicine, clean and cover the wounds.\r\nComplicating matters is treatment options are limited. And homeless shelters or nursing homes that aren\'t equipped to take care of these patients won\'t take them.\r\n""So the wounds persist and (increases) chances of getting infected, getting septic and dying,"" Malayala said.\r\nWhy Narcan doesnt work on tranq\r\nNarcan is an approved branded nasal spray and the best known form of naloxone. Naloxone binds to opioid receptors and can block and reverse the effects of opioids such as heroin or fentanyl.\r\nNaloxone is widely distributed by community organizations that seek to slow the nation\'s spiraling overdose epidemic, and community health departments, schools, police and fire departments often carry the drug.\r\nPeople were accustomed to using Narcan and recovering relatively quickly from an overdose. But with tranq, efforts are slowed, said Al Ostapeck, a harm reduction project manager with Alliance Lower East Side, which operates a needle exchange program and distributes naloxone.\r\nIt makes the overdose more complex, he said. Tranq has infiltrated the heroin and fentanyl supply in the nation\'s largest city and complicates the safety of users, he said.\r\nWhen tranq is added to the mix, a person who overdoses and is administered naloxone might not respond for hours. Some need oxygen or other on-site support, Ostapeck said. In some cases, they might need advanced care offered in a hospital emergency room.\r\nSome also administer repeated doses of Narcan to an overdose victim who shows no signs of responding. Not only are people slower to respond, they can experience symptoms of withdrawal if they get multiple doses of the overdose reversal drug.\r\nLet\'s say they\'re four doses in and now that person is in very heavy withdrawal, Ostapeck said. But they\'re also on xylazine. They\'re totally unconscious, unable to move or communicate.\r\nEnding the nation\'s drug epidemic\r\nSabet, of the Foundation for Drug Policy Solutions, said the fact that the nation\'s overdose deaths have climbed even as naloxone is more widely available is one reason to consider a more comprehensive approach to the nation\'s drug epidemic.\r\n""Some people think we should just have test strips and Narcan,"" Sabet said. ""It\'s a fool\'s errand because there are countless other drugs as lethal as fentanyl or as as dangerous as xylazine that are going to be inflicting the drug supply in the years to come.""\r\nHe said the key will be to reduce the nation\'s demand from drugs and that starts with halting use among teens and young adults. It also means making sure those who are addicted have adequate treatment options.\r\n""We need to double down on universal prevention,"" Sabet said.\r\nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration offers a confidential and free treatment referral help line.

"{'GUADALUPE, Ariz. Valerie Molina anxiously searched the desert sky, scanning the horizon for any clouds dark with rain. But all was blue and bright. Today, the weather wasnt going to be on her side.\r\nIt was March 20, 2020, and Guadalupe, over which Molina presides as mayor, was preparing for what should have been the third of six Friday ceremonies in the run-up to Easter. Normally, its the time of year when the town of 6,700 doubles in size, as spectators from across the state descend on its white adobe church to witness young men in wooden masks, a sacred deer antler headdress, and ankle rattles made from the cocoons of butterflies dance to beating drums beneath ribbons of flowers. Guadalupe was founded by Pascua Yaqui Indians who were forced from their homelands in Sonora, Mexico, and settled in the Salt River Valley in the early 1900s, bringing with them their unique religion a blend of spiritual animism and Catholic beliefs picked up from Jesuit missionaries.\r\nA dusty, single square mile of low-slung, sun-baked homes wedged between Phoenix and Tempe, Guadalupe is culturally and economically a world apart from the golf course-studded subdivisions just beyond its borders. A third of its residents, most of whom identify as Yaqui, Hispanic, or a combination of the two, live below the poverty line, often with multiple generations sharing the same home. Its the kind of place where you cant walk too far without running into a relative. (Molinas vice mayor, Ricardo Vital, is also her first cousin.) Though insular, the close-knit community isnt isolated.\r\nadvertisement\r\nMost of Guadalupes working population traveled each day to essential service jobs at schools, restaurants, and landscaping businesses in surrounding areas. Molina wasnt sure how her resource-strapped town without a health department and with an annual budget of just $12 million would be able to defend itself if the coronavirus gained a foothold there.\r\nOnly days before, the World Health Organization had declared Covid-19 a global pandemic, and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey had banned any events with more than 50 people. Crucially, his order exempted religious gatherings. That was the one thing, said Molina. And that was going to kill us.\r\nadvertisement\r\nMuch to her relief, spring rainstorms had cancelled the first Fridays festivities. And the second Friday too. That had bought her some time to meet with the towns cultural society leaders and come up with a plan for how they might keep the sacred ceremonies from becoming coronavirus superspreading events.\r\nThe leaders had agreed to take some precautions on that Friday the 20th and at all the remaining Lenten festivities like barricading off the church to onlookers and canceling food vendors and other carnival activities. But the measures and the virus didnt prove to be the deterrent Molina had hoped they would be. People continued to pack into the church plaza week after week.\r\nLooking across the crowd that gathered on Easter Sunday, she felt sick to her stomach. All I could think about, she recalled, was, Whats it going to look like in 14 days?\r\nResearch technician Tyler Perleberg (front) removes wastewater samples from a cooler, assisted by (from left) lab technician Allan Yanez and research interns Erin Clancy and Allison Binsfeld, at the Center for Environmental Health Engineering at Arizona State University.Caitlin OHara for STAT \r\nFourteen days later, one of Rolf Haldens students wheeled a scratched-up cooler into his lab on the second floor of the Biodesign Institute a copper-paneled complex of buildings on the Arizona State University campus. With in-person classes canceled and most research on hold, the cavernous bay of work benches was eerily empty except for Haldens small team extracting the contents of the cooler: plastic jugs of murky gray liquid that only hours before had been drawn from Tempes sewers.\r\nIn some ways, this was an old routine for the scientists. Halden is director of the Center for Environmental Health Engineering at the Biodesign Institute. His lab had been analyzing the citys wastewater for nearly two years. In 2018, they started fishing out molecular fingerprints of different kinds of opioids consumed across the city. The next year, they got a National Institutes of Health grant to use that monitoring network to track influenza. But when SARS-CoV-2 emerged that winter, they quickly pivoted to testing for the new coronavirus instead.\r\nIt took his team a few months to hone their methods but by April they were bringing more of the citys seven sewersheds online each week. They filtered and spun down the samples, then loaded them into a desktop polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, machine. Inside, short strings of synthetic DNA swirled, grabbing onto any matching bits of SARS-CoV-2 they encountered, and giving off a fluorescent glow when they did. As the machine recorded any glimmers, it beamed the readout to a nearby computer. More light meant more virus, represented on the computer screen as a series of curves, one for each sewershed where samples had been collected: hundreds of thousands of toilet flushes captured in a spray of spidery arcs.\r\nTwo of them caught Haldens eye. Today was the first time they were analyzing samples from Area 3. Located in the southwest corner of Tempe, Area 3 is shaped a bit like a giant amoeba eating a milk jug. That jug is the town of Guadalupe, and all of its sewage flowed into Area 3. Tempe utility workers were also sampling at the points where the pipes changed municipalities, so they could isolate the contribution of Guadalupes sewage from Area 3s.\r\nWhen Halden looked at the curve for Area 3, it showed a gradual incline, barely enough virus to be detectable. In contrast, the curve for Guadalupe shot straight up into the millions of copies per liter. Those numbers meant Covid-19 was already spreading through the community. If theyd only looked at Area 3, they would have missed it completely. Area 3 is much bigger, so this significant signal from this small community was very quickly being drowned out, said Halden.\r\nHe alerted Rosa Inchausti, Tempes then-director of strategic management and diversity, who was coordinating the wastewater testing pilots. In early May, she called Molina with a warning and an offer to share the data Haldens team had collected.\r\nJust by chance, it was the little nugget we were looking for, said Molina.\r\nWith Covid testing then limited, she was blinded to the virus spreading through her community and she had struggled to get health officials in the region to pay attention to her pleas for information. But armed with the wastewater data Tempe was offering, Molina was finally able to marshal the resources her town needed to fend off the virus.\r\nFor Halden, who for decades had been a lonely evangelist for the emerging field of wastewater-based epidemiology, the story of Guadalupe illustrates the potential he believes it has to transform public health in the United States by creating a near-real-time monitoring network that could identify not just Covid-19 and drug use within a community, but also other pathogens and even chronic conditions like cancer, Alzheimers, and mental health disorders. Weve seen from our data how important it is to have a fine enough resolution that you can catch clusters of infections in specific areas, like Guadalupe, said Halden. We could only have observed that by having this neighborhood-by-neighborhood network.\r\nIn the last year, the nations enthusiasm has finally caught up to his own. As the pandemic spread, hundreds of U.S. cities, states, prisons, universities, and private businesses leaped, sometimes clumsily, into wastewater surveillance. Federal investments in validating the science and building out a standardized national system followed. With vaccines driving SARS-CoV-2 underground, the question now is, what will governments, schools, and businesses do with all that surveillance infrastructure?\r\nTempe, operating at an unprecedented level of granularity, represents the leading edge of whats possible. But while the technology becomes more powerful for answering scientific questions and crafting public health interventions the more finely you slice and dice the sewershed, it also raises more privacy concerns. The American wastewater surveillance revolution might have started with SARS-CoV-2, but theres no telling yet where it ultimately will lead.\r\nRolf Halden, director of the Center for Environmental Health Engineering at Arizona States Biodesign Institute.Caitlin OHara for STAT\r\nHalden, now in his mid-50s, wasnt always fascinated by feces. He grew up near Braunschweig, Germany, about 15 miles from the floodlit, mine-laden complex of interlocking fences and walls known as the death strip that divided his home country into West and East. In the 1960s, as the Cold War turned the severed state against itself, the Iron Curtain wasnt exactly a safe place for a child to go wandering.\r\nBut for Halden, it was less scary than staying home. His father was bipolar, and his mercurial moods often convulsed into violence. Being outside brought Halden relief. Hed let his legs carry him through fog-covered fields, seeking out the few streams and stands of trees that had managed to resist post-war agricultural land reforms. He found friends in tadpoles and newborn fawns. He discovered that this, observing life, had a name: biology.\r\nIn college, he took up the study formally. But when he graduated a few years later, he discovered there wasnt much demand for biologists. He opted to stay in school and pursue another degree in something more practical: sanitary engineering. Then his adviser got an offer to become a professor in America and he asked Halden to join him. It would mean switching focus yet again. And moving to a city hed never heard of Minneapolis. But the important thing was that it was far from Braunschweig.\r\nAfter knocking out an environmental engineering masters and a Ph.D. at the University of Minnesota, Halden was eager to leave the cold and snow, but not ready yet to return home. So when Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory beckoned in 1997 with a postdoctorate offer that included a green card and mild Bay Area climate, he jumped at the opportunity. He stayed on another four years as a staff engineer, working in the rain-starved hills above the Altamont Speedway, where in December of 1969, four Rolling Stones concert-goers had died, bringing with them the end of the era of free love and radical idealism.\r\nBack then, the U.S. Department of Energy used its nearby research facility, dubbed Site 300, to test new explosives and nuclear weapons. As a result, by the time Halden arrived a few decades later, Site 300 was one of the most polluted places in the U.S. It was his job to help figure out how to clean it up. His team discovered that some of the microbes that lived there were as efficient as any machines they had to extract the contaminants.\r\nIn 2001, he left Livermore to join the Center for Water and Health at Johns Hopkins University. While there, he got interested in another kind of toxic sludge, the kind that is left over after the contents of a citys worth of toilet bowl flushes has gone through an industrial treatment plant. This semi-solid material is composed of bacteria and protozoa and everything the microbes cant break down, including organic solids, minerals like phosphorus and nitrogen, and heavy metals. Whatever ends up in the sludge is the stuff that biology doesnt know what to do with, said Halden. It becomes an inventory of the toxic chemicals people are exposed to.\r\nThe carbon in sludge acts like a sponge, soaking up and concentrating all the water-fearing chemicals. They might be rare in the environment a few nanograms floating in the air or buried in the soil. But in sludge they build up many hundreds of thousands of times. And since many cities and counties convert their sludge into dry fertilizer and sell it to farmers and urban gardeners, essentially recycling and redistributing any pollutants inside it, Halden thought someone should be looking at sludge more carefully.\r\nBut the towering German, despite his infectious enthusiasm, couldnt exactly drive around to Baltimores wastewater plants with canteen in-hand asking for handouts. If you show up with a truck you could get a load for free and nobody would ask any questions, he said. But if you come with a jar and you look like a scientist, well, then you have a hard time, because they dont want you to find something that will potentially create problems for them.\r\nFrustrated, he called up the Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates wastewater. In 2001, the agency had collected about 100 samples of sludge from across the country as part of a nationwide survey. As it happened, theyd been sitting in a freezer for five years and were about to be thrown out. All Halden had to do was drive to a nearby contractors lab and pick them up. A few years later, when the agency did another national survey, Halden, who had relocated to Arizona State, raised his hand again. He was also spending hours on the phone with wastewater treatment plant operators, begging for access to samples.\r\nSludge repository amassed, Haldens team dove in, pulling the samples apart molecule by molecule using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. Among the molecules they discovered were significant amounts of triclocarban and triclosan, two microbe-slaying chemicals widely used in soaps, detergents, and hand sanitizers. When broken down in the human body, they derail hormone signaling, and they have been linked to allergies in children and low sperm counts in men.\r\nOther researchers had found the same chemicals in the bodies of earthworms and bottlenose dolphins, in the eggs of seabirds and in human breast milk. But Haldens research was the first to find them in sewage sludge. He began to sound the alarm, even testifying before Congress on the environmental health risks of the increasingly ubiquitous pollutants. In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration banned triclocarban and triclosan, along with 17 other antimicrobials from hand soaps and body washes, in part based on data from Haldens wastewater surveillance.\r\nAround that time, Halden had recently returned from a sabbatical to Europe, where a different form of wastewater monitoring, one that worked upstream of treatment plants, had begun to take off. Over there, countries incinerated their sludge, they didnt spread it on food-growing fields. So there wasnt much reason to study it. But starting in 2000, researchers in Milan showed that they could use samples taken from the Po River and from inside sewers in different Italian cities to measure the amounts of different prescription medications the local populace was excreting. A few years later, they did the same thing with cocaine. In 2010, researchers established a Europe-wide network of sewage samplers to probe for illicit drug use across the continent. By the time Halden arrived to tour the project, it had grown to an annual survey of 56 cities in 19 countries.\r\nThe concept was to analyze in as many places as possible and you do it right and you do it every year and you look at trends, he said. Such data serves its purpose well illuminating for European regulators the true size of the drug market but it has its limitations. Halden, who had been bitten by the public health bug during his stint at Johns Hopkins, saw the potential to generate data that could have a more direct impact. I thought, why dont we do this much more frequently and share the data with the community in real time so it actually becomes informative for taking public health actions?\r\nTo test the idea, he applied for a number of grants, but only got a pile of rejections. Then, in 2018, he learned that the Tempe City Council was looking for projects to help reduce opioid-related overdoses and deaths.\r\nWe were trying to find where the opioids were within certain areas of our city, said Tempe City Councilmember Joel Navarro, a firefighter who is also chair of the Regional Opioid Action Plan Committee. Halden told them he could provide a neighborhood-by-neighborhood look into the Tempe populations drug use by panning for chemical remnants left behind in the citys sewage. After all, everybody poops.\r\nAfter considerable public conversation, the council voted to try it out. Tempe invested $35,000 to build out the sampling network, and ASU kicked in matching funds for Haldens lab to run the analysis. One of the first issues was figuring out where to do the sampling. In Tempe, as in most cities, that system relies on gravity. When a resident there flushes a toilet, the contents go out into a sewer line angled so that everything inside it flows downhill until it reaches a bigger pipe that feeds into a regional treatment facility. At the last downstream point before those bigger pipes dump into the plant, the city has established monitoring sites to measure the rate and volume of flow. The plant then uses those measurements to charge the city for processing the wastewater. From an efficiency point of view, it made sense to just repurpose those. So the city installed composite samplers at each one essentially an automated pump programmed to draw a small amount of wastewater out of the sewer at regular intervals over a 24-hour period.\r\nStarting that summer, municipal utility crews would stop by each station weekly to gather the goods. Then one of Haldens students would pick the samples up and bring them back to the lab, where theyd be filtered and run through the spectrometer, which would tell them exactly which opioids were in each one, and how much. They reported these levels back to the city, which posted them to a public dashboard.\r\nThe information helped Tempes Fire and Medical Rescue Department respond when synthetic opioids like fentanyl and carfentanyl began flooding into certain corners of the city at the end of 2018. We saw this drug show up as an extremely high spike before we started getting the calls, said Nick Ells, medical services deputy chief for Tempe. That spurred them to stock up their trucks and ambulances with more of the overdose medication Narcan. With heroin, it usually takes 1 or 2 milligrams of Narcan to bring somebody into a state where theyre breathing. For fentanyl and carfentanyl, his team has found it often takes 5 milligrams or more. These synthetic narcotics are just so much more potent than anything else youll find on the streets, said Ellis.\r\nAround that time, Halden nabbed a $1.5 million NIH grant to turn the network theyd established for monitoring drugs into an early warning system for flu outbreaks. His lab was gearing up to start that work in December 2019. And then SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan, China. By January, it was clear the coronavirus would be coming here too, said Halden. So we started to explore the possibility of pivoting to measure an RNA virus instead.\r\nI thought, why dont we do this much more frequently and share the data with the community in real time so it actually becomes informative for taking public health actions?\r\nRolf Halden, Arizona State University\r\nInside the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, molecular epidemiologists like Amy Kirby were batting around the same idea. She had studied using wastewater to track the movement of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the environment. And she knew that countries like Israel had used the technology for decades to monitor for the virus that causes polio. There was also increasing evidence that people infected with SARS-CoV-2 were shedding viral RNA into their feces. The problem was that prior to 2020, there was no infrastructure for wastewater surveillance in the U.S., she said.\r\nHow much information you can extract from sewage depends on what youre looking for. Because SARS-CoV-2 was so new, scientists hadnt yet figured out how to translate viral RNA concentrations into numbers of infected people. (In fact, thats still an open question.) And lots of local variables temperature, how far wastewater travels, how long it sits in the sewer can all impact the outcome. Without preexisting infrastructure, no one had set standards or best practices for how to collect and analyze samples.\r\nWe didnt want to just muddy the water with more data thats not interpretable, so the first question we tried to answer was can we understand whether this data is useful for public health? Kirby said. To do so, the agency leaned on a few early adopters, like Halden and the city of Tempe, who were willing to volunteer their data. It showed that the most meaningful information came from looking at changing viral concentrations over time. We saw repeatedly across multiple communities that wastewater trends were leading case trends, said Kirby. So when cases went up, the first signal wed get would come from the wastewater, about four to six days before confirmed cases.\r\nLast August, the CDC announced the creation of a National Wastewater Surveillance System, or NWWS (pronounced news), with Kirby at its head. One of its aims is to create a data portal to collate local findings. Shed always wanted to build something like that, but the return on investment for monitoring antibiotic resistance hadnt been high enough. Covid completely changed the calculus on that, she said. What would normally have taken four to five years to establish, her team was trying to do in four to five months. Now, not only is it worth establishing, but its worth establishing as fast as you can with whatever data you can pull together.\r\nAs Kirby was leading the charge to develop standards and recommendations, wastewater surveillance was exploding, driven by local government officials and business leaders scrambling against the spread of the virus and desperate for any scrap of data that could help them make better decisions. Hundreds of towns and cities participated in a free testing program offered by Biobot Analytics, a startup that spun out from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2017. Dozens of colleges and universities launched their own pilot projects.\r\nIn the fall, the Department of Health and Human Services signed a $1.5 million contract with Aquavitas, a Scottsdale, Ariz.-based startup run by one of Haldens former graduate students, to study how well its wastewater epidemiology technology tracked SARS-CoV-2 across 100 treatment plants serving 10% of the U.S. population. That project is now moving into phase two sampling wastewater from 340 plants across 42 states, albeit with Biobot now running the testing.\r\nAdam Gushgari, Aquavitas CEO, has been somewhat shocked at the sudden interest. He recalled attending a conference back in 2018, where Halden, his adviser at the time, gave the keynote address. Afterward, they gathered for beers with all the other wastewater epidemiology researchers in the U.S. There werent more than 15 of them. Now, if you got everybody in the U.S. who is doing this, we would fill a stadium! he said. All of a sudden we went from being a fringe science that nobody really cared about to being in the forefront of the public eye.\r\nFor some legal scholars and privacy advocates, that sudden shift signals trouble down the road. Covid-19 provided the trigger for lots of colleges and municipalities to invest in this surveillance infrastructure, said Natalie Ram, a law professor at the University of Maryland who studies bioethics and genetic privacy. Theyre not just going to disassemble it when Covid-19 is no longer a public health emergency. Which raises the question, what else is this infrastructure going to be used for?\r\nCompanies like Aquavitas can provide at least a glimpse into the possibilities. Gushgari told STAT that while Covid-19 is still his biggest business driver, hes starting to see the emergence of other markets. He said hes in talks with one city about monitoring for molecules that people with Alzheimers disease shed into their blood and urine. Another one is interested in cancer. One client, a private high school with a strict vegetarian diet policy, contracted Aquavitas to look for signs their students were sneaking animal products on the sly. He says theres no ceiling on what the technology can be turned to. If you take it or youre exposed to it and it comes out of your urine or feces, we can track it, he said.\r\nTheyre not just going to disassemble it when Covid-19 is no longer a public health emergency. What else is this infrastructure going to be used for?\r\nNatalie Ram, University of Maryland law professor\r\nTempe, for its part, is starting to explore other applications of its surveillance apparatus. On June 10, the city adopted a budget that includes an additional $950,000 to begin monitoring for at least a dozen new substances, including molecular traces of other viruses such as measles, parasites, alcohol, asthma medications, and stress hormones, and biomarkers of exposure to toxic fumes like benzene. The results will be publicly reported on an online dashboard. I think there is potential to start really morphing into a whole gamut of areas to make the city healthier, said Councilmember Navarro. The funds will also expand the citys wastewater sampling infrastructure to 11 sewersheds over the next two years.\r\nWhen such monitoring is happening on the scale of an entire neighborhood or university campus, Ram said theres not much to worry about in terms of ones privacy. Wastewater, by its very nature, is an admixture of material from lots of different households. And theres no way to connect which toilets different chemicals came out of. But the more granular things get say a city sampling every block then theres more cause for concern.\r\nTheres also the scenario where its not governments, but private entities, like schools or employers, using wastewater as a way to find out something about the health of its workforce that it otherwise wouldnt be privy to. As new as the science of wastewater epidemiology is, the legal and ethical frameworks around it are even less established.\r\nThats what gives me pause, said Ram. Like all surveillance tools, it always starts with the least objectionable use the most heinous crimes, the most palatable public health crisis. But it almost never stays with that narrow use. So thats not to say we shouldnt embrace the technology during a hopefully once-in-a-century public health emergency, but we also need to think about the ethical, legal, and social implications of doing so.\r\nWastewater sample concentrates from May 2020 are kept frozen in the Center for Environmental Health Engineering.Caitlin OHara for STAT\r\nIf you ask Molina, shed say that embracing the technology made all the difference for Guadalupe. Shortly after last years Easter celebrations, an official from the Maricopa County Public Health Department let her know that someone living in the ZIP code that encompasses Guadalupe and neighboring areas of Tempe had tested positive for Covid. She asked for more details. Guadalupe accounted for only a fraction of the nearly 46,000 people living in that ZIP code. Was it actually in her town? But, she said, Maricopa County officials offered no further information, not until she sent them the wastewater data Haldens lab had generated.\r\nOnce they had segregated out Covid-19 test results by address, it was obvious exactly how much of a problem Molina had on her hands. Guadalupes residents were contracting the coronavirus at rates nearly six times higher than the rest of the county. Given the lack of testing at the time though, the real number of infections was likely far higher.\r\nThat data also helped Molina get the ear of Peter Yucupicio, the new chairman of the Pascua Yaqui Tribal Council. As a kid, hed spent summers with his grandfather in Guadalupe. And hed seen what was happening in the Navajo Nation, where Covid-19 was infecting more people per capita than anywhere else in the U.S. As the death toll climbed, the loss of tribal elders the keepers of language and stewards of sacred knowledge was especially traumatic. He couldnt let that happen to Guadalupe. Yucupicio gathered the council and together they decided to send $2 million to the town.\r\nIt was a generous gift, and Molina wanted to use it well. She thought back to when she was a kid, and what would happen if you started missing school. Two women, friends of her grandmother, would come around to find out what was going on. And then theyd help. Sometimes that meant doing laundry so the children had clean clothes to wear. Sometimes it meant teaching parents how to rid their kids hair of lice. They were like social workers, but they didnt work for the state. These so-called promotoras were women with deep ties whom everyone trusted, especially when they gave advice about health.\r\nI thought, thats what we need for Covid-19, said Molina. We need a promotora to go to peoples homes and educate them about masks and testing and how to quarantine.\r\nSo she called up Veronica Perez, a recently retired tribal social worker who knew just about everyone in Guadalupe and offered her the job. Perez agreed, and she recruited Graciela Holguin, a hospice worker, to help her. Together, they began criss-crossing the town, working off a list of names and addresses provided by the countys contact-tracing team, delivering boxes packed with food, laundry detergent, masks, thermometers, hand sanitizer, and disinfectants to households where someone had tested positive. If people wanted to talk, theyd do so from the driveway.\r\nEarly on, Perez made the mistake of wearing black sneakers they got so hot from the summer sun that they burned weeping blisters onto her toes. Some days they started before 6 a.m., and they often finished after midnight. Everyone was in the dark, said Perez. We were just trying to help them with whatever they needed.\r\nBut they were behind the curve, and as Covid-19 engulfed the state in a post-Memorial Day surge, more and more of the promotoras time was spent at wakes. In La Cuarenta, the oldest part of town named for the original 40 acres on which Guadalupe was founded, the church towers peeled a mournful toll every time a Covid-19 victim passed away. Residents of that neighborhood began calling it the summer of the bells.\r\nIt was one or two every week, said Molina. Thats when it really hit our community how serious this was.\r\nAround that time, the Maricopa County health department and Arizona State joined the Pascua Yaqui Tribe as partners, and in mid-June, the town launched an official Covid-19 response team. They converted an open-air market to a free testing site. The county bought up rooms in a hotel just up the road from Guadalupe and converted it to a free isolation center, providing private rooms for people with Covid-19 to recover away from vulnerable family members.\r\nThe partnership and the promotora program started to pay off. By the end of August, the amount of virus in the wastewater had dropped below detectable levels. Confirmed cases petered out too.\r\nThroughout the fall and winter months, Guadalupe experienced a few upticks, but nothing like the devastating post-holiday surges that stole hundreds of thousands of American lives across much of the country. When the FDA authorized vaccines, the promotoras switched up their routine, educating the towns residents about how the vaccines worked and answering their questions. By the time this years Lenten festivities rolled around, more than 40% of Guadalupe residents had received at least one shot. Most days the town didnt record a single new Covid case.\r\nOn Easter Sunday this year, the plaza filled with flowers and music and the smells of foods being cooked over open flames. People packed the church to pray. And this time, Molina wasnt hovering, worrying. She was at home, where her fully vaccinated family gathered, all together for the first time in more than a year. There were hugs, and tears, and not a Zoom room to be seen. It felt like a different world, Molina said.\r\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly described the funding of Haldens wastewater sampling work for Tempe.': ""{'PERSON': ['Valerie Molina', 'Rolf Haldens', 'Tyler Perleberg', 'Allan Yanez', 'Erin Clancy', 'Allison Binsfeld', 'Rosa Inchausti', 'Ricardo Vital', 'Doug Ducey', 'Rolf Halden', 'Adam Gushgari', 'Natalie Ram', 'Joel Navarro', 'Nick Ells', 'Amy Kirby', 'Peter Yucupicio', 'Veronica Perez', 'Graciela Holguin'], 'DATE': ['March 20, 2020', 'December 2019', '2018', 'In 2018', 'In 2010', 'Last August', 'June 10', 'mid-June', 'By the end of August', 'Throughout the fall and winter months', 'Easter Sunday this year'], 'LOC': ['GUADALUPE', 'Ariz', 'Madrid', 'Phoenix', 'Tempe', 'Sonora, Mexico', 'Salt River Valley', 'United States', 'Baltimore', 'Area 3', 'Tempe', 'Braunschweig, Germany', 'West', 'East', 'Minneapolis', 'Minnesota', 'Bay Area', 'Altamont Speedway', 'U.S.', 'Site 300', 'Maricopa County', 'Guadalupe', 'Tempe utility workers', 'Europe', 'Milan', 'Italy', 'Scottsdale, Ariz.', 'Arizona', 'Johns Hopkins University'], 'ORG': ['World Health Organization', 'Doctors Without Borders', 'Center for Environmental Health Engineering', 'National Wastewater Surveillance System', 'Arizona State University', 'Biodesign Institute', 'Food and Drug Administration', 'Biobot Analytics', 'MIT', 'Aquavitas', 'National Institutes of Health', 'Pascua Yaqui Tribal Council'], 'PROGRAMS': ['wastewater analysis', 'resource hub', 'cultural society leaders', 'wastewater surveillance', 'wastewater sampling', 'promotora program'], 'IMPACT': ['COVID-19 spreading', 'Toxic sludge', 'Early warning system', 'Monitor drug use', 'COVID-19 Response', 'Vaccination Campaign']}""}"
