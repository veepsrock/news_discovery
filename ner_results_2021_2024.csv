"{'Both cigarettes and opioids are highly addictive—and potentially deadly. Both substances are sold by profiteering companies using science distorted by spin or outright lies. And both have been the subjects of multi-billion-dollar lawsuits.\r\nBut opioids are not cigarettes. And as the opioid settlements finally near completion, it is crucial not to misapply lessons learned from tobacco. Fundamentally, this means accepting that—unlike cigarettes—opioids have genuine uses in both pain and addiction medicine.\r\nSo far, however, we are doing the opposite. Rather than recognizing that some people with intractable pain benefit from opioids, we continue to reduce access— typically without offering affordable and effective alternatives.\r\nRather than acknowledging that closing “pill mills” and identifying “doctor shoppers” more often drives people to dangerous street drugs than to recovery, we frequently abandon patients in withdrawal. And instead of admitting that the best treatment for opioid addiction—the only one proved to cut the death rate by 50 percent or more—is medical opioids (typically buprenorphine or methadone, but some countries use heroin), we primarily offer abstinence-based treatment.\r\nUnderstanding where the analogy between opioids and cigarettes holds—and where it goes astray—can guide better policy.\r\nFirst, unlike for cigarettes, interrupting the opioid supply can kill rather than cure. One recent study of more than 100,000 patients published in JAMA examined dose reductions among people who had taken opioids for at least a year. Researchers expected these cuts to lower overdose risk.\r\nInstead, regardless of how quickly or slowly drugs were tapered, opioid reduction nearly doubled the odds that patients would overdose. And compared with those whose dosages were stable, these patients had more than twice the risk of hospitalization for psychiatric problems, including suicide attempts.\r\nEarlier research bolsters these findings. One study found that patients who had their doses lowered rapidly were nearly four times more likely to die by suicide. Another study, conducted with veterans, showed that abrupt cessation hiked suicide risk by a factor of seven for those who had received opioids long term.\r\nBecause five million to eight million Americans currently take opioids for chronic pain, these data suggest that many of today’s overdose and suicide cases may actually result from our attempts to ameliorate the crisis.\r\nBy contrast, quitting smoking enhances life expectancy (though it can sometimes increase depression in vulnerable populations). And even so, our strategies for fighting Big Tobacco have not involved making cigarettes legally inaccessible to current smokers. Indeed, banning cigarettes outright—or making them available only by increasingly difficult to obtain prescriptions—was not even on the table during settlement talks because regulators appreciated that this would create a large, dangerous black market.\r\nThe same caution was not applied to opioids. Since 2011 prescribing has fallen by at least 60 percent, largely thanks to ramped up prescription-monitoring databases and prosecution of “pill mill” physicians. The crackdown scared even legitimate doctors into dropping chronic pain patients—as well as anyone else who might possibly be addicted.\r\nNot surprisingly, this created a bonanza for dealers—whose products, unlike legal drugs, are unregulated and vary widely in dosage and purity. Consequently, as prescribing dropped, overdose deaths more than doubled, reaching a record high of more than 93,000 in 2020.\r\nYet antiopioid crusaders have dug in their heels, continuing to take the wrong lessons from tobacco’s history. Big Pharma lied about opioid benefits, just as Big Tobacco lied about cigarettes. Therefore, they argued, any positive claims about opioids must be squelched and the medical supply must fall even further.\r\nThis approach obscures facts about addiction that are critical to prevention and treatment. For one, most opioid addiction does not start with medical care. Eighty percent of people who begin misusing prescription opioids get them from friends, family or other illegal sources, not physicians—and nearly all those who become addicted have already used other drugs such as cocaine or methamphetamine.\r\nMoreover, addictions typically start in youth, with 90 percent beginning as experimentation in adolescence or early adulthood. Chronic pain, in contrast, tends to arise in middle or late life.\r\nAs a result, fewer than 8 percent of people who take opioids long term for pain develop new addictions, according to a review co-authored by the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. In fact, the age group prescribed opioids at the highest rate—those older than 65—has the lowest rate of addiction and overdose. (And no, this research was not funded by Big Pharma, even though they used some of it extremely dishonestly.)\r\nIt is difficult to stop drug-seeking teens by leaving grandma in agony. Policies aimed at minimizing leftover pills prescribed for acute pain make sense—as does providing secure storage for needed meds. But our current strategy of reducing prescribing for chronic pain has failed.\r\nWhile care is needed when applying tobacco history to opioid policy, the settlements do offer one clear cautionary lesson: use the money well.\r\nSome $246 billion has already been paid out by cigarette makers—but nearly all of it falls into states’ general funds. In the 2021 fiscal year, for instance, less than 3 percent of the $27 billion allocated goes directly to smoking cessation and prevention.\r\nTo do better, we must target opioid funds narrowly and spend them smartly. This means moving away from cutting supply and toward offering help.\r\nFirst, doctors must be allowed to continue prescribing forpatients who already take opioids—without fear that doing so responsibly will cost them their license or their freedom. The millions of “legacy patients”—and future patients who have exhausted other options—need a legal safe haven so that they are not killed by dose reductions intended to save them.\r\nSecond, people with addiction need better care: arrest or expulsion from medical practices because of suspicion of misuse is not treatment. When physicians diagnose opioid addiction, they should legally be able to prescribe methadone or buprenorphine on the spot rather than having to send patients to restrictive clinics. In addition, no rehab that fails to offer medications or disparages them should receive government or insurance funding.\r\nIn short, we need to spend settlement funds on proved, effective care—and stop prioritizing\r\nprescription monitoring and enforcement. Despite their dangers, there is currently no substitute for these drugs. While a world without smoking is desirable, one without opioids is a world of pain.\r\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.': ""{'PERSON': ['None'], 'DATE': ['None'], 'LOC': ['None'], 'ORG': ['JAMA', 'National Institute on Drug Abuse', 'Scientific American'], 'PROGRAMS': ['prescription-monitoring databases', 'prosecution of “pill mill” physicians'], 'IMPACT': ['Since 2011 prescribing has fallen by at least 60 percent, largely thanks to ramped up prescription-monitoring databases and prosecution of “pill mill” physicians.

"{'Deaths of despair have risen during the coronavirus pandemic, and latest research suggests the increase has been dramatic.The pandemic and recession were associated with a 10% to 60% increase in deaths of despair above already high pre-pandemic levels, according to a working paper by Casey Mulligan, professor of economics at the University of Chicago. These non-COVID excess deaths are disproportionately experienced by men aged 15-55, including men aged 15-25, he found.From March onward, excess deaths are approximately 250,000 of which about 17,000 appear to be a COVID under-count and 30,000 non-COVID. Deaths of despair drug overdose, suicide, alcohol in 2017 and 2018 are good predictors of the demographic groups with NCEDs in 2020, Mulligan wrote in his paper, distributed Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\r\n“\r\n Mortality in 2020 significantly exceeds what would have occurred if official COVID deaths were combined with a normal number of deaths from other causes.\r\n ”\r\n Casey Mulligan, professor of economics at the University of Chicago\r\nMortality in 2020 significantly exceeds what would have occurred if official COVID deaths were combined with a normal number of deaths from other causes. The demographic and time patterns of the non-COVID excess deaths (NCEDs) point to deaths of despair rather than an under-count of COVID deaths. They increased steadily from March to June and then plateaued. \r\nThey were disproportionately experienced by working aged men, including men as young as aged 15 to 24. Presumably social isolation is part of the mechanism that turns a pandemic into a wave of deaths of despair, Mulligan said. However, he did not speculate on how much, if any, comes from government stay-at-home or business closures to encourage social distancing. \r\nOthers advise caution on such estimates. We do not actually know that these deaths are increasing during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and associate professor of emergency medicine and public health at Brown University, and Jessica Gold, a psychiatrist and assistant professor of psychiatry at Washington University in St. Louis.\r\nIn an op-ed for the health site Stat, they said, Police and crisis hot lines may or may not be receiving extra calls for domestic violence and child abuse. Firearm homicide rates are staying steady. Suicides are certainly occurring, but there is no evidence to date that their rate is on the rise (and we may not know the impact of the pandemic on suicide for years to come).\r\nDespite ample evidence that anxiety is increasing during the pandemic, anxiety alone is rarely a driver for suicide. It is not even a risk factor for it, Ranney and Gold added. Right now it is all too easy to blame every tragedy on COVID-19. Science warns us, however, not to make this fundamental error of attribution.\r\nPeople are, of course, suffering economically. At the height of the pandemic in March, more than 30 million Americans were laid off or furloughed when the economy shut down to curb the spread of COVID-19. The unemployment rate at that point was 14.7%; it has since come down to 6.7%. The leisure and hospitality industries have been particularly hit hard by the pandemic.\r\nIn April, nearly 12 million low-wage workers were laid off, while some 6 million workers who were earning between $18 to $29 an hour were laid off. By November, all but 400,000 of those workers earning $18 to $29 an hour had returned to work, Raj Chetty, a Harvard economics professor, said. Meanwhile, some 6 million workers who earned less than $13 an hour have yet to return to work.\r\nAs of Monday, COVID-19 has infected over 85.2 million people worldwide, which mostly does not account for asymptomatic cases, and killed 1.8 million, including 351,590 in the U.S. The U.S. has the worlds highest number of COVID-19 cases (20.6 million), followed by India (10.3 million), Brazil (7.7 million) and Russia (3.2 million), according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University.\r\nMulligan measured actual deaths from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention file for 2020 that begins on Jan. 26, and ended his calculations through week 40 the week ending Oct. 3. COVID-19 deaths and actual total deaths are reported in this file. He defined excess deaths as the difference between actual total deaths and projected deaths, based on previous years.\r\nThe CDC reports 12-month moving sums of deaths from drug overdose, Mulligan wrote. During the nine months before the pandemic, each new moving figure of none-COVID excess deaths (or NCEDs) averaged 680 deaths more than the previous. In March 2020, however, they totaled 1,511 above the previous total. \r\nThe same CDC data through May 2020 show that synthetic opioids such as fentanyl are driving the increases. Given that men have a larger share of fentanyl-overdose deaths than prescription-opioid-overdose deaths, this suggests that men would be disproportionately represented among 2020 NCEDs, he concluded. \r\nSome health professionals have warned of a rise in the epidemic of deaths of despair in the U.S. In fact, approximately 75,000 more people will likely die from drug or alcohol misuse and suicide as a result, according to predictions released last March by Well Being Trust and the Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care.\r\n“\r\n A complex constellation of risk factors, only a few of which are directly tied to COVID-19, are known to drive these tragic deaths.\r\n ”\r\n Megan Ranney, an emergency physician, and Jessica Gold, a psychiatrist, writing in Stat\r\nProjections of additional deaths of despair range from 27,644, assuming a quick economic recovery and the smallest impact from unemployment, to 154,037, assuming a slow recovery and the greatest impact from unemployment. We can prevent these deaths by taking meaningful and comprehensive action as a nation, the researchers wrote in the report.\r\nMore Americans could lose their lives to deaths of despair, deaths due to drug, alcohol, and suicide, if we do not do something immediately, the report said. Deaths of despair have been on the rise for the last decade, and in the context of COVID-19, deaths of despair should be seen as the epidemic within the pandemic.\r\nHowever, Ranney and Gold said those results should be taken with some serious caveats. These projections are based on data from the Great Recession, meaning the models werent able to factor in the unique aspects of what is happening today, such as how new technologies make possible increased virtual social connection and support, they added.\r\nA complex constellation of risk factors, only a few of which are directly tied to COVID-19, are known to drive these tragic deaths, they wrote. We have evidence-based interventions that can reduce the rates of many of the risk factors for all of these deaths whether or not the country is practicing social distancing, hand-washing, and mask wearing.\r\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly warned that efforts to stem the rapid spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, are spiraling the economy into another Great Recession; the impact has sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average \r\n DJIA,\r\n +0.65%\r\n\xa0ricocheting wildly in recent months. \r\nThe federal government must fully support and invest in a plan to improve mental-health care, said Benjamin Miller, chief strategy officer at the Well Being Trust. If we work to put in place healthy community conditions, good health-care coverage, and inclusive policies, we can improve mental health and well-being, he added.\r\nThe Well Being Trust is a national foundation dedicated to advancing the mental, social, and spiritual health of the nation. The Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care is an independent research unit affiliated with the American Academy of Family Physicians, and works to improve individual and population health by enhancing the delivery of primary care. \r\nDont miss: New estimates on coronavirus fatalities make for chilling reading as U.S. states ease restrictions on social distancing\r\nAnne Case and Angus Deaton, economists at Princeton University, first chronicled these deaths of despair among middle-aged non-Hispanic caucasians since 1999. They include deaths by suicide, alcohol poisoning, overdoses of opioids and other drugs, and cirrhosis of the liver. The CDC estimates theyve almost doubled since 1999, reaching 150,000 in 2017.\r\nSARS CoV-2 is having an unprecedented impact on the world. No one alive can recall any infection or worldwide event of such magnitude and scale, the new report added. Along with the tens of thousands of deaths in the United States from the virus, COVID-19 overlays the growing epidemic of deaths of despair threatening to make an already significant problem even worse. \r\nThe researchers issued a warning for the months and even years ahead, arguing for additional investment in health care and strategies to deal with the phenomenon. A preventable surge of avoidable deaths from drugs, alcohol, and suicide is ahead of us if the country does not begin to invest in solutions that can help heal the nations isolation, pain, and suffering, they wrote. \r\nThe debate over the ramifications of a months-long shutdown of the American economy has been at times both emotional and sobering. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for more than three decades and one of the leading experts in the U.S. on infectious diseases, has pleaded with people to socially distance.\r\nThe debate over the economys survival vs. the public health emergency highlights, as well, the chasm between left and right on the American political spectrum. The left generally believes that strong social structures beget a stronger economy for all. The right traditionally follows the idea that a strong economic system begets strong social structures for all.\r\nRanney and Gold argue that drawing a line between deaths of despair and political policies to reduce social distancing is a crude one. It is also wrong to imply that reopening the country will, in and of itself, stop deaths of despair. Jobs may or may not rebound when social distancing rules are relaxed. Much of the decline in travel and eating in restaurants predated formal rules about social distancing.': ""{'PERSON': ['Casey Mulligan', 'Megan Ranney', 'Jessica Gold', 'Raj Chetty', 'Benjamin Miller', 'Anne Case', 'Angus Deaton', 'Anthony Fauci'], 'DATE': ['Monday', 'March', '2020', 'March 2020', 'May 2020', 'last decade', '1999', '2017'], 'LOC': ['Chicago', 'Brown University', 'Washington University in St. Louis', 'the U.S.', 'India', 'Brazil', 'Russia', 'Johns Hopkins University'], 'ORG': ['University of Chicago', 'National Bureau of Economic Research', 'Brown University', 'Washington University', 'Harvard', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Well Being Trust', 'Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases', 'American Academy of Family Physicians'], 'PROGRAMS': ['resource hub', 'good health-care coverage'], 'IMPACT': ['10% to 60% increase in deaths of despair', 'excess deaths are approximately 250,000', 'Mortality in 2020 significantly exceeds what would have occurred', 'We can prevent these deaths', 'more people will likely die from drug or alcohol misuse and suicide', 'can reduce the rates of many of the risk factors', 'work to put in place healthy community conditions', 'can improve mental health and well-being', 'almost doubled since 1999, reaching 150,000']}""}"
"{'On March 1 the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case that could have an enormous impact on American medicine. The case, which involves combined appeals from two doctors, Xiulu Ruan and Shakeel Kahn, is intended to resolve an important question that has had a chilling effect on both pain and addiction care. If the court decides against these defendants, people in the U.S. who are in agony may be unable to get needed relief.\r\nThe legal issue is this: Must prosecutors prove that doctors accused of overprescribing controlled substances intended to act as drug dealers? Or can physicians unknowingly violate the standards of care so severely that they cross the line into criminal behavior?\r\nTo many, the answer is obvious: if doctors genuinely believe they are performing their duties as physicians and are following the law, they should not be charged with a crime. A surgeon, for instance, might do something that leads to a patient dying on the operating table, but in order for malpractice to be deemed murder, prosecutors must prove that the death was caused by more than a slip of the scalpel.\r\nWith controlled substances, however—especially during an overdose crisis that has now taken more than 100,000 lives in a single year—these issues have become more complicated.\xa0\r\nIn the case before the Supreme Court, the two doctors were charged with distributing drugs for profit after law enforcement became aware that they were writing large numbers of opioid prescriptions. In Ruan’s trial, prosecutors presented evidence that the doctor dramatically increased his prescribing of a form of fentanyl after making a $1.6 million-dollar investment in the stock of its manufacturer. Testimony about Kahn showed that many of his patients were selling the drugs he prescribed to them and that he had written prescriptions without performing examinations. Kahn was also charged with causing the overdose death of a patient. Ruan, who practiced in Alabama, was sentenced to 21 years in prison; Kahn, in Wyoming and Arizona, got 25 years.\r\nThe Supreme Court will not determine whether the physicians are innocent or guilty; instead it will focus on whether they should have the right to defend their actions as being done in good faith—a right their lawyers claim was infringed on because of improper jury instructions.\r\nThe case comes out of the disastrous U.S. policy response to rising rates of prescription opioid overdoses, which more than doubled between 1999 and 2010 as prescribing rates skyrocketed. The ambiguity in the law and the rising death rates made it easy for prosecutors to target physicians—and those prosecutions had the intended effect of scaring many doctors away from prescribing opioids, regardless of their patients’ needs.\r\nUnsurprisingly, this has had a harmful effect on pain care. A recent study found that between 2007 and 2017, opioid prescriptions for people with terminal cancer fell by nearly 40 percent, despite the fact that there is little connection between end-of-life care and the overdose crisis, and despite policies and standards that explicitly exempt such patients from opioid cutbacks.\r\nThe situation for people with intractable chronic pain is even worse: thousands have had their doses reduced or eliminated by doctors who fear prosecution for accidental drug trafficking. Research has shown that rather than reducing harm to patients, such cuts can dramatically increase their risk for suicide and overdose.\r\nTo top it all off, restrictions on prescription opioids have not reduced overdose deaths in general. Instead the number of deaths more than doubled between 2011 and 2020; in that same period opioid prescribing was cut by more than half, and it is now back to precrisis levels.\r\nAddiction care is also undermined by this legal uncertainty. The only two treatments proven to reduce the death rate from opioid use disorder by half or more—methadone and buprenorphine—are themselves controlled substances. During an overdose crisis that is now driven by the illegal manufacturing and sale of fentanyl and other powerful synthetic opioids, experts agree that it is essential to make these medications more easily available.\r\nBut the Drug Enforcement Administration tends to see addiction clinics with few restrictions as pill mills. If a person with addiction can visit a doctor and get controlled substances without frequent urine testing, without the requirement of abstinence from other substances and without mandatory counseling, law enforcement may view that physician as a drug dealer, not a doctor.\r\nResearch, however, shows that even without these requirements—which often deter people from seeking needed help—the medications themselves save lives. The Supreme Court held over a different doctor’s case related to this issue so it can be reconsidered in light of the decision they make on Ruan and Kahn’s case.\r\nSometimes the difference between dealing and doctoring is obvious. If a physician sells controlled drugs for a fee (“doses for dollars”) without even the pretense of an examination or consideration of medical issues, or if a doctor trades drugs for sex or controlled substances for illegal drugs, it is clearly a crime.\r\nThis distinction is essentially written into the relevant law: for a prescription for a controlled substance to be legal, it “must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a practitioner acting in the usual course of professional practice.”\r\nBut aggressive prosecutions during the overdose crisis have blurred the lines between criminal behavior and malpractice. Courts have convicted physicians—including, their lawyers argue, Ruan and Kahn—for prescribing medication to more patients and in higher doses than other doctors do, not for deliberate dealing.\r\nProsecutors have based their cases in part on guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2016, and they have argued successfully that dosing outside the amounts mentioned in the guidelines is “not a legitimate medical purpose.”\r\n“We saw prosecutors using the CDC guidelines as evidence for their expert witnesses,” says Ronald Chapman, an attorney who specializes in defending physicians accused of improperly prescribing drugs.\r\n“The government would target physicians for prosecution based on the amount of medication they were prescribing—not on patient outcomes or sort of general factors of dangerousness to the patient population,” Chapman adds, explaining that by searching through prescription-monitoring databases, law enforcement can simply designate the doctor who prescribed the most opioids to patients in a particular city or state as a criminal. “The doctors who ended up with the largest target on their back were the pain management professionals who were taking the most problematic patients,” he says.\r\nKate Nicholson is an attorney, person with personal experience of chronic pain and founder of the National Pain Advocacy Center, a nonprofit that does not accept industry funding. “The reason we got involved is because we’ve seen a chilling effect on patient care where doctors are not willing to exercise even their best medical judgment because they fear oversight,” says Nicholson, whose group filed an amicus brief in the Ruan case.\r\n“It causes a race to the bottom,” Chapman says, explaining how pain specialists have abandoned patients or unilaterally cut their doses in order to avoid legal scrutiny. Nicholson and her fellow advocates say they hear frequently from patients who are in extreme distress because medications they have been prescribed safely for years were suddenly taken away.\r\nIn this particular case, the government contends that “a doctor who makes a mistake in construing or applying those standards is not criminally liable so long as he has made an objectively reasonable good-faith effort to learn and comply with medical norms. A doctor who fails to take even that modest step, however, has abandoned the medical profession altogether and cannot seek its shelter.” And, it argues, that is what these defendants did.\r\nBut the defendants—and amicus briefs from pain patient advocates, such as Nicholson’s organization, and others such as the Chamber of Commerce—argue that it is wrong to criminalize merely departing from the standard of care. If doctors believe they are practicing medicine and helping their patients, they should not be accused of being drug dealers subject to decades in prison. If the problem is that they are bad doctors, medical boards and malpractice charges can stop them from doing harm.\r\nBecause circuit courts are split on this critical question, the Supreme Court chose to take these two doctors’ cases and combine them into one to address it. Ideally, it will decide that convicting doctors for dealing does require mens rea—a guilty mind—and that a good-faith defense must be allowed when these cases are tried.\r\nThe CDC is also revising its 2016 guidelines, having recognized that their rigid application by physicians and use by prosecutors to target doctors is harming patients. (Comments on the new guidelines will be open until April 11.)\r\nI hope these actions will begin to put an end to the enormous damage currently being done to people with chronic pain who require opioids.\r\nThe conservative majority on the Supreme Court is, unusually, likely to benefit the defendants in this case. Conservative jurisprudence tends to favor mens rea requirements for businesspeople charged with crimes. With the Supreme Court’s help, perhaps America can finally find a true balance between restricting the use of potentially dangerous drugs and allowing those who benefit from them to have appropriate access.': ""{'PERSON': ['Xiulu Ruan', 'Shakeel Kahn', 'Vivian Peng', 'Ronald Chapman', 'Kate Nicholson'], 'DATE': ['March 1', 'between 1999 and 2010', 'between 2007 and 2017', 'between 2011 and 2020', 'until April 11'], 'LOC': ['U.S.', 'Alabama', 'Wyoming', 'Arizona'], 'ORG': ['Supreme Court', 'Drug Enforcement Administration', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'National Pain Advocacy Center'], 'PROGRAMS': ['None'], 'IMPACT': ['An enormous impact on American medicine', 'People in the U.S. who are in agony may be unable to get needed relief', 'Had a chilling effect on both pain and addiction care', 'Scaring many doctors away from prescribing opioids, regardless of their patients’ needs', 'Harmful effect on pain care', 'Thousands have had their doses reduced or eliminated by doctors who fear prosecution for accidental drug trafficking', 'Increases risk for suicide and overdose', 'Has not reduced overdose deaths', 'Undermined addiction care']}""}"

The reporting resulted in this\xa0five-part series exploring\xa0the reality of pain, pain medications,\xa0nondrug alternatives for children and adults, and scientific advances offering hope for the future.\r\nThe vast majority of chronic pain patients will have stories about providers who have been dismissive, said Dr. Tina\xa0Doshi, a pain expert at the\xa0Johns Hopkins\xa0University School of Medicine.\r\nThey are told their pain is imagined, all in their head.

Experts believe opioid addiction only increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nYet nothing else is as effective at treating excruciating pain. Efforts to keep\xa0opioids off the street have often gone overboard, experts say, depriving those in real need.\r\nPamela Bobb of Tennessee, has been in pain her whole life. She manages it with a combination of meditative breathing, diet, exercise, yoga and medications.\r\nTamara Reynolds, For USA TODAY\r\nPatients like Bobb and others\xa0say they shouldn\'t be treated as addicts looking for a fix, but rather\xa0as people with a serious medical problem that needs attention and support.\r\nRobert Kerns\r\nCourtesy Robert Kerns\r\nFederal guidance, updated last month, makes it clear that unless there\'s a life-threatening\xa0issue such as signs of overdose, doctors should not abruptly discontinue or rapidly reduce\xa0opioid dosages.\xa0After an earlier set of guidelines restricted opioid use even among those in severe chronic pain,\xa0an online survey of about 3,000 patients\xa0found 84% reported more pain and worse quality of life, and 42% said they had considered suicide.\r\n""Separate\xa0but related to the opioid crisis is the public health crisis of undermanaged pain,"" said Robert Kerns, an expert in chronic pain at Yale University, noting that every drugstore in American has an entire aisle devoted to painkillers. ""This is a very serious public health concern.""\r\nAfter Bobb gritted\xa0her way through her 30s and 40s, her pain eventually became unbearable. In 2004, her doctor prescribed\xa0high doses of opioids. She didn\'t develop an addiction, but she didn\'t like what the opioids did to her brain and how they made her feel like a victim. ""I wasn\'t really living. I was just kind of existing,"" she said.\r\nEven when opioids don\'t lead to addiction, as they do in about 10% of people, they have side effects. Terrible constipation is common, as are nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, powerfully itchy skin\xa0and feelings of sedation\xa0 sleepwalking through life.\r\nAbout five years ago, Bobb, a nurse\xa0now semi-retired, decided she needed to take a different\xa0path.\r\nNow, every morning\xa0she washes a small dose of opioids down with an anti-inflammatory\xa0""special little concoction"" for breakfast, stir-frying fresh ginger, rosemary, basil, lemon juice and three cups of spinach.\r\nThe meditation, diet and other strategies have helped her\xa0cut her opioid use by about 75%.\xa0\r\nAll pain medications,\xa0including opioids,\xa0over-the-counter painkillers\xa0and nerve blockers, blunt\xa0but don\'t erase suffering. They often become inadequate over time or even contribute to the cycle of pain and desperate search for relief. Misused, every drug treatment\xa0can\xa0destroy\xa0organs and lives.\r\n""A cold hard look at what we have right now should depress anyone,"" said Jeffrey Mogil,\xa0who studies pain at McGill University in Montreal.\xa0\r\nDr. Nora Volkow\r\nKeren Carrion, USAT\r\nBut just because a pill can\'t solve chronic pain doesn\'t mean people are doomed to suffer forever,\xa0said Dr. Nora\xa0Volkow,\xa0who directs the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The institute is part of\xa0the National Institutes of Health, which has spent more than\xa0$600 million since 2020\xa0on pain research.\r\nMany approaches help reduce pain, and many people, like Bobb, manage to live full, vibrant lives, despite\xa0a background of discomfort. Non-pharmaceutical therapies including physical therapy, yoga, acupuncture and Bobb\'s meditative breathing have been shown effective at helping people cope with pain.\r\nWhile providers can offer guidance, support and access to certain kinds of care, fundamentally, people need to learn how to manage their own pain, Kerns said.\r\n""It\'s really about reinforcing the power of the person,"" he said, ""once they understand how much of the experience of pain is within their grasp.""\r\nPain is an essential part of life. It\'s protective and aids\xa0survival.\r\nIn a classic experiment, squid\xa0put in a tank with sea bass are less likely to get eaten if they\'re already in pain. The suffering makes the squid hypervigilant.\xa0""Pain is there to remind you you\'re injured so you don\'t take crazy chances,"" Mogil said.\r\nIsaac Chiu\r\nHarvard Medical School\r\nPain can be protective in other ways, too.\xa0Isaac Chiu, an immunologist at\xa0Harvard Medical School, recently showed\xa0that pain triggers the gut to release\xa0mucus, which coats the gut wall and prevents bacteria and other factors\xa0from\xa0causing\xa0damage.\xa0\r\nMice bred to not have pain fibers in their guts have decreased mucus, which makes them more susceptible to inflammation and colitis, Chiu found.\r\n""I don\'t want to have pain, but maybe in this case, the pain fibers in the gut are protecting us,"" he said.\r\nBut pain is not just the result of an immediate crisis, a twisted ankle, a burned finger, a broken limb. Chronic pain is defined as suffering that lasts more than three months\xa0 longer than it takes that\xa0ankle muscle to be restored, the finger to scab over and grow new skin, the bone to heal.\r\nSuch long-lasting misery\xa0has what\'s called a psychosocial aspect to it. Of course, unrelenting\xa0pain itself is depressing. But if your life is a dead end with few prospects for improvement, you\'re more likely to feel chronic pain. That hopelessness manifests in physical suffering.\r\nHow some Americans feel pain at the extremes: constantly, intensely, or never.\r\nFrom intense, chronic pain to no pain at all, some Americans experience that sharp sense of danger in a very different way.\r\nIt doesn\'t mean the pain is made up;\xa0rather, what\'s going on in your head can magnify or mitigate the sensation.\xa0A busy life full of compelling activities can distract from pain; a lonely life spent on the couch can compound it.\r\nThe high pain rates in the United States have a lot\xa0""to do with just poor general health in our country,"" said Dr. John Mafi,\xa0a\xa0primary care doctor and\xa0associate professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.\r\nPeople who have few financial resources\xa0or are from disadvantaged groups or both are more likely to have poorhealth, which contributes to pain. Obesity can trigger arthritis and low back problems; diabetes causes neuropathic pain; bad circulation can cause painful\xa0blocked arteries. Mental illness and stress exacerbate all kinds of pain, such as chronic migraine headaches. Limited or lack of health insurance coverage compounds all these problems.\r\n""We love to talk about magic pills in this country, but we don\'t ask enough: What are the social, psychosocial\xa0and economic\xa0root causes of this bigger issue?"" Mafi said.\xa0\r\nThe human nervous system has its own painkillers. Put your hand on a hot stove and your body will quickly release a squirt to numb the pain.\xa0\r\nFor thousands of years, maybe even longer, humans have relied on opioids in nature to supplement that innate pain relief. The ancient\xa0Sumerians\xa0and Greeks knew all about the pain-relieving potential of poppy seeds. Civil War veterans became addicted to opioids.\xa0\r\nStories about opium and morphine use from 1900 ""read just like today,"" Mafi said. ""It\'s crazy how much of this repeats over time.""\r\nIn the 1920s and \'30s, the federal government passed regulations restricting their use. Then in the 1980s and 1990s, amid\xa0a growing recognition that severe pain was undertreated,\xa0the pharmaceutical industry reassured the public that new twists on opioids, like oxycontin, were less addictive than earlier forms. ""We fell for it,"" Mafi said.\r\nOpioids are properly used as third- or fourth-line therapies in patients who cannot function normally without chronic pain relief, he said. He trains residents to consider opioids after determining the underlying cause of the chronic pain, other conservative approaches have failed, and when a patient\xa0says their pain prevents them from climbing stairs, showering, holding down a job or taking\xa0care of\xa0their kids or grandkids. If such activities of daily living are impaired, Mafi said, ""we would be a\xa0little more willing to continue opioids or prescribe the opioids.""\r\nMillions of people, prescribed courses of opioids for pain from sports injuries and other seemingly short-term sources of pain, began\xa0taking the drugs long-term, needing more and more to receive the same amount of pain relief.\r\nIn the early 2010s, as awareness of the problem rose, doctors stopped providing unlimited supplies. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended doctors ""deprescribe"" their patients, which led to unexpected consequences.\xa0\r\nDr. John Mafi\r\nAs it got harder to get prescribed opioids, people stopped trying to get it from their doctor and they started to go to the street. Thats when you started seeing a rise in heroin use and then later, illicit fentanyl use leading to a lot of the overdose deaths.\r\n""As it got harder to get prescribed opioids, people stopped trying to get it from their doctor and they started to go to the street,"" Mafi said. ""That\'s when you started seeing a rise in heroin use and then later, illicit fentanyl use leading to a lot of the overdose deaths."" By 2021, studies had\xa0linked aggressive deprescribing to an increased\xa0risk of overdose or death.\xa0\r\nIt used to take several years for a heroin\xa0addiction to lead to overdose and death. Now, with extremely potent fentanyl, people are overdosing as early as their first foray, Mafi said.\r\nThe opioid crisis resulted from aggressive promotion by pharmaceutical companies and others, overprescribing of opioid medications\xa0and\xa0a lack of investment in pain treatment research, Volkow said.\r\n""What the crisis brought to light is that we cannot continue to neglect the importance of research and facilitating the development of therapeutics for pain.""\r\nShe and other pain experts\xa0agree that there isn\'t much else to offer at the moment and that\xa0opioids are appropriate and necessary for people like Bobb, as well as for patients after surgery or trauma and those fighting the pain of advanced cancer.\r\nBut not everyone, even in the medical world, understands the correct use of opioids. Patients\' pain is often poorly controlled.\r\nBobb switched doctors after hers abruptly decided she shouldn\'t be taking opioids anymore. She\xa0now drives 110 miles each way every month to see a different\xa0physician\xa0and\xa0worries about the patients who\xa0can\'t make such choices.\xa0\r\nMany people ""don\'t understand that using opioids doesn\'t make you a criminal,"" Bobb said. ""There\'s a place for this. There\'s a usefulness for this.""\r\nJeffrey Mogil\xa0knows he\'s going against common wisdom when he says women are more sensitive to pain\xa0than men.\r\nBut the research is clear.\xa0""The evidence is as close to incontrovertible as anything gets in biology."" About 70% of chronic pain patients are women.\r\nJeffrey Mogil\r\nMcGill University\r\nDifferent genes and cells are involved in pain between\xa0the sexes. The immune system, the\xa0nervous system and the microbes that live on and in the body vary\xa0between males and females. ""It\'s just massively different,"" Mogil said, noting current treatments and drug\xa0development don\'t take account of that sex difference, with drugs often tested just in male mice.\r\nPain also differs by age.\r\n""The aging population has more sources of pain but the nervous system is not as healthy,"" so pain isn\'t felt as acutely,\xa0said Dr.\xa0Christopher Gharibo, a pain management specialist at NYU Langone. Older patients need less powerful pain medications. ""They\'re fine with physical therapy,"" he said.\xa0\r\nPain differs by race, too, though not in a simple way.\r\nChronic pain is felt pretty universally by all races, said Roger Fillingim,\xa0who directs the Pain Research and Intervention Center of Excellence\xa0at the University of Florida\'s College of Dentistry in Gainesville. But ""the burden of pain appears to be greater in Black individuals,"" he said, with more people of color suffering disabling pain.\r\nHistoric and current undertreatment of pain in Black people has been persistent and based on the false belief that\xa0they feel less pain.\r\nIn fact, Fillingim and others have found the opposite: Black people report\xa0higher levels of pain with the same stimulus and lower tolerance of a given pain stimulus compared with white people. Whether Black people need more powerful painkillers to get the same relief\xa0or just need to get the added stress of racism out of the equation isn\'t yet known, he said.\r\nCulture also affects pain.\r\nIn Mexico, people are rarely prescribed opioids, said Volkow, who grew up there, and the Catholic culture venerates pain as a way of proving faith. ""People\xa0are taught to tolerate pain at a level that is different from what it is in the United States,"" she said. ""There is absolutely a cultural element of how we manage pain and its significance.""\r\nThe indigenous Mi\'kmaq people, whose ancestral territory stretches across Nova Scotia, Canada, down to Quebec and into Maine, don\'t have a word in their native language\xa0for ""pain,"" and the pictures doctors show of grimacing faces to rate misery don\'t fit their experience.\r\nSharon Rudderham\r\nJohn Ratchford, Ratchford Photography\r\n""It goes right to the core of the disconnect,"" said Sharon Rudderham,\xa0a member of the Mi\'kmaq who is director of health transformation\xa0for the health organization Tajikeimik.\xa0""We\xa0are literally speaking a different language when it comes to pain.""\r\nProviders are taught to assess pain in children based on outward signs, such as crying and facial expression, but because of their history and negative experiences in Canadian residential schools, similar to American Indian boarding schools, many Mi\'kmaq, even very young children, remain reserved around doctors and nurses.""\xa0\r\n""As a health provider, if I\'m looking at children in an emergency department\xa0and one is crying and screaming and looking uncomfortable and one isn\'t, the one looking more uncomfortable may be triaged sooner,"" said Margot Latimer,\xa0a professor at the Dalhousie School of Nursing in Halifax, Canada.\r\nThe\xa0zero to 10 scale doctors use for patients to rate their pain\xa0can also be challenging, especially for those\xa0without\xa0much\xa0experience with the medical system, said Carmen Reneé Green,\xa0dean of the CUNY School of Medicine.\xa0\r\n""A zero\xa0to 10 scale makes great sense for clinicians, but it doesn\'t work well for patients in many, many cases,"" Green said, particularly those who have traditionally received substandard medical care.\r\n""All\xa0those histories come into how we perceive pain, how pain is assessed and how pain is treated,"" Green said. ""We\'ve got to do better.""\r\nAfter about 15 years of taking\xa0high-dose opioids, Bobb made an appointment with Dr. Wayne Jonas, an integrative health\xa0specialist in Virginia.\r\nHe taught her strategies to manage the pain that opioids weren\'t touching.\r\nBobb said her pain used to be at a 9 out of 10 all day every day. Now, it usually hovers around a 3. It\'s not gone, but it\'s not paralyzing either.\xa0\r\nAfter her light dose of opioids\xa0and anti-inflammatory breakfast, Bobb allows herself an hour to move.\r\nDepending on how she feels that day, she might go for a brisk walk on her treadmill, do yoga\xa0or meditate some more. Exercise, she said, ""helps\xa0me to be at that level where I can function well.""\xa0\r\nPeace, diet &amp; meditation: how one chronic pain patient has learned to deal with discomfort\r\nChronic pain can be invisible, constant, and unbearable. Pamela Bobb, of Eastern Tennessee, has never known life without it.\r\nShe drinks water throughout the day and notices that her pain is worse if she doesn\'t sleep enough.\r\nIf her pain does start to\xa0wear\xa0her down, Bobb takes a time-out in her favorite chair. ""My space, my corner, my view, and just bring it down. Just bring it down.""\r\nFiguring out how to do what was best for her body took about a decade of trial and error. Time, energy and attitude change are all essential, she said, plus prioritizing self-care.\xa0\r\n""The key is stopping, turning, facing it, feeling it in all of its glory. Feeling every aspect of it and coming up with a way to say:\xa0\'No, no.\xa0The pain doesn\'t win,\'"" Bobb said.\xa0\r\nShe wishes other people coping with chronic pain could have the advantages she\'s had: a good doctor, attentive nurses, the time and resources to take care of herself. And most of all, hope.\r\n""If someone can understand that having a sense of empowerment over the pain by learning everything you can to treat it, to control it,"" she said, ""maybe they won\'t feel as overwhelmed and hopeless.""\r\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com.\r\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.
