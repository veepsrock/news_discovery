Although people from all walks of life die each day from overdoses, poverty stands out as a driver of this staggering toll. The risk of dying from an overdose is 36 percent higher among people living at or below the poverty line, compared with people living at five times that line, a typical middle class income.
That’s why expansion of Medicaid, the state and federal health insurance program for low-income individuals, has been hailed as an essential policy to prevent this disproportionate suffering. Implemented in 40 states, Medicaid expansion is a pillar of the Affordable Care Act that extends its coverage to all adults living at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty line (equivalent to a yearly income of $20,120 for an individual). Health insurance can help tackle the overdose crisis because it allows people in need to afford substance use disorder treatment, and treatment is a highly effective way to reduce overdoses.
So far, however, Medicaid expansion has not fully realized its lifesaving potential for helping to end the overdose epidemic. One reason why is that it takes more than insurance alone to stave off overdoses.

In fact, our recent analysis of all overdose deaths in the U.S. from 2008 to 2018 found that Medicaid expansion did not prevent fatal overdoses among people facing poverty; the opioid overdose mortality rate was the same—about 14.5 deaths per 100,000 residents—in states that expanded Medicaid and in states that did not.
This was not the result we expected.
So, we dug deeper by analyzing nationwide data gathered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on people who inject drugs. We looked at 19,946 people who subsisted below 138 percent of the poverty line (Medicaid expansion’s eligibility threshold). Some of the states we analyzed had expanded Medicaid, while others had not, allowing us to compare individuals who injected drugs in states that had and had not expanded coverage.
These comparisons highlight a breakdown in a key pathway that should link Medicaid expansion to improved substance use disorder treatment and thus to reduced overdoses. In a sign of the policy’s success, we found
 that insurance coverage rates increased by 19 percentage points among people facing poverty who inject drugs and live in states that had expanded Medicaid, while rates remained unchanged among similar residents of states that had not. Moreover, we also found
 people experienced a nine percentage point increase in their probability of getting needed medical care if they lived in expansion states, with no parallel bump in states that did not expand Medicaid.
Strikingly, increased rates of insurance did not,however, lead to increased utilization of substance use disorder treatment; we found
 no difference in treatment use across these two groups of people who inject drugs. Other studies have reached similar conclusions.
So, why might health insurance not be enough to effectively link people to treatment? First, the U.S. has long suffered a marked shortage of treatment slots, so insured individuals who want treatment may still not be able to get it. For example, residential treatment programs operated at 90 percent capacity in 2022, but about three quarters of the people needing treatment that year did not receive it. We need investments to increase treatment capacity, particularly in low-income and rural areas, which have been historically underresourced.
Second, even with enhanced capacity, Medicaid expansion can only substantially impact overdoses among individuals facing poverty if treatment providers accept its insurance. Unfortunately, in 2020 only 71 percent of treatment facilities nationwide accepted Medicaid. Residents of expansion states do not fare better; a previous study by one of us found
 that Medicaid expansion did not result in greater increases in treatment programs accepting Medicaid in expansion states versus states that had not expanded. Low reimbursement rates are a longstanding barrier to provider acceptance of Medicaid. In 2021, the national average Medicaid reimbursement for methadone treatment—a common treatment for opioid use disorder—was nearly half that of Medicare, the federal insurance program for people age 65 and over. This Medicaid–Medicare reimbursement gap was larger than that seen for other services, including primary care. To help ensure that Medicaid expansion truly translates into increased financial access to substance use disorder treatment, policy makers must increase reimbursement for providers.
These days, people with an opioid use disorder don’t have to rely only on formal programs for treatment; they can also access the pharmaceutical treatment buprenorphine through their primary care physicians and other health care providers. Buprenorphine is a highly effective medication to treat opioid use disorder that also greatly reduces overdose risk. “Secret shopper” studies in which undercover researchers pose as potential patients, however, have found that potential patients struggle to get appointments with physicians who prescribe buprenorphine when they disclose that they are on Medicaid. Increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates, bolstering buprenorphine prescribing among providers within federally qualified health centers (which provide care for low-income individuals) and expanding the role of telemedicine are three pathways toward effectively linking insured people in need to lifesaving treatment.
Finally, even insured individuals who can access treatment may still not be able to use it because of oppressive policies. Methadone, for example, is a highly effective treatment for opioid use disorder that also reduces overdoses. Federal law, however, requires that only specialized clinics can offer it, and that patients must come in person daily for observed medication dosing. These mandates are contemporary practices of the war on drugs, which created barriers to care by punishing even public health programming for drug-related harms. Daily travel to clinics may be impossible for people who have jobs, for people who lack transportation and for those juggling childcare or eldercare. These barriers are common among impoverished people who use drugs, particularly those who are Black, Indigenous or people of color, or those who live in rural communities.
During the COVID pandemic, the federal emergency declaration temporarily replaced these punitive policies with a more patient-centered model. Emergency policies permitted some patients to take home up to a 28-day supply of methadone. While this policy has remained in effect even after the federal emergency declaration ended, it is only temporary. The Department of Health and Human Services should make this policy permanent, and support states and treatment programs as they revise policies to support this federal change.
Our study showed expansion was successful at enrolling people facing poverty who use drugs in Medicaid, and that it also helped them access needed medical care. However, our analysis also served as a compelling reminder that insurance coverage alone is insufficient to reverse the overdose crisis for this vulnerable population, because it is not adequately connecting those in need to substance use disorder treatment. We must bolster treatment to meet demand, expand program and provider acceptance of Medicaid, and permanently relax oppressive methadone policies before another million lives are lost.

 Opioid addiction doesn’t get as many headlines as it used to, but the crisis is as bad as ever. It doesn’t have to be. The opioid crisis doesn’t get as many headlines as it used to before Covid-19, but the news remains stubbornly, shockingly bad. 
Decades into the deadliest drug overdose epidemic in American history, people are dying at higher rates than ever. Between 2017 and 2021, the number of overdose deaths involving opioids jumped from 47,600 to 80,411 — many more Americans than are killed each year by guns or cars. The surge has been largely driven by powerful synthetics like fentanyl, an opioid 50 times more potent than heroin. 
Provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show nearly as many opioid-involved overdose deaths in 2022, at 79,770. Overdoses in Black, American Indian, and Latinx communities have been rising even faster, widening the mortality gap between white people and people of color. In 2020, Black men 65 and older died of overdoses at seven times the rate of white men in the same age range. 
Meanwhile, the number of Americans struggling with opioid addiction remains staggering. In 2022, 6.1 million people 12 and older had an opioid use disorder, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s most recent annual survey, while 8.9 million reported misusing opioids within the past year. 
Looking at these statistics, I thought back to something that addiction specialist Sarah Wakeman told me when I was reporting on the opioid crisis five years ago. “Most people get better,” Wakeman, who is the senior medical director for substance use disorder at Mass General Brigham, said then. “That’s what we don’t ever talk about in the opioids conversation.” 
When she says “most people,” she means most people who get long-term medication-assisted treatment (MAT), widely considered the gold standard in addiction care. It combines regular counseling and behavioral therapy with the medication methadone or buprenorphine (often prescribed under the brand name Suboxone). Both contain synthetic opioid compounds, which prevent withdrawal and cravings, and they can lower overdoses by as much as 76 percent. (A third medication, less often used, is naltrexone, which blocks the high from opioids.) 
The philosophy of MAT — a departure from the moralizing, abstinence-based rehab and 12-step programs that dominated addiction care for most of the 20th century — began to take shape in the early 2000s, when the Food and Drug Administration approved buprenorphine and a federal law authorized primary care physicians to prescribe it. 
MAT shifted the treatment paradigm dramatically. Now, every overdose death is a tragedy, Wakeman told me, not because opioid addiction is unsolvable but because, like so many other chronic illnesses, it’s now very treatable. 
So why have we failed to stop or even significantly slow the opioid crisis? Why do nearly 90 percent of those with opioid use disorder still lack access to evidence-based treatment like MAT? 
This fall, I got back in touch with Wakeman and posed this question. Is the problem us, I asked her, or is it the opioids? “Oh, it’s definitely us,” she said. The addiction crisis is as much an “ideological challenge” as it is a medical one. 
“We, as a society, have spent more than 100 years thinking of and building policies and systems and punishments to address addiction as if it were an issue of morality,” Wakeman said. “And so even though now we’re starting to talk about it as a public health issue, our policies, our clinical approaches, our care models, our funding, really reflect this idea that we actually think people are doing something bad and so we should make it really hard on them.”
This punitive mindset contributes to a disproportionate emphasis on detox, “which happens to be the most lucrative, least effective element of recovery,” as Walter Ling, a UCLA psychiatrist and neurologist whose research helped pave the way for FDA approval of buprenorphine and other opioid addiction medications, put it in a recent op-ed. Even now, many drug rehab centers stress detoxification, meaning going off opioids rapidly, over MAT. A 2020 nationwide survey of inpatient programs found that only 29 percent offered a long-term MAT option; only one in eight residential treatment facilities for adolescents offered buprenorphine for long-term treatment, according to a study last June. 
Nearly every clinician I spoke to offered some version of this same observation about how culture and ideology restrict addiction care. “The main thing that’s holding us back is stigma,” said Brown University epidemiologist Josiah Rich, an adviser to the Rhode Island task force on overdoses, who has spent decades providing HIV and addiction care to people locked up in the state’s prisons. 
Physician and anthropologist Kimberly Sue, a professor at Yale and the author of Getting Wrecked: Women, Incarceration, and the American Opioid Crisis, told me about treating young people jailed at Rikers Island whose families had cut them off or kicked them out for using drugs. “The US is extremely culturally punitive,” she said. “You know, ‘Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps.’ ‘You made your bed, you lie in it.’ … We’re told that you’re a loser, you don’t deserve to live because you use drugs. You don’t deserve to be healthy.” 
Our approach to treatment hasn’t caught up with the science of what works best. “Until the medications came around, our treatment for opioid addiction was mostly a failure,” Ling told me. “Yet we put our philosophy, our idea, ahead of science, ahead of what we know.” That trickles down into how people interact with the health care system — and how structural barriers like racism and poverty compound the damage for those most susceptible to addiction. 
The war on drugs laid the foundation for dysfunctional addiction treatment
The face of opioid addiction in America changed dramatically over the past two decades. As overdoses soared in white and rural communities and the crisis was no longer concentrated in cities or communities of color, public discourse around addiction shifted. Experts and policymakers began talking urgently about “deaths of despair” among working-class white people, and a surge of sympathetic media attention sought to understand the problem through this new wave of victims. Americans increasingly began to see addiction the same way medical authorities had for decades — as an illness. 
Even so, our treatment paradigm has not caught up. Perhaps the clearest example of how Americans’ cultural mindset limits access to treatment is the onerous regulation of methadone. Patients can receive the medication only at federally certified clinics, which tend to be located in impoverished or high-crime neighborhoods. Most patients must appear at the clinic daily for months or years before they’re allowed to take home even a small number of doses. This means waiting in line, often for hours, missing appointments and work, having to arrange for child care. For some patients, it also means long commutes, sometimes across state lines. 
In stark contrast, buprenorphine can be prescribed in doctors’ offices and dispensed by pharmacies. Although the overdose risk with methadone is slightly higher than for buprenorphine, it is stigma, not science, that guides methadone regulations. The medication was initially introduced in the US in 1947 as a pain reliever and cough suppressant; researchers established its effectiveness at treating opioid addiction during the 1960s, amid a spike in heroin use that devastated Black urban communities. Back then, even more than now, Americans viewed addiction through the lens of criminality and deviance rather than disease, so federal regulations put in place in the early 1970s, just as Richard Nixon declared the “war on drugs,” walled off methadone from mainstream medical settings. That’s where it remains today, even though in countries like Canada, the UK, and Australia, where primary care doctors have been prescribing methadone for decades, it’s treated more like a normal medication.
The long lines outside methadone clinics is one of the main reasons people drop out of or never begin treatment with the medication. Because of these restrictions, methadone is “legendarily hated” among drug users, New York University sociologist David Frank, who is in recovery himself and has been taking methadone for 20 years, told me. 
In a recent study he published, one participant compared methadone treatment to “liquid handcuffs,” while another described the degrading experience of being told to keep waiting in line after her water broke. “Treatment is not set up to meet the actual needs of the population,” Frank said. “In fact, it’s a barrier to meeting those needs.” Most people come to treatment not because of a commitment to abstinence or even to cure a disease, but “to deal with the fact that the drug they’re dependent on is highly criminalized,” he said. “In my research, this comes up time and again. I ask people, why did you get on methadone? And they always tell the same story as mine: ‘I’m dope sick every day, it’s impossible. I get arrested, I’m scared, my life is falling apart.’ It’s a very pragmatic response. Methadone helps reduce those problems.” 
The punitive regulations flow largely from methadone’s history, providers say, from a time when heroin use was closely associated with Black Americans. When buprenorphine received FDA approval 40 years later, the opioid crisis was hitting white America, too. “People’s perceptions about methadone are really frozen in history,” said Paul Joudrey, a Pittsburgh-based addiction care doctor who, along with Frank, is on the board of the National Coalition to Liberate Methadone. 
Buprenorphine prescribers are far more common in segregated white communities, while methadone clinics are more prevalent in Black and Hispanic neighborhoods. Patients who are white, wealthy, and well-educated are more likely than Black or Hispanic patients to receive buprenorphine. Patients of color are often directed instead to methadone clinics — and even when they do receive buprenorphine, the average course of treatment is shorter. 
Our very ideas of what it means to recover are still bound up with the stigmatized, criminalized history of addiction. A common misconception among the public, experts told me, and even some care providers and people who use drugs themselves, is that recovery with buprenorphine or methadone isn’t “real” recovery; that it just replaces one addiction with another. 
“We think of addiction, which is a lifetime-long problem, as being like pneumonia or some other kind of infection,” Ling said. “You come off [the drugs], and then people say, ‘Why can’t they just go back to their old self?’ But they can’t. Substance use has irreversible effects on the body and the brain.” Some people need to stay on MAT for years or decades — and that’s okay, Ling says. 
Some experts push this argument further, challenging the notion that being in recovery necessarily means getting off drugs altogether. “My goals for my patients are that they are alive, healthy, and able to have a connected, meaningful life,” said Sue of Yale, who is the former medical director of the National Harm Reduction Coalition. “I do not care how much or what they use in order to achieve that.” For some people, that means strict sobriety; for others, it might mean using drugs less often, or using certain drugs but not others. Sue never mandates abstinence. “The first thing I always ask my patients is, ‘What are your goals, in regards to your substance use?’” Sue told me. “Most people have never been asked that question.”
Providers on the cutting edge of addiction treatment are increasingly moving toward this approach, with greater emphasis on harm reduction, an evidence-based, albeit controversial, strategy that aims to minimize the damaging effects of drug use rather than fixating on forcing patients to get “clean.” In a society raised on the concept of total abstinence from drugs, that can be a tough sell politically — but the idea is that opioid addiction is a serious illness, and breaking an addiction to opioids is extremely hard (as Ling said, patients can’t simply go back to their old selves). Harm reduction is in part about finding an approach that will actually work for people: reaching those who might not otherwise seek care, empowering them to make their own choices, and helping them work toward incremental changes. 
Harm reduction measures include safe consumption sites (where people use drugs under the supervision of trained medical professionals), syringe exchange programs (where users can obtain clean needles), distribution programs for naloxone (a medication that can reverse an overdose), and fentanyl test strips (which can prevent overdoses by detecting whether someone’s drugs contain fentanyl). “Any positive change — that’s sort of the mantra of harm reduction,” said Sue. 
Cutting-edge treatments don’t mean much if patients can’t access them
A visit last fall with one of Sarah Wakeman’s patients during a checkup in her Boston clinic gave me a glimpse of addiction treatment — and the barriers that work against it. Samuel (who’s being referred to by a pseudonym to protect his privacy) first encountered opioids in high school, when his doctor prescribed them (“pretty heavily,” he said) for a wrestling injury. “I found out that I liked it,” he said, and he became addicted in college, after experimenting with drugs with a roommate. Before long, he wound up on heroin. For several years, his life unraveled: debt, lost jobs, defaulted loans, an arrest, multiple trips to rehab and 12-step programs. 
Samuel found his way to Wakeman’s practice a few years ago. He’s stable now, taking buprenorphine — with a job and an apartment and a new puppy. But he told me he’d encountered judgment and distrust from many of the people he initially looked to for help, even those whose job it is to help him, like doctors and psychiatrists. Even now, pharmacists sometimes hesitate to refill his buprenorphine prescription, leading him to stash extra doses so he doesn’t run out, he said, which can be “dangerous behavior” for someone with an addiction. 
That stigma compounds the hurdles that are already a part of buprenorphine treatment. Although it’s intended to be a long-term therapy, as a controlled substance, it is prescribed in small increments that must be refilled every few days or weeks. If he’d been any less motivated to get better, he told me, he’s not sure he would have made it — or, he added, if he’d been any less privileged: Samuel is an educated white man in his mid-30s who grew up in a family of medical professionals. 
The logistical and ideological obstacles to treatment are, of course, tied to the kinds of people who bear the brunt of the epidemic — those who exist, in one way or another, on the margins of society. Addiction is one of a cluster of interconnected crises unfolding across the country: homelessness, poverty, mental illness, untreated trauma, an epidemic of loneliness. Opioid overdoses spiked in 2020 during the onslaught of Covid-19, in part because people were isolated from each other as well as from treatment. Racism plays a major role in limiting access to treatment, too, as does mass incarceration. There’s a shortage of addiction care providers, particularly in rural America, where the scarcity of basic primary care for all types of patients is increasingly dire. 
Until recently, nearly 60 percent of rural people lived in counties without a single doctor authorized to prescribe buprenorphine. (That changed last year, after a law requiring providers to obtain a special waiver to dispense the medication was eliminated.) In Madison, Wisconsin, where Elizabeth Salisbury-Afshar practices addiction medicine, it’s not unusual for patients to travel one or two hours each way to her clinic “for an appointment that’s maybe 30 minutes long,” she says. “It’s a full-day endeavor. But folks don’t have another choice.” 
In rural areas, Salisbury-Ashfar said, many of the primary care doctors who would be the first line of addiction treatment are too overwhelmed to provide it. “The providers that we have, we’re just trying not to burn them out, because we are short-staffed on every front,” she said. “We would love to have enough primary care docs to be doing this, but primary care docs can’t keep up with primary care.” 
It’s not enough to have a breakthrough treatment like MAT if the people who need it can’t get it — or can’t stay in it. Among the “compounding mistakes and failures” that led to the current crisis is the fact that “our health care system is not set up well to accommodate people who are vulnerable or marginalized,” a group that includes most of those with addiction, said Joudrey, the Pittsburgh addiction doctor. “In the United States, we’ve become so focused on innovation and looking for technological solutions, we can end up neglecting the sociological and economic contributors of the overdose epidemic.”
Joudrey told me about a patient he met years ago in a mobile treatment program. He started her on buprenorphine, which helped her stop using fentanyl, and every year afterward, she would send a thank-you email. “She was just thrilled,” he recalled. But she was also socially isolated and stuck in a dead-end job that didn’t quite pay the bills. This precarity left her at greater risk of falling back into drugs. “The medicine didn’t change her larger social circumstances,” Joudrey said. “As a clinician, as a researcher, it’s sort of grappling with what we can and can’t do, in terms of the limits of health care and medicine.” 
We have low-effort interventions that can make a difference
These experiences hammer home the urgent need to build a different treatment architecture to lower overdose deaths. Research has outlined a number of promising approaches. Some have begun gaining traction already, including harm reduction. Although contentious for many years because many believed it enabled drug use, harm reduction has been gaining mainstream acceptance among providers and policymakers. Decades of research, in the US as well as in countries like Canada and Ukraine, show that it saves both lives and money. 
Despite halting and uneven progress, a nationwide push to bring MAT into jails and prisons — driven in part by ACLU lawsuits in several states — is picking up momentum. The need for this is urgent: Overdose deaths from drugs or alcohol rose by 600 percent in state prisons between 2001 and 2018, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics — which estimated in 2009 (the most recent year with national data) that almost two-thirds of incarcerated people have substance use disorders. A 2015 study in North Carolina found that the risk of overdose was as much as 40 times higher for those recently released from prison than for other state residents.
In 2014, Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where Wakeman practices, opened one of the first “bridge clinics” in the country, intended to bridge the gap between a patient’s discharge from the emergency room (after, say, an overdose) and longer-term addiction treatment — a critical moment, Wakeman told me, when the risk of relapse or overdose is high. Patients can walk into the bridge clinic without an appointment — from the emergency department down the hall, or simply right off the street — and begin buprenorphine treatment that day. They can also receive psychiatric counseling services, recovery coaching, and nursing care, and the clinic keeps harm reduction supplies for patients still using. If they want to, Wakeman said, people can just have a cup of coffee and “hang out here if they need a place to be okay.” 
Bridge clinics have been opening up at other sites, too, including dozens in California alone, and early evidence shows they’ve led to promising rates of MAT treatment and linked patients to longer-term addiction care. Those effects can ripple through other parts of the hospital. One study by researchers in Syracuse, New York, found that emergency department visits dropped by 42 percent in the six months after a bridge clinic opened. Research also indicates that bridge clinics help fill a void in care for patients with “clinically complex” cases: patients with concurrent addictions to other substances, serious mental illness, homelessness, and infections like HIV or hepatitis. 
Where primary care doctors are stretched thin, nurses could fill gaps in access to care. Since 2016, federal regulations have allowed nurse practitioners and physician assistants (PAs) to prescribe buprenorphine, but laws in some states, including those hit hard by the overdose crisis, still block them from providing that care. Tennessee explicitly forbids nurses and PAs from prescribing buprenorphine. “So you can’t do everything you’re educated and certified to do,” said Matthew Tierney, a psychiatric nurse practitioner and clinical professor at the University of California San Francisco, who serves as medical director for inpatient substance use management for UCSF Health. Advanced practice nurses, he said, especially those in mental health, “have the education and training to really treat substance related disorders.” When federal rules opened up prescribing to nurses and PAs, they began applying for licenses in higher numbers than physicians. 
Bringing methadone care into normal medical settings, like in other countries, would be a huge step in opening up access. Early in the Covid pandemic, many methadone clinics relaxed their rules, allowing more take-home doses and letting family members pick up medications for patients in quarantine — offering a glimpse of what lasting change might look like. 
A bill before Congress, the Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access Act (MOTA), would effectively make that permanent, authorizing addiction medicine physicians and psychiatrists to prescribe methadone. Studies indicate that patients are no more likely to overdose or abuse the medication when they’re able to take home a longer supply. In fact, it seems to help survival rates. 
Among addiction specialists, opinions about MOTA are, admittedly, not uniform — some worry the bill goes too far and would put patients at risk of methadone overdose, while others think it doesn’t go far enough in expanding access. Rachel Simon, a doctor who practices at the methadone clinic in New York’s Bellevue Hospital, sees MOTA as “a crucial first step” to lowering treatment barriers. “Methadone is a beautiful medicine,” she told me. “The time to make changes was yesterday.” 
What if we remove treatment from sterile medical settings?
For some patients, it might help to disentangle addiction care from formal medical settings. Context matters, and making treatment more culturally authentic can succeed where other approaches fail. The Connecticut-based Imani Breakthrough Project, launched in 2017, brings addiction care into Black and Latinx churches as a way to address racial disparities in treatment. Developed by Yale addiction psychiatrists Ayana Jordan and Chyrell Bellamy, the program (“Imani” means “faith” in Swahili) consists of weekly mutual support and recovery education classes alongside individualized coaching and cognitive behavioral therapy, all held in churches. 
“This project was really born out of a dire need,” Jordan told me — at a time when Black and Hispanic overdose deaths were climbing, but the media was primarily focused on the epidemic’s white, rural victims. 
While they were developing the program, Jordan said, “overwhelmingly, what we found is that people didn’t want to come into traditional care. They didn’t feel safe.” (Black Americans in particular often distrust the medical establishment — with good historical reason.) And for many patients, spirituality was important to recovery, Jordan told me, so the church itself represented a form of intervention: a sacred and familiar space where people in the community felt known. 
Originally located in eight churches across Connecticut, the program recently expanded into Rhode Island and New Orleans, with plans to open in Boston and New York City. In 2021, Jordan and her team launched a new version of the Imani program as a five-year NIH-funded project, in which participants can consult with Black or Latinx psychiatrists via telehealth to start MAT in their church. The eventual goal, she told me, is to implement the Imani model nationwide. 
According to a study of Imani’s first three years, a striking 42 percent of participants remained in the program after 12 weeks. (There isn’t a perfect comparison to treatment in a standard medical setting, but a 2016 analysis of addiction treatment data found that 20 percent of Black patients and 15 percent of Latinx patients completed their programs, compared to 60 percent of white patients.) Participants also improved their scores on tests measuring wellness and community citizenship. “And we had great outcomes in terms of stopping substance use altogether, or decreasing their substance use,” Jordan told me. 
Recalling the early sessions, Jordan said, “We were seeing for the first time an environment that is really clear about the sovereignty of being Black or Latinx.” In a country where the dual identity of being a person of color with addiction means that “you’re totally thrown away,” she said, having a place where “church members alongside people who look like you, welcome you, and also integrate medical practices into the group is extremely powerful.”",,Vox,High-Quality News Sources,We have treatments for opioid addiction that work.

Chris Serres,Dramatic shift in drug using habits poses challenges for combating overdose crisis,"Smoking drugs has overtaken injecting them as the primary cause of fatal overdoses, a new study says.",https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/02/15/metro/drugs-overdoses-injection-smoking-study/,https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/PliiRRfh85Sa2K8ayKr3m_sk63Y=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/5KAWPV5AO5LEWW3KGDOMOBWRYU.jpg,2024-02-15T18:49:08Z,"The study by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) poses questions about whether enough is being done statewide to minimize the deadly risks associated with the increasing number of people who smoke opioids, instead of injecting them with needles.
This study is a signal that more people are shifting their [drug-using] habits, and strategies need to shift, said Dr. Miriam Harriscq, an assistant professor of medicine at the Boston University School of Medicinecq and an addiction expert at Boston Medical Centercq. Inhalation spaces are absolutely critical.
In Massachusetts, injecting drugs is still the most common pathway to overdose deaths, but smoking-related overdoses are rising at a much faster rate. The percentage of overdose deaths with evidence of smoking more than quadrupled to 16.9 percent in 2022, up from 3.9 percent in 2020, according to CDC data. Those with evidence of injecting drugs rose from 12.1 percent to 19.7 percent over the same time, according to CDC data.
A growing number of public health advocates and local officials have embraced the concept of supervised consumption sites, also known as safe injection sites, where people can inject illicit drugs under the watchful eye of trained professionals. Any designs for such sites will have to include so-called inhalation spaces or other accommodations for people who smoke drugs, and not just inhale them, say advocates for the sites.
Because of legal barriers, there are only two supervised drug consumption sites in the country, both in New York City, though another is scheduled to open early this year in Providence.
CDC researchers found that the leading route of drug overdose deaths changed drastically over the past two years. The number of overdose fatalities with evidence of smoking soared 109 percent, with smoking the route for 23 percent of these deaths, beween January 2020 to December 2022. In contrast, the number of fatal overdoses with evidence that drugs had been injected has declined sharply, and accounted for 16 percent of overdose deaths over the same period. This shift was consistent across all regions of the country, the CDC found.
The sharp increase in the number of overdose deaths stemming from smoking could be driven, in part, by a rapidly growing practice known as polysubstance use, in which potent synthetic opioids are mixed with stimulants such as cocaine and counterfeit pain pills that are often smoked. Also, the shift could reflect a broader change in drug-using habits: People may be motivated to smoke drugs, rather than use needles, because smoking carries a lower risk of bloodborne and other infectious diseases, say addiction specialists.
Yet inhaling illicit substances can intensify the effects of the drugs and increase the overdose risk, the CDC said in its study. Nearly 80 percent of overdose deaths with evidence of smoking had no evidence of injection. And persons who use drugs by smoking might not take advantage of traditional syringe service programs where harm-reduction supplies are available, according to the CDC report.
Although unsafe injection drug use practices might be most risky in terms of infectious disease transmission, other routes, particularly smoking, still carry substantial overdose risk, the CDC study said.
In 2022, overdose fatalities in Massachusetts reached 2,359 the highest on record and more than triple the number from a decade ago. The rise in overdose deaths has been propelled by the proliferation of the cheap and highly potent opioid fentanyl, which is deadly even in tiny amounts, and the mixing of opioids with stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine.
Allyson Pinkhover director of substance use services at Brockton Neighborhood Health Center, said the findings reinforce the importance of including so-called safer smoking supplies in harm-reduction outreach efforts. Supplies such as clean pipes, rubberized mouthpieces, and alcohol swabs, can reduce the transmission of diseases, including hepatitis c.
There is still a lack of understanding of the risks associated with smoking illicit drugs, Pinkhover said. There is strong evidence that providing safer smoking supplies helps [users] stay engaged in care, and prevents some of the negative health impacts associated with smoking.

Chris Serres,Boston outlines plans to spend millions in opioid settlement money,The plan includes a new fund for families who have lost loved ones to the overdose crisis.,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/01/26/metro/overdose-opioid-fentanyl-boston-lawsuit-settlement/,https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/LLPPnbu1wuQU-eCGzIkdCSn7a0A=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/PUGRJLCR7EZPL72BIEPBZ6UJQY.jpg,2024-01-26T23:22:29Z,"The first wave of funding from multibillion dollar settlements with the opioid industry will go toward expanding treatment programs, increasing the availability of supportive housing for people with substance use disorders, reversing racial disparities in overdose deaths and providing relief for families devastated by the unrelenting opioid epidemic, according to a plan unveiled Friday by Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and the Boston Public Health Commission.
The new strategies include the creation of a Family Overdose Support Fund, which will provide financial support to Boston families who have lost a loved one to an opioid overdose. The fund will launch later this year with $250,000 to cover child care, funeral expenses, legal services, and other financial burdens faced by those with firsthand experience with the deadly scourge.
The grief and trauma of losing a loved one to overdose has a lasting impact on our communities, Wu said in a written statement. This fund will help support our families and our communities by easing the financial burdens that undermine a healthy grieving process.
The announcement culminates months of planning and deliberation by the Boston Public Health Commission, and comes as local and state governments nationwide struggle to reverse year after year of rising overdose fatalities. So far, Boston has collected $6 million through legal settlements from opioid manufacturers and distributors the most of any municipality in the state. Yet like many cities and towns across Massachusetts, Boston has not spent any of the money as it has grappled with how to address the public health disaster.
Apart from the new fund, the city did not lay out specific spending amounts for the other proposed investments.
Boston, which ultimately expects to receive $22 million through 2038 from the legal settlements, has taken a deliberative approach to deploying the settlement funds, first seeking input directly from Boston residents and those directly affected by the overdose crisis. Since last summer, the commission has collected more than 400 submissions from an online survey and held eight listening sessions around Boston with more than 200 participants. A majority of respondents wanted to prioritize the needs of grieving families by providing direct financial support, the health commission said.
There is an overwhelming need to hold these drug manufacturers accountable, said Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, the executive director of the Boston Public Health Commission. And I think that, if allocated appropriately, these funds could help right tragic wrongs, they could save lives, and ... mitigate some of those ongoing harms.
Massachusetts expects to receive almost $1 billion over 18 years from settlements with opioid manufacturers and distributors sued for their roles in the nations staggering toll of overdoses, which remain near record highs and claimed more than 2,300 lives in Massachusetts in 2022.
Forty percent of the money is being distributed among municipalities, with the dollar amount based on such factors as the number of opioid-related deaths and the amount of opioids flowing into that community, calculated by population. The remaining 60 percent is being deposited into the statewide Opioid Recovery and Remediation Fund, overseen by the state Executive Office of Health and Human Services.
Under an agreement, cities and towns that receive the settlement money must spend it on substance abuse prevention, treatment, recovery programs, support for pregnant women with opioid use disorder, as well as harm-reduction strategies that seek to reduce a drug users risk of getting sick or dying, among other strategies.
Massachusetts is slated to receive another $90 million under a separate 2021 settlement deal with Purdue Pharma, producer of OxyContin; but that deal has been held up as the US Supreme Court weighs whether the companys former owners, the wealthy Sackler family, can be shielded from civil lawsuits under the terms of its bankruptcy deal.
In 2022, 352 people died from opioid overdoses in Boston, up nearly 7 percent from the previous year and more than quadruple the number from a decade ago. From 2019 to 2022, Boston experienced a 36 percent increase in opioid related deaths, more than twice the statewide rate of increase (16 percent) over the same time period. The crisis is disproportionately affecting Black and Hispanic people: Overdose fatalities among Black residents of Boston soared by 29 percent last year, according to state data.
The increase in overdose deaths has been propelled by the increasingly toxic illicit drug supply, the proliferation of the cheap and highly potent opioid fentanyl, which is deadly even in tiny amounts, and the mixing of opioids with stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine.
One of the reasons that it took us a long time ... to do this community engagement process is that we wanted to make sure that we were inclusive of communities that have been disproportionately impacted and sometimes left out, Ojikutu said. All of these things have made it so incredibly important that we also acknowledge their desires and needs.

Chris Serres,‘Tranq’ and other drugs causing harder-to-revive overdoses across Mass.,Polysubstance use is jeopardizing life-saving efforts for drug overdose victims.,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/02/24/metro/polysubstance-drug-overdose-massachusetts/,https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/Lnhr1ZVFmNi33S0xNtORlLpobCw=/506x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/bostonglobe/TX4FLUSZNRECI3QGFLTAYAQRQE.jpg,2024-02-24T11:00:02Z,"A new and more powerful wave of overdoses is spreading rapidly across Massachusetts, and its putting severe pressure on front-line medical workers trying to save lives. In some cases, overdose victims are so heavily sedated on a toxic mix of substances that they can remain in a blackout stupor for hours. In other cases, victims overdose so quickly that theres not enough time to revive them.
These new and complex cases are confounding health agencies and leading front-line workers to rethink how they respond to overdoses. First responders are learning that even multiple sprays of naloxone, a drug effective at reversing most opioidoverdoses, are not enough to revive someone and can do more harm than good. So, outreach workers are deploying multiple tools and techniques, including pulse oximeters to check oxygen levels in the field, plastic mouth guards for mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, and test strips to help people identify the drugs they are taking before they use them.
Xylazine, a powerful animal tranquilizer used by veterinarians, is the chief culprit behind the prolonged overdoses.Known by the street names tranq or tranq dope, xylazine is not an opioid, which means that its effects cannot be reversed with naloxone, a medication also known by the brand name Narcan,that targets the brains opioid receptors. In the first quarter of this year, xylazine was detected in an alarming 49 percent of the states illicit drug supply, double the percentage from the same period last year, according to samples tested through Brandeis Universitys drug-checking program.
Doctors and first responders say its particularly challenging to rouse a person sedated with xylazine. Some victims pass out and do not move for several hours, which can be especially dangerous if they are alone or outside in the extreme cold, say street outreach workers. It also renders users especially vulnerable to rape and robbery. In addition to causing breathing and heart rates to drop, xylazine injections havebeen linked to severe skin wounds. The sedative is increasingly being mixed into street drugs such as fentanyl and heroin that can be injected, snorted, or inhaled.
People are so heavily sedated [from xylazine] that theyre not responding in ways you would expect from an overdose, said Jessie Gaeta, a physician and former medical director at the nonprofit Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program.
The hard-to-reverse overdoses also reflect a broader shift in drug-using habits among those struggling with addiction, say health researchers. More people are mixing opioids with stimulants like cocaine and antianxiety medications such as benzodiazepines (known as benzos), a practice known as polysubstance use. In many cases, people are taking multiple drugs to counteract their different side effects, or to prolong the experience, say addiction treatment specialists.
Many of these drugs are now laced with fentanyl, a fast-acting andhighly potent synthetic opioid that is lethal even in tiny amounts. Fentanyl has become a leading cause of death in the United States and has been driving the relentless death toll from overdoses across New England. In 2022, overdose fatalities in Massachusetts reached 2,359 the highest on record.While highly effective, naloxone is sometimes not enough to contend with the speed at which people overdose on fentanyl, which moves through the system much faster than other opioids. With fentanyl, breathing can stop within several minutes, compared with up to an hour with heroin, researchers have found.
We used to have minutes to an hour to respond to overdoses, said Traci Green, an epidemiologist and director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative at Brandeis University. Now we have seconds to minutes.
Derrick Cormier, 50, a recovering addict and former warehouse worker from Worcester, recalled nearly dying from xylazine-laced heroin last summer. He injected a small amount of the mixture in a park and then passed out for several hours, before waking drenched in sweat and shaking with abdominal pain. Days later, he developed black-and-purple flesh wounds on his arms a sign that he had injected tranq dope.
Tranq is everywhere, and its pure poison, said Cormier, who said the incident led him to seek counseling for his drug use. The stuff thats out there ... just a little bit can knock you out for hours.
In many cases, simply spraying Narcan, the over-the-counter nasal spray that contains naloxone,into a victims nose and calling 911 is no longer enough.
First responders are now stressing the importance of ensuring that a person who has overdosed has adequate oxygen, to reduce the risk they will die or suffer brain damage. They recommend making sure the persons airway is clear and providing mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, also known as rescue breathing, after administering Narcan and while waiting for rescue crews to arrive.
Harm reduction groups are also distributing more plastic mouth guards for mouth-to-mouth resuscitation as well as drug-testing supplies, including paper strips that can be dipped into drugs to detect if they contain fentanyl or xylazine. People who discover fentanyl using the strips are more likely to take steps to reduce the risks of a deadly overdose, such as slowing their intake or using with someone else present, studies have found.
Having an unregulated drug supply presents us with a constant challenge, said Eliza Wheeler, co-director of Remedy Alliance/For the People, a national network of harm-reduction programs based in Berkeley, Calif., that distributes naloxone. We are learning as we go as harm reductionists sometimes blindly.
For a time, it was widely believed that giving multiple doses of naloxone was necessary if someone didnt immediately start breathing again after an overdose. But too much of the overdose-reversal drug can send someone into severe withdrawal, and possibly reduce their willingness to carry the life-saving drug, say harm-reduction specialists and health researchers.
A study released this month by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that a higher-dose nasal spray for reversing opioid overdoses did not save more lives than the previous standard dose, but it did cause more withdrawal symptoms, including vomiting and disorientation.
In the past, people had this mentality that the only goal in these situations was to reverse the overdose, said Allyson Pinkhover, director of substance use services atBrockton Neighborhood Health Center. But there is actually a two-fold goal: You have to reverse the overdose, but you have to do it in a way that doesnt cause unnecessary pain and suffering.
As director of the states overdose prevention hot line, Stephen Murray has a rare, inside look at evolving drug use patterns.
The frequent mixing of drugs poses challenges for operators of the state helpline, which has trained staff tomonitor people by telephone while they use drugs. Even if someone says they are using a stimulant such as cocaine, Murray noted, operators track the persons speech pattern to detect if the drug is laced with a potentially lethal opioid. Someone who suddenly becomes drowsy or less talkative on the helpline could have taken cocaine laced with fentanyl, he noted.
In the past, treatment professionals often would ask people seeking help for addictions to identify their so-called drug of choice, so they could tailor therapies based on the symptoms. Now, that question has become less relevant, he said, because people are routinely using several different types of drugs. Very rarely is substance use just about using one substance, Murray said.
Outreach workers at the Brockton Neighborhood Health Centers mobile unit have kept expanding the number of tools they carry in response to growing intensity of the overdoses they encounter. They are now equipped with pulse oximeters to track victims blood-oxygen levels, CPR face shields, and naloxone. People can also bring samples of their drugs to the mobile unit to have them checked for fentanyl and other toxic substances.
On a frigid weekday morning, the medical trailer pulled into a parking lot behind the Universal Missionary Church in Brockton. Within minutes, a line of people a couple of themclutching drug samples to be checked formed outside the vans window. Each interaction was a fresh opportunity for outreach workers to hand out harm-reduction supplies and to educate visitors about the increasingly contaminated drug supply. Often, visitors pass along the information they glean from the drug tests to their peers so they know what to avoid, she noted.
Knowledge is power, Pinkhover said. The same people we are trying to save are the ones who are saving others.

Lev Facher,How the US is sabotaging its best tools to prevent deaths in the opioid epidemic,A yearlong STAT investigation shows that virtually every sector of American society is obstructing the use of medications that could prevent tens of thousands of overdose deaths.,https://www.statnews.com/2024/03/05/opioid-addiction-treatment-methadone-buprenorphine-restrictions/,https://www.statnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/WOR_P1MetaImage-1024x576.jpg,2024-03-05T13:41:11Z,"You're reading Part 1 of The War on Recovery, a yearlong investigation into how the U.S. denies lifesaving medications to people with opioid addiction.
Part 2 coming March 12
The opioid overdose epidemic has burned through the U.S. for nearly 30 years. Yet for all that time, the country has had tools that are highly effective at preventing overdose deaths: methadone and buprenorphine.
These medicines are cheap and easy to distribute. People who take them use illicit drugs at far lower rates, and are at far lower risk of overdose or death. By beating back the cravings and agonizing withdrawal symptoms that result from trying to quit opioids cold turkey, methadone and buprenorphine can help people addicted to opioids escape an existence defined by drugs and achieve stable, healthy lives. 
But a yearlong investigation by STAT shows that virtually every sector of American society is obstructing the use of medications that could prevent tens of thousands of deaths each year. Increasingly, public health experts and even government officials cast the countrys singular failure to prevent overdose deaths not as an unavoidable tragedy but as a conscious choice.
Narcotics Anonymous, a nationwide organization that promotes the 12-step model of addiction recovery, actively opposes the use of medication, leading would-be participants like Mark Palinski, 38, to be banned from chapter meetings in North Carolina after disclosing that he had been prescribed buprenorphine. Hundreds of jails and prisons bar their use even when prescribed by a doctor, forcing people like Amanda Cassidy-Trejo, 41, to suffer weeks of agonizing withdrawal in a San Antonio jail cell. Even specialized methadone clinics, which otherwise support the use of medications, can make them all but impossible to access, requiring patients like Rebecca Smith, 65, to show up daily at her Detroit clinic to swallow a single dose a rule that forced her to quit her job.
Few doctors prescribe buprenorphine (commonly known by the brand name Suboxone). Roughly 40% of Walmart, Rite Aid, and CVS pharmacy locations decline to stock it. Many rehab facilities and sober living houses refuse to admit people taking either medication. Federal regulations often prevent truck drivers and pilots from taking methadone or buprenorphine. In many cases, state medical boards even prevent doctors and nurses in recovery from taking the same medications theyd provide to patients seeking treatment for opioid addiction. 
Though overdose death rates have climbed steadily for the past two decades, researchers estimate that barely one-fifth of the approximately 2.5 million Americans with opioid use disorder receive medication and tens of thousands have died for lack of it.
More than 80,000 people are dying of opioid overdose every year, and yet we have a tool, medication-assisted treatment, that we know dramatically reduces overdose deaths, said David Frank, a medical sociologist at New York University who takes methadone for opioid addiction. But because its so difficult to access, people that could and should be alive continue to die.
STATs examination of the overdose epidemic is based on hundreds of interviews with patients, doctors, policy experts, lawmakers, scientists, and other major figures in drug policy and addiction medicine. It relies on an exhaustive review of legal documents, tax filings, financial disclosures, patient records, lobbying reports, and peer-reviewed academic research. And it includes a first-of-its-kind analysis of the ownership and practices of Americas roughly 2,000 methadone clinics, detailing for the first time how private equity firms have acquired a major stake in the nations addiction-treatment infrastructure while opposing calls for reform.
Methadone and buprenorphine have one major drawback: They are themselves opioids, a fact that opponents have used to cast the medications as no better than illicit drugs sold on a street corner. Indeed, they are not perfect: Methadone, which is sometimes used to treat pain, can cause sedation or even overdose if used improperly. Buprenorphine, while far safer, can also cause complications when used in combination with alcohol or other drugs. Amid a broad push to increase access to addiction medications, some experts have argued for proceeding with caution.
We need to continue to improve access, but we need to do it in a way that maintains quality and safety, said Kenneth Stoller, an addiction psychiatrist and researcher at Johns Hopkins University. If were expanding access by just flooding the streets with a medication that we know is easily misused, and when misused is dangerous, thats a problem as well.
But both medications are far less potent than the illicit substances whose use they are meant to prevent, like heroin or fentanyl. And they are the gold standard for addiction treatment. 
People genuinely have no idea how effective these medications are at preventing people from dying.
Ayana Jordan, NYU Langone Health
In an interview, Nora Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, estimated that if methadone and buprenorphine were made universally available nationwide, opioid overdoses would fall by half, if not more. 
We have these very effective medications, and the question is why are they not being implemented, she said. I estimate that we would have at least 50% less people dying, and thats conservative. I think it would probably be much more consequential.
Yet instead of providing people with pharmaceuticals known to treat their condition, in the United States, common approaches to treating opioid addiction still include undergoing painful and ineffective detox; 12-step approaches like Narcotics Anonymous; or even equine therapy, a form of treatment that centers on spending time with horses. 
While such programs often rely heavily on hope, mindfulness, and religion, they often ignore the physiological realities of addiction in particular, the debilitating withdrawal that occurs when regular opioid users attempt to suddenly stop. In any other medical field, favoring prayer over proven medication would be considered malpractice. Yet for addiction treatment in the U.S., its simply the way things work.
There is a core belief, thats different from other countries, that people with opioid addiction dont deserve care in the way that somebody who has cancer or diabetes does, said Ayana Jordan, a researcher and addiction psychiatrist at NYU Langone Health. People genuinely have no idea how effective these medications are at preventing people from dying.
Not changing one drug for another
The evidence supporting the use of methadone and buprenorphine is overwhelming. According to NIDA, patients using methadone and buprenorphine are 59% and 38% less likely, respectively, to die of an opioid overdose compared to those not receiving medication. Other data show an even greater effect: One recent study demonstrated an overall 80% drop in opioid overdose deaths among people taking either medication. A separate study showed that incarcerated people taking methadone or buprenorphine were 80% less likely to die of overdose in the first month after being released. The World Health Organization lists both medications on its model list of essential medicines, citing a strong evidence base for their use.
The medications have remarkable secondary effects, too. People being treated with methadone or buprenorphine are vastly less likely to be diagnosed with HIV, hepatitis C, endocarditis, and other diseases that can be transmitted via drug injection. Both medications are also associated with a marked decrease in depression symptoms.
While methadone and buprenorphine are opioids, they bear little resemblance to the substances that cause the vast majority of opioid overdoses namely heroin and fentanyl. Methadone is extremely slow-acting, making it a poor option for people seeking opioids euphoric effects. Buprenorphine is known as a partial agonist, meaning it only partly binds to the receptor that provides a high when stimulated by other opioids. Practically speaking, buprenorphine only has one true use: treating opioid addiction.
A third medication, Vivitrol, has been embraced as a treatment for opioid addiction by many judges, prisons, and some doctors specifically because, though it reduces opioid cravings, it is not an opioid. A recent analysis shows that people who take Vivitrol which costs as much as $2,100 per monthly dose may in fact overdose at higher rates than people taking buprenorphine.
Despite the medications remarkable effectiveness, the countrys view of buprenorphine and methadone is built largely on myths and stigma. In 2017, Tom Price, then health secretary to President Trump, referred to what is called medication-assisted treatment as just substituting one opioid for another. Law enforcement agencies like the Drug Enforcement Administration, while widely criticized for allowing the proliferation of OxyContin and other painkillers that fueled the opioid epidemic in the 1990s and 2000s, now forcefully regulate buprenorphine and methadone, even as illicit fentanyl floods the market.
They are not changing one drug for another, said Volkow, who has led the federal governments $1.6 billion addiction research institute since 2003. Theyre not different from other medications you may need to take, like antihypertensive medications or antidiabetic medications. They allow for your physiology to be normalized, which is necessary to achieve recovery.

Still, in much of the U.S., the prevailing attitude remains that achieving sobriety by using medications does not constitute true recovery. Even medication-assisted treatment, long a common term in the field, betrays an embedded stigma: That the medication itself is not a treatment, but a supplement. Many addiction doctors now prefer a new term: medications for opioid use disorder.
In many peoples minds, the only route to beating opioid addiction is to simply stop using, experience days or weeks of agonizing withdrawal, and never use opioids again even if those opioids are highly regulated medications prescribed for the purpose of treating addiction. Doctors, however, say the approach fails for nearly everyone who tries it, especially in the age of highly potent illicit fentanyl.
The people that come to me to seek treatment with medication have basically all tried to stop using without medication, said Zoe Weinstein, a doctor who serves as the director of Boston Medical Centers addiction consult service and medical director of a methadone clinic. There are a lot of people who need medication, and many more people who want medication than are able to access it.
Andi Hüttenmoser, a peer support specialist at Arud Centre for Addiction Medicine, picks up his prescription at the clinics location in Zurich, Switzerland, in August 2023.

Thats how nuts this is
The U.S. laws and practices governing addiction medicine are not just out of step with the latest science they are also out of step with laws in most of the Western world.
At Arud, a substance use clinic in Zurich, Switzerland, patients receiving addiction medications are free to come and go as they please. They pick up weeks worth of methadone, and other powerful addiction drugs, at a pharmacy, and are not forced to undergo drug testing or regular counseling sessions as a condition of receiving their medication. While American law enforcement officials and methadone industry representatives have warned that easier access could increase methadone misuse and even overdose, Switzerlands results have been the opposite. There, and throughout Western and Central Europe, countries that have increased addiction medications availability have consistently seen overdose deaths and infectious disease transmission plummet to rates vastly lower than in the United States.
We have a precedent in France, said Volkow, the NIDA director. What the French did was basically provide buprenorphine to every single person that needed it. And you see this dramatic reduction in overdoses they basically stopped.
For decades, American physicians needed to obtain a special license known as the X-waiver just to prescribe buprenorphine. As of 2021, just 75,000 of the nations roughly 1.1 million physicians had obtained the waiver. The Biden administration effectively eliminated that requirement in early 2021, but according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the overall buprenorphine prescribing rate nonetheless decreased from 2021 to 2022.
Methadone, which is widely accessible across Europe, is available in the U.S. only at specialized clinics known as opioid treatment programs, or OTPs. These clinics typically require patients to report in person each day to receive a single dose, forcing them to structure their lives around the clinics dosing schedule.
This is practically the only medication in the entire country that is treated this way, said Rep. Don Norcross (D-N.J.), who has co-authored legislation that would allow specialized addiction doctors to prescribe methadone directly to patients. The medication for abortion that is easier accessed than methadone. Thats how nuts this is. The idea that the only way to do this is to go to the methadone clinic is just insane.
The medication for abortion that is easier accessed than methadone. Thats how nuts this is. The idea that the only way to do this is to go to the methadone clinic is just insane.
Rep. Don Norcross (D-N.J.)
The difficulty of accessing addiction medications, and the stigma that many Americans still attach to them, have deadly consequences. Studies consistently show that patients who do not take medication return to illegal drugs, overdose, or die at far higher rates than patients who do. Research also shows that as many as 90% of patients who participate in abstinence-based addiction treatment that bans the use of methadone or buprenorphine return to use within one year of being discharged. Treatment that relies on quitting opioids cold turkey, studies show, is significantly more dangerous than not receiving treatment at all.
Systemically denying Americans access to addiction medications has also exacerbated racial health disparities. The first decades of the opioid crisis claimed far more white lives than Black lives. But as of 2022, the trend has flipped: Black people now die of opioid overdoses at higher rates in part because Black people seeking treatment for opioid use disorder are far less likely than white people to be prescribed an addiction medication.
The cost of these outdated and scientifically inaccurate attitudes is immense. The opioid crisis has shortened the national life expectancy by more than half a year, weakened U.S. economic output by $1.5 trillion in 2020 alone, and ruined the lives of countless others who are addicted to heroin or fentanyl but havent died of an overdose.
But these medications are not a silver bullet: Even if methadone and buprenorphine were universally accessible, the opioid crisis wouldnt instantly end. Studies show that most Americans with opioid use disorder are not actively seeking treatment.
The system creates barriers to care
Paradoxically, it is often those who claim to be most sympathetic to the cause of addiction treatment who are among the biggest opponents of expanded access to methadone and buprenorphine.
The recovery group Narcotics Anonymous perhaps the countrys largest provider of addiction treatment has taken a hard line against addiction medication. The organizations own literature acknowledges that people taking methadone or buprenorphine are often banned from speaking at meetings, but offers a concession: NA may be compatible for addicts on medically assisted protocols if they have a desire to become clean one day.
In other words: In the view of Narcotics Anonymous, even people who have relied on methadone or buprenorphine to achieve stable recovery are not considered clean. Instead, their full participation in the program would require a pledge to stop taking medications they were prescribed by a doctor, and that first helped them quit illicit drugs.
Narcotics Anonymous did not respond to STATs requests for comment.
Methadone clinics have also opposed calls to expanded access to medication treatment. The American Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence, a trade group representing methadone clinics, has lobbied not just against the deregulation of methadone treatment, but also against a bill that passed in 2022 with overwhelming bipartisan support that made it easier for doctors to prescribe buprenorphine. And in recent decades, methadone treatment has become big business: A majority of methadone clinics now operate as for-profits, and nearly one-third are owned by private equity firms. As calls for reform have grown far louder in recent years, the methadone industry has guarded its monopoly fiercely, and remains staunchly opposed to allowing other doctors to prescribe the medication to patients in need.
Separately, according to federal survey data, at least 751 substance use treatment facilities offer treatment for opioid addiction but reject clients using methadone and buprenorphine. More than 2,000 addiction treatment facilities did not respond to the federal survey, meaning the true number of facilities banning medication is probably significantly higher.
Many medical schools still dont require any training in addiction medicine, or prescribing addiction medications. Many hospitals still do not offer patients buprenorphine or methadone, even in the immediate aftermath of an overdose. Many pharmacies choose not to stock buprenorphine. And insurers, in an effort to pad profit margins, sometimes refuse to pay for newly developed injectable buprenorphine formulations, which last weeks or months and are shown to help patients remain in treatment but cost far more than cheaper versions that must be taken daily.
The American criminal justice system also remains skeptical of medication as treatment. The Drug Enforcement Administration has long displayed hostility to buprenorphine and methadone, and many jails and prisons refuse altogether to provide incarcerated people with either medication. Many judges with no medical training even in drug court systems supposedly meant to aid addiction recovery have historically barred people arrested for low-grade drug offenses from taking any opioid, including addiction medications.
As workers, people taking addiction medications face immense discrimination. Many employers, labor unions, and professional societies ban their members from taking addiction medications in any circumstance.
There are a lot of ways that the system creates barriers to care, said Weinstein, the Boston addiction doctor. We start to believe that if the system is created that way, it must be necessary, there must be a good reason. But that may not be true: The reason may be outdated, or never existed, or was based on stigma.

It doesnt get you high
The addiction crisis is among the largest public health emergencies in U.S. history. But the American people and government have treated it with a remarkable lack of urgency.
Recent events provide a stark comparison. In early 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic led the U.S. to launch an unprecedented effort to develop a vaccine. The government told drug companies, in essence, that it would pay them whatever they wanted. Most doctors made clear that they would provide any eventual vaccines to anybody who wanted them.
The U.S. opioid crisis is precisely the opposite. More than 1 million Americans have died of drug overdoses since 2000, and opioid death rates have steadily increased for the past two decades. But there is no Operation Warp Speed for addiction. There has been no rush to develop miraculous new drugs that can sharply reduce deaths from a devastating health crisis in part because the government and pharmaceutical industry have displayed minimal interest in the crisis, and in part because these medications already exist.
The publics broad opposition to addiction medications stands in stark contrast to its general acceptance of other common strategies used to improve health. Broadly speaking, Americans do not oppose drinking Diet Coke instead of Coke, cooking with olive oil instead of butter, or chewing nicotine gum instead of smoking cigarettes. But when it comes to using relatively weak, highly regulated, pharmaceutical-grade opioids to help quit deadly synthetic drugs like fentanyl, much of society remains staunchly opposed.
The entertainment industry, in particular, has often served as a cheerleader for misleading tropes and treatment approaches that oppose medication. The recent hit show Euphoria, for instance, depicts a teen who develops an opioid addiction but is only offered treatment based on the 12-step model offered by Narcotics Anonymous not with medication. A decade ago, House, an award-winning medical drama about the star doctor at an elite teaching hospital, gave its protagonist two choices: use copious amounts of Vicodin or grit out a week of brutal and dangerous withdrawal. Four Good Days, a Mila Kunis movie released in 2020, is based on a nearly identical premise.
The few mainstream voices who have sought to increase acceptance for medications have failed often in tragic fashion. Kurt Cobain, among the most influential musicians of his generation, wrote in a 1993 journal entry that he had found success treating his opioid withdrawal symptoms thanks to buprenorphine.
The best thing about it is that there are no known side effects, he wrote. It acts as an opiate but it doesnt get you high.
The doctor who prescribed buprenorphine to Cobain died in 1993, however, cutting him off from a medication that, at the time, was only legally available as a pain treatment. Unable to find another doctor willing to provide it, he returned to heroin use. He died by suicide in 1994.
We need everybody to step up
Attitudes toward medication for opioid use disorder are finally beginning to shift. The 2022 repeal of the X-waiver requirement for doctors came after years of lobbying from public health groups seeking wider access to buprenorphine.
Increasingly, researchers and members of Congress have called for ending methadone clinics monopoly and allowing physicians to prescribe the medication directly to patients. In 2021, the Urban Survivors Union, an activist group focused on harm reduction and the safety of people who use drugs, published the Methadone Manifesto, a sweeping call for change highlighting the human costs of the current methadone-distribution system.
And for the first time, the White House has pledged to make medication access a priority: President Biden said in the 2022 State of the Union address that his administration plans to make addiction medications universally accessible by 2025.
But there is no chance the country will meet his goal.
To do so, far more doctors would need to prescribe buprenorphine. Hospitals, pharmacies, and insurers would need to radically shift their policy and practice to encourage the use of addiction medications and provide a less hostile treatment environment for people with addiction. Congress and local lawmakers would need to pass laws mandating access to medication treatment. Branches of government including prisons, courts, and law enforcement would need to overhaul their own rules regarding access to treatment for the hundreds of thousands of people with addiction charged with, or serving time for, drug-related crimes.
Key components of the countrys existing addiction treatment infrastructure, from Narcotics Anonymous to rehab facilities, would need to adopt a different tone regarding the benefits of methadone or buprenorphine. Many methadone clinics, as well, would need to take a more welcoming, less punitive tack toward patients who come to seek treatment.
Absent those changes, American societys deeply embedded bias against addiction medications make it all but certain that the status quo will remain or at least, that the U.S. wont change course before losing hundreds of thousands more of its citizens.
Outdated views, combined with stigma around treatments for opioid use disorder, combined with the challenging regulatory environment, are leading to a situation where people just arent getting evidence-based care, said Jesse Ehrenfeld, an anesthesiologist and president of the American Medical Association. This is a moment where we need everybody to step up, and stop dragging their feet.

For the last year, Lev Facher has been investigating a disturbing pattern hed noticed as STATs addiction reporter: Even with overdose deaths at all-time highs, it remains very difficult for people to obtain medications used to treat opioid use disorder.
Doctors told him about myths and stigma surrounding methadone and buprenorphine, two highly effective medications that curb opioid cravings and withdrawals and vastly reduce the risk of a fatal overdose. People who wanted to quit opioids told of frustrating red tape and humiliating rules. Experts in Europe pointed out that drug deaths had radically dropped when the medications were made easier to access. A sweeping analysis of the nations addiction clinics helped him understand the financial interests shaping the industry. Fachers reporting revealed a de facto war on recovery one that costs the U.S. tens of thousands of lives each year.

As a Somali woman in long-term recovery, she's made it her mission to help others, especially in Minnesota's East African and Muslim communities, overcome it as well.
""You can just see problems and people struggling with addiction in plain sight,"" she said.
The opioid epidemic, fueled by a surge in fentanyl use, has shattered thousands of families across Minnesota. It has hit hardest among the state's people of color, who die at disproportionately high rates when compared with white Minnesotans.
American Indians were 12 times more likely than whites to die of an opioid-involved overdose in the state in 2022, while Black Minnesotans were four times more likely to die, according to preliminary data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
""[Opioid] overdose is an issue for the whole state of Minnesota,"" said Pearl Evans, a prevention program administrator for the state Department of Health. But, she said, ""the African American and the American Indian [communities] are the two racial groups that have the highest disparity. So those are our priorities to really reduce the burden on those two communities.""
In response, cities, counties and the state are pouring millions of dollars into culturally specific treatment programs, using money from national settlements in cases against opioid makers and distributors over their role in the crisis. The state Department of Human Services said it licenses 55 such programs.
Hennepin County allocated $8.8 million in opioid settlement money over two years to 41 culturally specific programs that fight opioid addiction and address systemic disparities. The focus is on African American, American Indian, East African communities and unsheltered homeless populations, county officials said.
The city of Minneapolis, which accounted for approximately a quarter of all opioid-related deaths in the state in 2022, has recently awarded nearly $374,000 to five community based organizations with the aim of increasing access to and options for treatment, recovery and prevention, particularly targeting underserved communities and youth.
""It's a scary time right now,"" said Lolita Ulloa, Hennepin County's director of system design. ""But really the sense of what is going to change is really based on the community.""
The county and state also are pushing efforts to gather additional race and ethnicity data to better identify needs and improve community engagement with inclusive language and better access to Naloxone, a drug that reverses opioid overdoses.
Lori Wilson, CEO of Turning Point, a longtime provider of culturally specific substance use disorder treatment for African Americans on Minneapolis' North Side, said opioid abuse ""has been devastating.""
Wilson said one of the barriers to treatment for people of color is ""cultural mistrust"" of health care professionals. That's where organizations like Turning Point, which has Black leadership and staff, can offer a sense of safety.
""If I have an opioid problem,"" Wilson said, ""it's unlikely I'm going to take it outside my community.""
Sharyl WhiteHawk is an enrolled member of the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Ojibwe in Wisconsin, and an addiction counselor at Khunsi Onikan treatment program at the American Indian Family Center in St. Paul.
She and others who work in the field point to the long history of persecution American Indians killed and pushed off their land by European settlers, forced erasure of language and culture at boarding schools that has reverberated through generations.
""What makes us much more vulnerable to overdose deaths is that we have so many layers of unresolved trauma and unresolved grief,"" she said. ""Because of the boarding school experience, the only coping skill that has been passed down is don't talk, don't tell and don't feel.""
As a result, American Indians involved in treatment programs say that a key to recovery is reintroducing the Native culture, including traditional ceremonies, and spirituality. For instance, a cedar healing ceremony uses traditional cedar medicine to wash away unresolved grief and trauma.
""Our cultures are a way of life, and our teachings show us how to be good human beings and in harmony with our creator,"" said Kateri Coyhis, an enrolled member of the Stockbridge-Munsee Community Band of Mohican Indians in Wisconsin and executive director of White Bison, a Native American nonprofit based in Colorado Springs. The organization provides culturally based programs and resources primarily geared for recovery from alcohol and substance use throughout the United States and Canada.
""I feel we're at war with fentanyl and opioids,"" said Stephen Montry, a licensed alcohol and drug counselor in the Twin Cities area and an enrolled member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation in South Dakota. Montry, a descendant of the White Earth Ojibwe Nation, lost a nephew to a fentanyl overdose in 2022.
""We need to get at the root why we're stuck in these patterns,"" he said.
From 2018 to 2022, 45 overdose deaths were recorded in Minnesota's Somali community, according to the Health Department. But state health officials caution even this number is an undercount.
The Minnesota Somali Community Center tries to track opioid overdose deaths with the help of Janazah Project MN, a Facebook page run by the funeral director of the Garden of Eden Islamic Cemetery in Burnsville. The community center said there were as many as 13 opioid related deaths in January 2024 alone.
""We are dealing with a crisis that we have never seen before and it's devastated almost every family in our community,"" executive director Hassanen Mohamed said.
Islam strictly prohibits the use of drugs, alcohol and other mind- and mood-altering substances, leading many Muslims to suffer in isolation and making the opioid crisis a ""silent killer"" in the East African Muslim community, Budul and other Somali professionals say.
Many families avoid reporting deaths as an overdose, instead attributing them to other causes, such as heart attacks and dying in sleep, to keep them out of official records. Some decline autopsies and toxicology tests, which would reveal those deaths, citing religious exemptions.
Budul is trying to address those challenges through her Niyyah Recovery Initiative. The nonprofit offers a blend of more culturally sensitive and faith-based approaches, including the first Islamic version of a 12-step program in Minnesota.
The program, Millati Islami meaning ""the path of peace"" was founded in Baltimore in 1980s to assist Muslims struggling with addiction find healing, support and guidance within the framework of Islam. The Minnesota chapter hosts Zoom discussions with its more than four dozen members at least three times a week.
""We need that cultural component, which really involves our spirituality, and connecting us back to Allah,"" said Budul, who also often shares her own story of battling addictions and shame to instill hope in others.
Meanwhile, at the Alliance Wellness Center in Bloomington, founder Yussuf Shafie grows frustrated as he reviews client files. He said he knows the available state-level data on opioid overdose in the Somali community doesn't match the sad reality.
""I went to many funerals that I cannot even count,"" said Shafie, a social worker. ""How does a 22-year-old or 24-year-old die in their sleep? I mean, people die all the time, but the story doesn't add up. There's just a lot of shame and stigma.""
The center recently expanded its services by adding eight beds for Muslim and East African women with opioid use disorder. It's one step, he hopes, in fulfilling a longstanding need.

Thats what the billboard says. Thats all the billboard saysFENTANYL in a cold, light blue, KILLS in stark white against an all-black background. Below is a woman on a gurney, treated with the same dead-blue tones as the script above her. Shes covered to her armpits in a sheet, arms at her sides, awaiting an autopsy. Anyone who has seen a cop drama in the past 30 years knows the image.
When an opioid user overdoses, their lips turn a cold, light blue. That was the color of my lips when I lay slumped in a pile outside the automatic doors of an emergency room. Jenny, the girl I had absconded from rehab with just days before, shouted for help, and once she saw the staff stir to action, jumped back in the car. Gustavo, who Jenny had guilted into driving, stepped on the gas, bald tires searching for traction before squealing to life, catapulting them into a night drowning in coastal fog. I imagined the diffuse light from cherry-red plastic growing faint, the EMERGENCY dissolving in their rearview. Im sure it was traumatic for them. Im sure they went back to our wretched motel room and immediately got high to blunt the terror. Thats what I would have done.
Splashed across the bottom right-hand corner of the billboard are the insignia of several city agencies proudly supporting its message. What is noticeably absent is any reference to a single resourcenot a website, not a phone number, not a mention of how someone might stop using fentanyl and thus avoid their impending death. The billboard looms large over a dirt lot dotted with tarps and tents and other telltale signs of DIY shelters in a southwest Fresno neighborhood where residents already know that fentanyl kills. Theyve lost all manner of kin. In addition to the billboard there are several video spots that run on local television and YouTube: a daughter dies on the floor of her parents bathroom; a father sobs over the loss of his precious teenage son, collapsing into the arms of his wife and remaining children.
Donnie, a friend of mine, died in a sober living house he once helped manage. I hadnt seen him in more than a year, but he was there for me when I was newly sober. He invited me to a gathering of young, sober men where they discussed the novel challenges facing them in the foreign land of abstinence. It turned out the group wasnt for meI didnt feel at home discussing MMA and motorcyclesbut I appreciated the gesture. Donnie and I remained friends, chatting frequently outside of meetings about skateboarding and getting locked up and being alive after almost being dead. A year later, when I learned he had overdosed, it stung in a way I wasnt prepared for. Donnie and I were very different, and we were the same. The thought that he wouldnt get another chance, not one more day, was devastating.
The billboard ad campaign is one of many tied to Californias $1 billion spending spree that is in part aimed at raising fentanyl awareness. In a local news interview, the Fresno superintendent of schools, who was charged with research and development for the project, seemed very pleased with himself. He wore the self-satisfied expression of a do-gooder doing good. He was proud of the message, touting his decision to ask local high schoolers for input, claiming that they had provided valuable information to help them target at-risk youth. In my experience, any teenager willing to work on an anti-drug campaign likely has no idea what at-risk teens need. Those at risk are not staying after school to brainstorm about what version of Just Say No is most potent; theyre off getting high somewhere.
Manystudies have been conducted on the effectiveness of fear-based abstinence programming, like DARE. The results are in: Fear does not reduce risky behavior in young people. Whether its drinking, puffing, fucking, snorting, or shooting, those most likely to engage in this kind of behavior are generally not moved by the spooky presentations given by the people who preach abstinence. And yet here are these billboards, millions and millions of dollars worth of them, sprouting up to the satisfaction of the well-meaners and the grim recognition of people who have, at some point or another, looked likely to become one of their cautionary tales. They are grand totems of denial to what might really stop these losses. No one is ready for that.

Every Friday at 10 a.m., my sixth-grade class gathered in the cafeteria. The officers uniform was tan and gold and blue, with crisp creases. He gave us all workbooks and lots of free swagpencils, bumper stickers, keychains. He taught us the deleterious effects of drug use, how one sip, puff, or sniff would ruin our lives forever. This all checked out, given the speeches I was getting at home.
My much older brother had started the emancipation process at 14, and subsequently went off to sip and snort and puff and play music and make art. Our mother cried about it openly and frequently, making me promisewhich I did, earnestlynever to engage in that kind of behavior. As such, I felt right at home in the DARE program, my hand constantly and confidently rocketing into the air with the answers to everything. My vehement support of abstinence earned me a gold medal made of bronzed metal. At 12, I was the absolute best at not doing drugs. By 14, if I was handed a pill and told it would make me feel goodor even just a little betterI swallowed it.

I also smoked a lot of weed. I found it helped soothe many of the symptoms associated with the myriad mental health diagnoses I had received. But for my mother and the psychiatrists, the idea that I would self-medicate was intolerable. They didnt want me to self-medicate; they wanted me to follow the medication regimen theyd prescribed. In no way am I knocking psychiatrypsychiatric medication has been profoundly life-altering for mebut I had to find that out for myself, years later. At 15, when I was handed all those diagnoses and the prescriptions that came with them, I felt powerless, forced to take what I perceived to be too many pills: Paxil and Seroquel and Zyprexa and Klonopin and Restoril, and on and on and on.
In America, there are two broad categories that drugs fall under: sanctioned and unsanctioned. Those who use the sanctioned drugs exactly the way they are told to are taking care of themselves. Those who use the unsanctioned drugs, or use sanctioned drugs in an unsanctioned fashion, are weak and sick and need help. In the United States, current drug policy is meant to stop unsanctioned drugs from entering the country, punish those who sell them, and force unsanctioned drug users to quit, often steering them toward the sanctioned drugs instead.  Because the supply of unsanctioned drugs is wholly unregulated, they often wind up doing much more damage than drugs made in laboratories with government oversight. And sanctioned drugs are simply far more expensive to procure and keep supplied. Many people who turn to fully unsanctioned drugs are trying to get relief for a whole lot cheaper than they can otherwise.
Both sanctioned and unsanctioned drugs can and do ruin lives and lead to death. (An obligatory rant about alcohol would typically come here, because it is a sanctioned drugas it should bebut it is also among the leading causes of preventable death in the United States.) Yet its unsanctioned drugs that usually capture the darker imagination of the public. Modern drug use epidemics that have real consequences for real people become entertainment, rife with sensationalized headlines that miss or misrepresent major aspects of whats happening, pretending to care about users while instead using their suffering to sell ads and supplement content for 24-hour news cycles. Current anti-drug legislation does something similar, with prosecutors across the nation dusting off laws created during the hysteria that accompanied the crack epidemic and retooling them for the current one. Teenagers with no intention of hurting anyone are being charged with murder for providing pills to their classmates. Thats not justice for the victimthats a head on a pike, a warning to people who sell unsanctioned drugs.
In truth, these overdose deaths are accidents that predominantly occur due to one key factor: the unregulated drug supply. Around the turn of the century, as prescription opioids began flooding American streets, overdoses did certainly rise; however, they did so at a much slower and steadier rate because the drugs were pharmaceutical grade and held to stringent FDA testing standards. When people bought an 80-milligram Oxycontin, they knew exactly what they were getting and in what quantity. It wasnt until that supply suddenly dried up that overdose deaths exploded. This is no surprise, given that the regulated, safer supply was replaced with an unregulated, unsafe supply of stronger drugs manufactured under dubious lab conditions.
Fentanyl itself isnt poisonit is a legitimate medication used in a wide variety of medical procedures every day. Anyone who has been put under for surgery has probably been on the stuff. But heres the thing about fentanyl: It is a fully synthetic opioid, meaning it can be produced in a lab with only chemicals, no finicky poppy crops needed. It is also quite a bit more potent than its cousins heroin, morphine, oxycodone, et al. This makes it easier to ship and distribute because every dose is of lower volume. Less is more. Around 2016, as doctors pulled back on prescribing opioids, labs in China began making fentanyl to fill the gap in supply. It was so cheap and so potent that cartels and street dealers started making counterfeit pills, buying presses so their product would look just like the prescription opioids their customers were familiar with. When a person is expecting a certain substance in a quantity theyre used to, but instead receives something much more potent, problems arise. Deaths occur. And right now, there is a whole lot of death.
Statistics alone dont paint the full picture. When I read articles chock-full of stats, I stop seeing people. I see numbers. Im a person who does better with visuals. For instance, how wide, how deep, would a grave need to be to accommodate the nearly 300,000 overdose victims from the past few years? I conjure images from pandemics and warsdead upon dead upon dead. Where did they OD? At home? In a car? A bathroom? The airport? Work? Donnie was on his bunk bed. Wherever it happened, they were individual people, each one a life. Fresno County decided theyd amalgamate them into one likeness, approximate them on a billboard to remind those who dont need the reminder: FENTANYL KILLS.
When I regained consciousness after my overdose, I was confused and pissed off. I had no idea where I was or why an intubation tube was being yanked from my throat. I started clawing at the mess of smaller tubes snaking from my veins. Nurses tried to hold me to the bed and talked sweetly to me. Their tone shifted when I asked the doctor if I was required by law to stay in the hospital. He cautioned me, strongly, against leaving, but also said he couldnt keep me there. In my small town, the police often showed up in ERs to questionand sometimes arrestoverdose victims. As I put on my pants, soaking wet from an ice bath at the motel (Jenny and Gustavos first attempt to reverse my overdose), and one remaining shoe, the nurses were angry. Ungrateful little shit, one of them muttered, side-eyeing me.
She was right. I was ungrateful. I didnt care about my life or all they had done to save it. I was a little resentful that they had bothered. When I asked where my missing clothes were, a nurse said theyd cut my shirt off with scissors before defibrillating. As for the shoe, she shrugged and told me Id arrived that way. I walked for the exit in my cold, damp pants, wearing one shoe and no shirt.
I tried to return home, which was upstairs at a Salvation Army, sleeping on the top bunk in a small room with 15 other guys. It was much better than where I had been sleeping: at the Rescue Mission, or under the freeway, or in a hole I dug next to the hull of a rentable catamaran pulled high onto dry sand. I felt safest by the catamaran, although sleeping on the beach in the middle of January was less than ideal, wet dew soaking through my hood, pulled and tied tight, a sopping mummy in a shallow grave. When the staff found out about the ODtipped off when the hospital was calling around trying to find someone to claim methey put me back out on the street for violating the rules. For using drugs. Back to that shallow grave.
I didnt want to die. I simply wasnt ready to stop blotting out memories I spent nearly all my time trying to outmaneuver.
Within a few days, I was getting high again. I was, though, a tad more careful in the dose department, given my near-death experience. Deep down, I didnt want to die. I simply wasnt ready to stop blotting out those memories I spent nearly all my time trying to outmaneuver. I wasnt ready to face my trauma or what I had done to others in the subsequent yearsI just wanted a break. For many years, getting that break was priority No. 1. I couldnt yet imagine another way.
While California recently allocated part of their $1 billion fentanyl bill to future fear campaigns like the one in Fresno, Congress is seeking to continue funding something called the SUPPORT Act, which set up a $20 billion fund to help state and local governments access money to treat those in their communities with opioid use disorder. This is a good thing. Offering treatment is most certainly better than trying to scare people straight. It isnt, however, working. Since they passed the act in 2019, overdose deaths have continued to soar. Meanwhile, America continues to invest resources that dwarf that total in the war on drugs, which just about everyone agrees has been an abject failure of almost unfathomable scope and consequences.
To the north, there is another view. Vancouvers Downtown Eastside neighborhood, like the rest of North America, has an overdose problem. The scene there can be pretty grimthrongs of people sleeping on sidewalks, or shuffling around, dead on their feet, so to speak. There is no denying that a lifetime of drug use can, indeed, be pretty grim. Even if a person doesnt die from overdose, veins collapse, abscesses emerge, bloodborne pathogens proliferate, and a lack of proper hygiene or nutrition leads to rashes, infections, tooth decay, and emaciation. It has also led, in many cases, to abject poverty, hopelessness, and despair. Its worth acknowledging that this is the far end on a spectrum, and that there are plenty of dependent users living what most consider a normal life, camouflaged among all the other normal lives. Still, this neighborhood in Vancouver isnt hiding the potential consequences of drug dependence.
Canadian law, while certainly not perfect, does allow for a measure of compassion that the United States decidedly does not. Vancouver, along with some other cities in Canada, has institutionally staffed safe injection sites and needle exchange programs, not to mention universal coverage for medical and mental health care, including treatment for substance use disorder. And on the revolutionary fringe of Canadian law is a precarious operation run by compassionate medical professionals, a pilot program that actually prescribes diacetylmorphinemore commonly known as herointo patients who are chronically dependent. Most of these folks have been using for 20 years or more, but now, they travel down to the clinic four times a day to get their fix. (Eligibility requirements vary, but typically only people who are diagnosed with treatment-resistant substance use disorder and are actively using illegal street drugs qualify.) According to a doctor who once ran the program and was interviewed for the documentary Opioid Tragedy, chronic users who participate in the program are no longer required to spend all their time and money procuring drugs by any means necessary. So instead, they do things like reunite with family, get jobs, go back to school, attain housing. One patient, a man who has robbed 60 banks and spent decades in prison, was also interviewed. Im grateful to say that Im now a retired bank robber, he said. He is not alone: other reporting bears out how the program has transformed lives in Canada.
This may seem hard to fathom. Giving people these drugs? There are certainly critics: Some suggest the safe-supply drugs could end up resold on the streets, while others believe administering them violates a doctors oath to do no harm. (Those same doctors often push people toward opioid substitution therapy, which is the practice of prescribing opioids to treat use disordersin other words, safely supplying opioids.) And the idea remains a third rail in America, where New York City only recently opened the nations first safe-use clinicin which drug users are supervised, but bring their own drugsand the Biden administration is still in the early stages of quietly studying the efficacy of such sites. While policymakers in the United States tinker with the bare minimum, the Vancouver programs are actually addressing the dangers inherent to an unsanctioned drug supply that contains unknowable amounts of fentanyl and its analogs. It has been running for about a decade, during which it has provided a stable of research on the matter. The public health response to a poisoning epidemic must be to provide a safer alternative, as one researcher put it. Unless there is a radical change in our approach to the epidemic, overdose deaths will continue unabated. The results are promising, particularly in avoiding preventable death, and researchers are steadilyconductingstudies that are providing much-needed insight into what has been, historically, an elusive population.
These developments make me both hopeful and a little weary. Academics do studies; substance use specialists tout treatments. Im not an expert, but I reckon the reason our federal government can spend a collective $60 billion a year on prevention and treatment and still see an astronomical increase in deaths is simple: The prescribed method doesnt work. There are lots of nuanced elements at play here, but at the center is something fairly straightforward: the collective wemeaning the majority of American citizens and nearly all policymakerscannot stomach the idea that we would let people get high on unsanctioned drugs. That concept is beyond whats tolerable. We feel we must save people from themselves.
What I want to know is: Why doesnt anyone ask us?
When I saw that dead body on the billboard, casting a long, dark shadow over a suffering community that didnt need its message, a deep sadness washed through me, followed by an all-too-familiar sense of resignation. Its a common scenario: The government folds to pressure, knowing it must do something about a problem, but is more interested in optics than meaningful intervention. I was staring at a billboard that offered a generic message above a terrifying image, with all those official logos poised as endorsements along its bottom border. Advertisements. Like they were supporting something noble. But being noble is not what theyre interested in. Not really. They just know they need to do something. The billboard is, I suppose, a thing. And thats all it is.
The first day I drove by it, I began researching its origins right when I got home. What I found first were several news stories lauding the effort. What struck me most was the disconnect. No one seemed to know anything meaningful about the problemnot the newscasters, not the City Council officials, not the teens who helped develop the messageaside from the fact that fentanyl causes death. I also found the campaign was not a one-off: Another had been developed by a local woman who lost her son to an overdose. It was crafted using the same kind of frightening imagerythe Grim Reaper, skull and crossbones, etc.only the slogan was ONE PILL CAN KILL. I have no doubt this mother was grieving the loss of her son and wanted nothing more than to save another parent from her pain. I know that at least some of these people have the best intentions. Unfortunately, there exists a cavernous gap, a fundamental chasm, with fear-based and ultimately meaningless signals on one side, and the complicated nature of saving lives in an often maligned and misunderstood community of chronic users on the other.
It does no good to blame policymakers or journalists or the public for this misunderstandingit is a narrative that has been passed down through generations. What I want to know is: Why doesnt anyone ask us? So much time and money and energy are spent trying to prevent people from using drugs, while almost none is spent trying to mitigate the effects of something that is, quite frankly, not preventable. Americas appetite for drugs has a one-way trajectory: up. Part of the solution can be educationreal education, based on scientific evidence, centering harm reduction rather than abstinencebut that doesnt seem to be of much interest. The collective agreement is that if we can scare the kids, they wont do drugs. With hundreds of thousands of overdoses in recent years, something tells me the kids of my generation werent sufficiently scared into abstinence, nor was the generation that has come of age since. The politics of fear has proven quite effective in elections but pretty useless when it comes between a person and their vices.
At the time of my overdose, I was actively driving my life off a cliff. In the years following, I got a steady job, sought therapy, and stopped engaging in much of my former high-risk behavior. I wouldnt, however, stop using for a number of years. By then, I was leading what many consider a normal life. It was still full of dysfunction, but I managed to keep my job, my car, my housing, my marriage, my friendsall the things one points to and says, Look. Normal! I was able to stop using thanks in part to medically assisted treatment, and Im very grateful for that. But that was just one piece. It also took a lot of hard work to become healthy again, and I had many luxuries that many with my disorder arent afforded: health care, a supportive network of people, and enough money to get by while I sorted myself out. There are plenty of users who would likely start seeing a profound difference in their lives if they simply stopped having to hustle for dope, if they didnt have to congregate in the liminal spaces where we herd the dispossessed, and if, instead, they obtained their drug of choice legally, from licensed clinicians who care.
The above idea likely causes many readers to squirm. But if there were a sincere interest in damming the flood of death swallowing up so many lives, it is what we would do. The way things are set up now, a drug user has two choices: get treatment in whatever fashion is mandated or keep using and work their way toward death. Dependent users know a thing or two about the loss of autonomythey live every day at the behest of their habit. Many would stop if they could. And perhaps, if given the chance to do so in their own time, in their own way, they would eventually stop using. But why must that be a requirement? Why must a user do it the way theyre told, or else risk losing access to services? Its just another way to dehumanize drug users, assuming they cant possibly know whats right for them. While its true that many drug users engage in self-destructive behavior, much of that behavior stems from the fact that theyve been relegated to the edges of society. Shamed into isolation. Exiled.

FENTANYL KILLS. A dead body. Those are the only two things on that billboard. It isnt a liefentanyl is killing a lot of people. The grave is wide, long, and deep, and growing more cavernous every year. But that billboard is not, in any way, helping. It is, in fact, a callous disregard for human life. The billboard towers over a community in desperate need of aid. It represents millions of dollars spent trying to scare people into abstaining from use altogether rather than implementing policy initiatives that might prevent fentanyl overdoses. With all the money currently being hurled at the problem, creating an emergency order that includes a safe supply for dependent users is an actionable solution. Saving lives might not look the way many envision it. And unfortunately, it seems that without that vision, which always seems to include some version of the sparkling redemption narrative, no one is interested.

The study, ""Reversal of opioid-induced respiratory depression in healthy volunteers: comparison of intranasal nalmefene and intranasal naloxone"", was published in the Journal of Clinical Pharmacology (Reversal of OpioidInduced Respiratory Depression in Healthy Volunteers: Comparison of Intranasal Nalmefene and Intranasal Naloxone - Ellison - The Journal of Clinical Pharmacology - Wiley Online Library
) and is the first head-to-head comparison examining the effects of 2.7 mg intranasal (IN) nalmefene (OPVEE) and 4 mg IN naloxone on opioid-induced respiratory depression. This study was a part of the OPVEE development program and reviewed by the FDA as part of the approval process.
This study met the primary endpoint by demonstrating that OPVEE reversed the respiratory depression produced by remifentanil, a potent synthetic opioid related to fentanyl, within the first 5 minutes following administration. Both OPVEE and IN naloxone produced a time-dependent reversal of the opioid-induced respiratory depression 2.5 to 20 minutes post administration. Point estimates favored OPVEE, demonstrating non-inferiority and superiority to naloxone. After OPVEE administration, subjects' minute ventilation (a measure of the amount of air that enters the lungs per minute) reached approximately 95% of the pre-opioid baseline within 5 minutes and maintained this robust reversal through the initial 20-minute monitoring period. By contrast, naloxone required 20 minutes to restore respiration to levels equaling those observed 5 minutes after OPVEE. There is an urgent need for rapid acting reversal agents because synthetic opioids, like fentanyl, impair breathing and reduce oxygen levels to vital organs like the brain more rapidly than other opioids such as morphine and heroin. 
""This study provides the first head-to-head comparison of IN OPVEE and IN naloxone in a clinical model of opioid-induced respiratory depression. While both reverse the effects of remifentanil induced respiratory depression, this pharmacodynamic study provides important insights about the time course of reversal for both drugs,"" said Christian Heidbreder, Ph.D. and Chief Scientific Officer of Indivior. ""The first few minutes following an overdose particularly with very potent and fast acting synthetic opioids like fentanyl are critical for a successful rescue. OPVEE reverses the respiratory depression rapidly in this model, making it a valuable tool for combating the synthetic opioid overdose crisis we're facing as a nation.""
Following administration of OPVEE, subjects' minute ventilation (MV), a measure of how much a person is breathing, increased by an average of 5.75 L/min at 5 minutes, the study's primary endpoint. Intranasal naloxone produced a mean increase of 3.01 L/min at 5 minutes post-administration, and 20 minutes was required to produce an increase in MV similar to that observed 5 minutes after OPVEE.
Adverse events (AEs) occurred in 91.8% of subjects following OPVEE and 86.7% of subjects following IN naloxone. The authors conclude that the AEs observed in this study are most likely related to remifentanil and hypercapnic experimental conditions used and not the drugs under investigation. The most common adverse events were headache (59.0% following OPVEE and 58.3% following intranasal naloxone), nausea (39.3% and 41.7%), vomiting (11.5% and 23.3%), and dizziness (18.0% and 21.7%). Adverse events were mild or moderate, with no subjects reporting a serious adverse event.
In the United States, the provisional number of reported opioid overdose deaths reached 80,318 in the 12 months ending in September 2023.1 The reported overdose deaths linked to synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, during the same period was 73,686, representing more than 90% of all opioid overdose fatalities.
About the Study
This study was an open-label, head-to-head, randomized, 2-period, 2-treatment crossover noninferiority study designed to model the pharmacodynamic effects of intranasal OPVEE® (nalmefene) and intranasal naloxone. A total of 69 opioid-experienced, non -dependent healthy male and female volunteers were randomized to receive study drugs. Subjects breathed a hypercapnic gas mixture containing 7% carbon dioxide and their minute ventilation (MV) was monitored. Minute ventilation is a measure of how deeply and rapidly a patient is breathing and is reduced by opioid exposure.2 Previous work has demonstrated that opioids blunt the increase in MV that normally occurs with hypercapnia (excessive carbon dioxide in the bloodstream) and that opioid antagonists can reverse this effect.3-7 After 10 minutes of breathing the hypercapnic gas mixture, subjects were administered a loading dose of remifentanil followed by a continuous infusion of remifentanil to maintain steady state plasma concentrations. After 25 minutes, the subjects were administered a single dose of either intranasal OPVEE 2.7 mg or intranasal naloxone 4 mg and MV was monitored. The primary objectives were to demonstrate noninferiority at the primary endpoint of 5 minutes after antagonist exposure of IN nalmefene to reverse remifentanil-induced reductions in MV and to determine the tolerability of IN nalmefene during remifentanil infusion. Of the 69 subjects who received a single dose of either IN nalmefene or IN naloxone, a total of 52 subjects received both treatments and data was collected at the primary endpoint in 50 subjects.
About OPVEE® 
OPVEE (nalmefene) nasal spray
INDICATION
OPVEE nasal spray is an opioid antagonist indicated for the emergency treatment of known or suspected overdose induced by natural or synthetic opioids in adults and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older, as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression.
OPVEE nasal spray is intended for immediate administration as emergency therapy in settings where opioids may be present.
OPVEE nasal spray is not a substitute for emergency medical care.
HIGHLIGHTED SAFETY INFORMATION
CONTRAINDICATIONS
Hypersensitivity to nalmefene or to any of the other ingredients.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
Risk of Recurrent Respiratory and Central Nervous System Depression
: While the duration of action of nalmefene is as long as most opioids, a recurrence of respiratory depression is possible, therefore, keep patient under continued surveillance and administer repeat doses of OPVEE using a new nasal spray with each dose, as necessary, while awaiting emergency medical assistance.
Limited Efficacy with Partial Agonists or Mixed Agonist/Antagonists
: Reversal of respiratory depression caused by partial agonists or mixed agonists/antagonists, such as buprenorphine and pentazocine, may be incomplete. Larger or repeat doses may be required.
Precipitation of Severe Opioid Withdrawal
: Use in patients who are opioid dependent may precipitate opioid withdrawal. In neonates, opioid withdrawal may be life-threatening if not recognized and properly treated. Monitor for the development of opioid withdrawal.
Risk of Cardiovascular (CV) Effects
: Abrupt postoperative reversal of opioid depression may result in adverse CV effects. These events have primarily occurred in patients who had preexisting CV disorders or received other drugs that may have similar adverse CV effects. Monitor these patients closely in an appropriate healthcare setting after use of nalmefene hydrochloride.
Risk of Opioid Overdose from Attempts to Overcome the Blockade
: Attempts to overcome opioid withdrawal symptoms caused by opioid antagonists with high or repeated doses of exogenous opioids may lead to opioid intoxication and death.
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Most common adverse reactions (incidence at least 2%) are nasal discomfort, headache, nausea, dizziness, hot flush, vomiting, anxiety, fatigue, nasal congestion, throat irritation, rhinalgia, decreased appetite, dysgeusia, erythema, and hyperhidrosis.

Read Part 1.
Part 3 coming March 19
DETROIT Every morning, Rebecca Smith, nursing a surgically repaired knee, carefully walks down the hallway of her brutalist brick apartment building, takes the elevator one floor to the lobby, and negotiates the sharply angled driveway outside. There, she waits for an Uber to take her to the last place she wants to go: her methadone clinic.
It is her most despised ritual. Smith, 65, is a former medical assistant, a grandmother, and a widow. She has not used illegal drugs in over five years, thanks in large part to methadone, a common medication that is highly effective at treating opioid addiction. But methadone, which once promised Smith freedom from drugs, has made her a prisoner to the drug-treatment system. Like hundreds of thousands of other Americans, she spends each morning journeying to and from her clinic, all so she can wait in line to swallow a small cups worth of medication.
Smiths life has not always revolved around her methadone clinic. Until recently, she was required to show up only once every two weeks. At each visit, shed take one dose in person, then receive another 13 to take at home.  But now, the clinic had forced her to come in each morning: the consequence, it says, for partaking in a celebratory toast at her grandsons high-school graduation party. Smith, who said she had a few sips from a single glass of wine, was accused by the clinic of abusing alcohol and lost the permission to receive her take-home doses. No longer free for her early-morning shifts at a catering company, Smith told the clinic doctor that she faced an unthinkable choice. If he wanted her to attend the clinic daily, shed have to quit her job.
Im going to church, I got my bank account, Im part of society, Ive got my life in order, she recalled saying. Its been over five years, and youre gonna do this to me? I said, yall doing stuff like this makes people go out there and relapse. Its like you dont care.
Smiths medical records confirm her account. But the clinic was unswayed. As she predicted, Smith was forced to choose her medication over her job. Within weeks, she was late on rent for the apartment shes lived in for over a decade. In the ensuing three months, Smith dutifully showed up at the clinic each morning. She didnt consume alcohol or illegal drugs in any quantity. She begged her clinic to restore her take-home doses, restore her freedom, and allow her to return to work. But the clinic hasnt backed down.
Smith is far from the only patient whose stability, and survival, are being jeopardized by iron-fisted methadone clinics, also known as opioid treatment programs (OTPs). A STAT investigation shows that many of the nations methadone clinics rely on controlling and punitive strategies that make it harder, not easier, for patients to maintain their recovery.
There is little evidence to support many of the clinics practices. Some clinic staff participating in medical decisions have no training in medicine.
As over 80,000 Americans die each year from opioid overdoses, patient advocates, public health experts, and doctors have increasingly come to question why methadone is accessible only at some 2,000 specialized clinics, many of which enforce outdated rules and offer low-quality care. The immense time commitment that daily clinic visits require, they argue, can also prevent patients from focusing on aspects of life that could aid their recovery, like their work, family, or education.
Though federal regulators recently moved to loosen the regulations governing OTPs, even clinics attempting to provide convenient, compassionate care are still constricted by federal and local policy. Across the country, hundreds of clinics are required to supervise patients while they give urine samples, either in person or through a live video feed; restricted from prescribing doses large enough to alleviate patients withdrawal symptoms; and encouraged to taper patients off the medication after a set period, a practice that leading addiction researchers say is dangerous and unsupported by science.
In interviews, leaders in the world of methadone treatment advocacy acknowledged that the system has been slow to evolve since its inception over 50 years ago. But they stressed that the restrictions are intended as a safety measure: Methadone is itself an opioid, and when taken in excess, or in combination with other substances, can cause sedation or even overdose.
The primary opioid of abuse is fentanyl, said Mark Parrino, the founder and president of the American Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence (AATOD), a national advocacy organization that represents methadone clinics. When youre dealing with untreated fentanyl use, the idea of introducing another opiate, methadone, to treat [patients] has risks.
The strict protocols create a fundamental paradox: People with the most severe addictions are probably the least able to show up at a clinic each morning, and the least able to pay for treatment, which varies widely in price but often costs patients without insurance over $100 per week. As a result, those who need methadone the most are often the people who can access it the least.
Alienated by the clinics rigid controls, people who use drugs are often driven away from methadone treatment or never seek it in the first place. At some programs, the high cost of care and lack of flexibility has led many patients to view fentanyl use as a cheaper, easier, and even safer option than enrolling in a methadone clinic.
By limiting methadone to this one structure, all this power has accumulated in one space, said Danielle Russell, an advocate, researcher, and methadone patient whose Ph.D. focused on methadone access. The clinics always make it clear to you that at any moment, they could snatch away a medication that helps you maintain stability and feel safe. There are no other options, and the clinics know that, and they treat you as such. Its hellacious.

The most restricted medication
Methadone was developed in pre-World War II Germany as a pain medication, and was first tested as a treatment for opioid addiction in the 1960s. In the U.S., methadone and buprenorphine, another addiction medication, are the only two drugs approved to treat the severe withdrawal and cravings that occur when people who use opioids suddenly stop. In the era of ultra-potent synthetic drugs like fentanyl, patients and doctors alike say it is all but impossible to quit illicit opioids without the aid of either medication.
Methadone is the more effective of the two medications: Research shows that people who take it are 59% less likely to die of an opioid overdose. Despite the magnitude of the U.S. overdose epidemic, however, methadone remains the countrys most difficult medication to obtain. While any licensed doctor can prescribe methadone to treat pain, no doctor is permitted to write a methadone prescription to treat addiction, and patients like Smith cant simply pick up their medication at a local pharmacy. Instead, they must enroll in specialized clinics that, due to federal law, hold the exclusive right to distribute methadone as an addiction treatment and therefore hold enormous control over their patients lives.
Clinics say these rules are necessary to protect patients. Beyond potential side effects like heavy sweating, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction, methadone can cause overdose when used in excess or in combination with other medications. The risk appears greater when methadone is prescribed to treat pain, not addiction: Washington state, for example, saw a spike in methadone overdoses in the mid-2000s after its Medicaid program and other public insurers, in a bid to save money, began pushing patients toward methadone as an everyday pain drug. As an addiction treatment, too, methadone has risks. One study linked an uptick in methadone-involved deaths from 2019 to 2020 to methadone clinics more relaxed practices during the Covid-19 pandemic, though it noted the data does not allow for a causal attribution.
But overall, methadone causes far less harm than other opioids. The annual total of methadone-involved overdose deaths has remained roughly constant over the past decade, even as overall opioid deaths have skyrocketed. Of the 82,807 opioid overdose deaths recorded in 2022, 3,364 involved methadone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of those deaths, roughly two-thirds also involved an opioid besides methadone, like fentanyl or a prescription painkiller. Research also shows that even as methadone clinics significantly relaxed their restrictions and allowed more take-home medication in 2020, the share of opioid overdose deaths that involved methadone declined.
Still, many Americans view the medication as hardly better than the potent opioids, like fentanyl and heroin, that people taking methadone no longer wish to use. Separately, some clinicians warn that wider access could lead to an increase in overdoses caused by methadone itself.
When patients with severe fentanyl addiction and intertwined mental health conditions seek addiction treatment, high-quality care should entail more than just medication, said Kenneth Stoller, a Johns Hopkins addiction psychiatrist and member of AATODs board. To provide methadone without safeguards, he said, could spark even more backlash against a medication that society already views with suspicion.
All we need are a few front-page stories about how a drug got into the hands of a baby who died of an overdose, or how a person leaving home after taking too much of their medication got into a car accident and killed a family, he said. We will see a resurgence of severe stigma toward that medication.
So far, methadone clinics have gotten their way. Though addiction doctors in Germany, Australia, Canada, and other high-income countries can prescribe methadone directly to patients, in the U.S., it remains available only at specialized opioid treatment programs.

Indignities and red tape
Patients at methadone clinics go to extraordinary lengths to receive their medication, complying with rules and suffering indignities that would be unthinkable in any other health care setting. Patients commonly sign lengthy contracts agreeing to abide by clinic policies, and are often required to participate in frequent drug tests and counseling sessions as a condition of receiving their medication. In interviews, several patients, across multiple clinics, reported that they were admonished by clinic staff for not saying please or thank you.
Even minor violations of clinic rules can result in major punishments. The total submissiveness that methadone treatment typically requires has led patients to bestow the medication with a damning nickname: liquid handcuffs.
Above all, clinics rules center on the requirement that patients come in each day to receive their dose. Some are eventually granted take-home privileges, in methadone clinic parlance. Others, however, have attended their clinics daily for years without earning take-homes.
Often, patients who do receive take-homes must comply with strict rules that clinics say are designed to prevent misuse: They must bring a locked container to the clinic to store their doses, and bring back all of their empty methadone bottles every visit. Patients are also frequently subjected to call-backs: being told, without warning, that they have mere hours to show up at the clinic for inspection, medication bottles in hand. Punishment for not showing up for a call-back or a missing bottle may include having take-home doses reduced or rescinded entirely, leaving patients constantly at their clinics beck and call.
Every methadone clinic has got to look very deeply at themselves, and at their current policies, and they need to be rewritten, said Ruth Potee, an addiction doctor who runs several methadone clinics in Massachusetts. If you have not changed the number of take-home bottles youre giving, then shame on you.

While clinics cast daily in-person dosing as a safety measure, patients and some leading addiction doctors increasingly argue that the requirement is harmful and in many cases unnecessary. For those attempting to move forward from their addiction, clinic visits provide a daily reminder of a history theyd rather forget. Others attempting to stay sober find the visits to be a distraction, or even a threat to their recovery: In interviews, multiple patients reported being offered illicit fentanyl for sale while they waited in line.
Daily dosing also poses logistical hurdles that force patients to structure their lives around their clinics dosing hours. Kevin Saunders, who attends a clinic in Biloxi, Miss., recounted a 5:30 a.m. frenzy each day as patients waiting for their clinic to open repeatedly pressed a button on a cellphone app, waiting for an automated system to assign them a place in line. Hitting the button just a few seconds late, he said, could be the difference between waiting five minutes and waiting an hour.
Ryan Fisher of Buckeye, Ariz., said he was denied take-homes despite consistent attendance and negative drug tests because the nearest clinic located in Phoenix, a nearly two-hour round trip misplaced his records, accused him of skipping appointments, and made no allowances for absences he had verified were due to his work schedule. Fisher eventually decided methadone treatment wasnt worth the expense and inconvenience of driving over 400 miles each week. He quit the medication cold turkey, a process he described as the worst three months of my life.
Some patients spoke fondly of their counselors, crediting them with providing structure and guidance that helped them remain in treatment and move past their addiction. Others, however, cast the requirement that they participate in counseling as an obstacle to their care, or a means of boosting their clinics revenues. Russell, the methadone treatment researcher, said her counseling appointments at a Phoenix-area clinic often consisted solely of making sure she had paid her most recent clinic bills. She has since moved to Australia for a postdoctoral fellowship and because methadone there is far easier to access.
Every methadone clinic has got to look very deeply at themselves, and at their current policies, and they need to be rewritten.
Ruth Potee, addiction doctor
Little data is available about the quality of counseling at methadone clinics, and there is no federal standard for counselors qualifications. Longstanding federal guidelines acknowledge that many states permit non-licensed addictions counselors who may be qualified for their positions through training, education, and/or experience. One federal report from 2019 found great diversity and a lack of a standard model for counseling services offered alongside methadone or buprenorphine treatment.
Parrino, the head of the clinics advocacy group, acknowledged that in some cases, clinics fail to offer high-quality counseling.
Why do we need counseling if the counseling is crap? Its a fair question, Parrino said. This is where I happen to be aligned with the patient advocacy groups, and always have been: If the program is counter-therapeutic, if the policies are counter-therapeutic, if youre not engaging patients, if youre antagonizing or alienating the patients, you have to question what youre doing.
Patients also reported alienating experiences related to drug testing. Some clinics require supervision while patients provide a urine sample either via camera or even from inside a bathroom stall. Many clinics use drug tests to determine whether their patients still use illicit substances, and shape their medical decisions accordingly. But clinics also commonly use the tests as justification to restrict take-home medication and to require their patients to attend more frequently not just when they test positive for illegal drugs or alcohol, but also, in some cases, when patients test positive for marijuana, even in states where marijuana is legal.
Other patients said their clinics made it difficult to receive methadone doses that adequately quelled withdrawal symptoms throughout their 24-hour dosing interval. Beth Miller, who recently switched to a clinic in Connecticut, said her new provider has balked at requests to raise her dose to the level she safely took for 14 years while living a short drive away in Rhode Island.
And while many patients prefer to split their dose in half so that they dont begin to feel withdrawal symptoms later in the day, many clinics insist that they take it all at once.
On the whole, the patients who recounted their experience said the clinics rigid policies made methadone treatment so difficult that some contemplated swearing off the medication altogether. In many cases, those who did returned to using heroin or fentanyl almost immediately.
Almost every single person I know who has overdosed has been on methadone at some point, and couldnt hack the restrictions or was terminated for some arbitrary reason, said Caty Simon, an advocate with the Urban Survivors Union and co-author of the Methadone Manifesto, a 2021 call for major reforms to the methadone treatment system.
These practices speak to the same fundamental issue, said Potee, the Massachusetts addiction doctor. Many methadone clinics behavior isnt designed to reduce patients odds of overdose, relapse, or death, she argued instead, its geared toward maximizing billable events and minimizing the risk of diversion, when clinic-prescribed methadone is misused or sold on the black market.
Quality of care for patients is driven by the financial bottom line, she said.
From a punitive place
When the Nixon administration legalized methadone treatment in the 1970s, it viewed the system more as a crime-reduction tool rather than a means of providing health care. Experts on both sides of the methadone debate acknowledge that the system hasnt fully moved past its war on drugs roots: Some clinics still operate largely as they did over 50 years ago.
In an interview, Nick Stavros, the CEO of the fast-growing clinic chain Community Medical Services, acknowledged that the federal regulations that first created the methadone system came from a punitive place.
As a country, we do not treat addiction from a health care perspective, he said. We treat it from a punitive perspective. The federal regulations as they previously existed created a power differential where patients had less of a voice in their treatment.
Parrino, the AATOD president, agreed that the original system created a structure that would lead to very conservative judgments. He acknowledged, too, that many workers at OTPs still treat patients more like inmates. But he said those clinics are the exception, and most clinics today display far more compassion for patients than their critics believe.
I dont agree with the view that the treatment settings are now more of an incarcerated environment, he said. However, in fairness, I would say that there are some program staff that operate as if they were in an incarcerated setting. I do not think it defines the system.
While some methadone clinics choose to impose cumbersome restrictions on their patients, others do so because they have no choice. At the federal level, and in dozens of states, laws and regulations require clinics to enforce rules that are not based on medical evidence and, in some cases, punish patients in ways that harm their health.
Federal laws require a set number of drug screens and encourage call-backs for patients receiving take-home doses. Regulations at the state level can be even more stringent, often mandating a minimum number of counseling sessions as a condition of participating in treatment. Many state regulators, also, have actively opposed the more flexible rules issued by the federal government during the Covid-19 pandemic namely allowing more generous take-home doses.
According to the Pew Charitable Trusts, eight states also view discontinuation as the ultimate goal of methadone treatment, regardless of medical circumstance, even though the American Society of Addiction Medicine opposes discontinuation absent medical necessity or a patients preference. More than 50% of patients return to illicit opioid use within one month of discontinuing medication treatment, according to a recent study.
In every state besides Massachusetts and South Dakota, clinics are allowed to kick patients out for violating program rules. Many addiction experts have stressed, however, that the moments when patients violate program rules when they use illicit drugs, miss doses, or fail to show up for counseling sessions are the moments that put them at highest risk for overdose and in the greatest need of treatment. Several states also require clinics to notify regulators before prescribing a methadone dose higher than 120 milligrams, even as some patients attempting to quit fentanyl require doses twice or even three times as high.
In interviews, executives at methadone clinic chains acknowledged that, in many cases, federal and local regulations dont match their clinical judgment, including requirements that patients participate in a set number of counseling sessions.
We dont think people should be forced into it, said Ben Nordstrom, the chief medical officer of Behavioral Health Group, a major clinic chain. We operate in some states where there is a minimum counseling frequency, and we have to color within those lines.
Similarly, Nordstrom said that while he believes marijuana use is clinically irrelevant to his work, state regulations often leave his hands tied.
I couldnt care less about smoking pot, and I dont think anybody I work with cares, he said. But if theres a state regulation that youve got to treat cannabis the same way youd treat cocaine, what do we do?
Though he welcomed the relaxed federal rules, Nordstrom acknowledged their impact may be limited: The federal government has no power to compel states to treat clinics with more leniency. Likewise, while state regulators can loosen local restrictions, they have no mechanism to compel individual clinics to take advantage of those flexibilities and offer more patient-centered care.
For decades, methadone treatment has also faced intense cultural and political resistance. Last year alone, community activists held protests opposing the opening of new clinics in New York, Washington state, and Virginia. In the 1990s, national figures like Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani (R) sought to effectively ban funding for clinics. Smiths birthplace of West Virginia, home to the nations highest opioid death rate, has enforced a moratorium on new methadone clinics since 2007.
Despite the cumbersome regulations, some experts say that truly motivated clinic directors could still work within existing rules to provide flexible, compassionate care and still, many choose not to.
OTP medical directors have always had the opportunity to be creative and figure out how to provide high-quality care, said Frances McGaffey, the Pew Charitable Trusts researcher who assembled a comprehensive analysis of state policies governing methadone treatment. But not all of them have taken advantage of that, or have had the capacity to figure out workarounds.
This is not helping me
Rebecca Smith was born in January 1959, the ninth of 12 siblings in Hinton, W.Va., a rural town of roughly 5,000 at the time. At 18, she moved to Michigan to be near her uncles and because, she felt, there were no jobs for Black people in West Virginia.
Her path to heroin, and then to treatment, began nearly three decades ago. By then, Smith had married, settled in Detroit, and started a family. Her husband, Ronald White, worked on the assembly line at Ford Motor Company; she worked as a medical assistant.
But in 1996, White died in his early 40s of pancreatic and liver cancer a destabilizing loss that led Smith to turn to drugs in an effort to mask her grief.
It just seemed like I was thrown into the world naked, with nothing, Smith said. I love my children deeply. I love them so much. But it was just really hard for me to accept his death. And thats when I started using.
The next two decades were a roller coaster: Smith used, then quit, then used more, then quit again. She lost custody of her two youngest children. She was diagnosed with kidney cancer. And she fought her first battle against a methadone treatment provider: After having a kidney surgically removed, Smith said one clinic falsely accused her of drinking too much water in an effort to skew the results of her urine drug screens. The clinic tapered her off the medication without her consent and ejected her from its care. She soon relapsed, kicking off another yearslong cycle of heroin use.
Eventually, Smith settled into the treatment program at Tolan Park Research Clinic in Detroits Midtown neighborhood, showing up daily until the clinic finally awarded her multiple days of take-home medication, then a week, then two weeks. She took a job with a catering company owned by her daughter, Tameca.
Smith felt that her redemption arc was complete. She had conquered heroin addiction. She had made amends with her children including two younger sons who were adopted after child protective services intervened.
Then she celebrated her grandsons graduation from Cass Tech, a prestigious Detroit high school, with a few sips of wine. The next morning, she went to her clinic to receive her two weeks of take-home doses, meet with her counselor, and drop clinic slang for leaving a urine sample for a drug test.
Alcohol metabolites later showed up on the urine screen, and Smith was honest with her counselor about having partaken in the celebratory toasts.
But staff at her clinic didnt see the family celebration as a triumph. Though Smith has never exhibited problems related to drinking, Tolan Park accused her of abusing alcohol and rescinded her take-home medications.

Smith was forced to quit her job. She does not own a car. Thanks to a recent knee surgery, and an anticipated second procedure she was forced to postpone once the clinic made her attend daily, making the 1-mile journey on foot is not an option. In Detroit, neither is public transportation. Smith, instead, has had to take an Uber each way, every day. Each voyage costs her at least $8, meaning that the clinic rescinding her take-home privileges didnt just strip her of her income it also compelled her to spend hundreds of dollars each month on transportation alone.
I want you to check me if Im actually doing something wrong and that would hurt me in my recovery, Smith said. Im very serious about my recovery. But this is not helping me in my recovery. This is not doing nothin for me, because I dont feel that Ive abused anything.
Smiths clinic records state her take-home doses were rescinded due to drinking. But they make no mention of prior alcohol use, and the doctors notes in Smiths file are nothing but positive: They describe her as cooperative, calm, pleasant and her intelligence as above-average. 
Patient is here for positive drug screen, Andrew King, the clinics medical director, wrote in a record documenting Smiths visit. She had alcohol during a celebration. She freely admits this. She is here to have the discussion about the repercussions of alcohol usage at a methadone clinic.
The doctor added: We will be consistent with clinic policy and she will be dosing daily.
In an email, King declined to comment on Smiths specific case. But he wrote that addiction care is complicated and requires the balancing of factors including co-occuring mental or physical illness, patient and community safety, and government regulations.
The treatment of substance use disorders is highly stigmatized and private. It is our policy not to discuss individual patients care, he wrote. There are many different angles to every story, which are person and context-dependent.
Pushing for flexibility
As the opioid crisis has grown worse, methadone clinics practices have attracted more scrutiny. Lawmakers, patients, and doctor groups like the American Society of Addiction Medicine have called for allowing methadone to be prescribed far more liberally. In a 2019 report, the National Academy of Medicine found that the current regulations around methadone are not supported by evidence.
Many OTP clients simply have no recourse, and nowhere to turn if they are not given take-homes or forced into counseling that doesnt meet their needs, said McGaffey, the Pew researcher. There might be a single OTP within driving distance. Those people just have to comply with rules that dont fit their lives and dont make sense for them.
Clinics are not uniformly rigid or unsympathetic: Increasingly, many offer flexible, patient-centered care that involves higher initial doses and less invasive means of supervised drug testing, like using saliva swabs instead of urine samples. Take-home medication has become far more common, thanks to the pandemic-era rule changes.
The clinics that choose to be more flexible will get a boost from a significant overhaul of federal regulations that take effect next month. Besides making more take-home doses a permanent option, the new rules allow higher initial doses. They also warn clinics against using toxicology testing punitively in effect, warning against treating patients the way Tolan Park has treated Smith.
Many patient advocates say the changes dont go nearly far enough and a select few call for abolishing the methadone clinic system entirely.
But Nora Volkow, the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, advocated for a middle ground that echoes one popular proposal from Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.): allowing the additional option of doctors to prescribe methadone directly to patients, whod pick the medication up at a pharmacy.
We need the opioid treatment programs, but it need not be so restrictive, said Volkow. Theres no reason we cannot have both: Those that see the value of attending the OTP continue, while at the same time make it easier for patients to be able to get their methadone [from] their physician, or in a pharmacy.
Even if the clinic monopoly were to be broken, its unclear how many non-clinic doctors would be willing to prescribe methadone, especially given the scrutiny that opioid prescribers face in the wake of the prescription opioid oversupply crisis of the early 2000s. Separately, many pharmacies already decline to stock buprenorphine. It stands to reason that many would also refuse to stock methadone.
This is a good opportunity to completely reexamine how treatment is offered to patients, said Parrino, the AATOD president. But offering methadone outside the context of an OTP, he said, could easily do more harm than good.
This is a classic public health risk assessment, he added. How many lives will be saved, and how many will die? I dont know the answer.
Smith at home in Detroit.Alex Hogan/STAT
Shes not even listening
Rebecca Smith is still alive.
In the half-year since her clinic radically reshaped her life, shes never been tempted to return to illicit drugs. She has fully abstained from alcohol even from champagne toasts at family gatherings. Shes complied with her clinic even as it has forced her to effectively start over as a new patient, earning take-home doses in small increments.
Smith relied on her family and her sheer determination to stay healthy. At last, the modest take-home privileges that her clinic recently restored have allowed her to return to work. In another few months, her clinic has indicated it may finally give back the freedom she previously enjoyed: One visit every two weeks, and 13 days of take-home medication in between.
But she knows others arent so lucky. Across the country, other patients have been ejected from clinics, had take-home doses rescinded, or been forced to withdraw from treatment programs because of restrictions they couldnt keep up with.
Theyre making it easier for me to relapse, in a way, because of some of the rules theyre trying to throw at you, Smith said. Im pouring my heart out to my counselor. But its like shes not even listening to me, and the doctors not even listening to me. I still feel like a second-class citizen.

About The War on Recovery
For the last year, Lev Facher has been investigating a disturbing pattern hed noticed as STATs addiction reporter: Even with overdose deaths at all-time highs, it remains very difficult for people to obtain medications used to treat opioid use disorder.
Doctors told him about myths and stigma surrounding methadone and buprenorphine, two highly effective medications that curb opioid cravings and withdrawals and vastly reduce the risk of a fatal overdose. People who wanted to quit opioids told of frustrating red tape and humiliating rules. Experts in Europe pointed out that drug deaths had radically dropped when the medications were made easier to access. A sweeping analysis of the nations addiction clinics helped him understand the financial interests shaping the industry.

(NYSE: EBS) remains committed to fighting the ongoing opioid crisis by broadening access to, and awareness of, NARCAN® Nasal Spray to help save lives in opioid overdose emergencies. In 2022, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported over 107,000 overdose deaths a number that has risen almost every year and which has continued to break annual records.1 This includes a rise in synthetic opioid overdoses mainly driven by fentanyl.1 There is an inherent risk of potential overdose, wherever opioids are present, which has tragically become the leading cause of accidental death in the U.S.2 These statistics only further underscore the need for multi-sectoral action to address and prevent opioid overdose deaths.
 One year after Emergent obtained the historic OTC U.S. FDA approval in March 2023 and seven months since retail launch in August 2023, the availability of NARCAN® Nasal Spray in pharmacies, grocery stores and online retailers has helped more people gain access to this life-saving product. Emergent and other stakeholders in the fight must continue raising awareness about the availability of products like NARCAN® Nasal Spray, reducing stigma and further improving access for all Americans. Since the OTC launch, NARCAN® Nasal Spray can be purchased at more than 32,000 mass drug, grocery, online retailers and e-commerce sites. Emergent is working with retail partners to make it easy to find and access, however each retailer ultimately determines in-store product placement.
 In 2023, Emergent distributed approximately 22 million doses (~11 million two-dose cartons) in the U.S. and Canada through public interest organizations like state and harm reduction groups and retail locations. Emergent also announced a shelf-life extension from 36 to 48 months for NARCAN® Nasal Spray in the U.S., further demonstrating its commitment to ensuring more medicine is available for the public to access.
 Were living in a time when one person dies approximately every six minutes from an accidental opioid overdose prevention and response efforts require an all-hands on deck approach toward lessening this devastating public health crisis, said Joseph Papa, president and CEO of Emergent. In my first month leading Emergent, and alongside our dedicated colleagues, we continue to advance our mission to protect the public from threats such as the opioid epidemic and am proud of our efforts to help save lives.
 Emergent is now engaging with partners who are aligned with its mission to expand access, awareness and availability, such as the National Safety Council (NSC*), working together to educate and reach businesses and employers. Specifically, Emergent sees brick and mortar stores, airlines, restaurants, hotels and schools as critical locations where NARCAN® Nasal Spray should be made available in case of an emergency, alongside AED kits.
 We know that NARCAN® Nasal Spray alone cant solve the opioid crisis and that opioid overdose reversal medication can only be useful if present and administered when a person is experiencing an overdose. When bystanders are unable to provide life-saving measures such as naloxone in nearly half of fatal overdoses, our role to help expand the reach of this medication has never been more important, said Paul Williams, senior vice president, products business, Emergent. Thats why we remain committed to increasing awareness of NARCAN® Nasal Spray availability. We also applaud the Biden Administration for their recently announced plan to address the opioid crisis, and Emergent remains prepared to support efforts to our fullest capacity and help save more lives.
 Emergent is also maintaining affordability of NARCAN® Nasal Spray and is ready to meet public need as necessary and arm individuals with an essential tool to combat against opioid overdose. As announced at the OTC retail launch last year, the Manufacturers Suggested Retail Price of NARCAN® Nasal Spray is $44.99 per two-dose carton, which is equivalent to roughly $22.50 per dose. While Emergent works with partners to help maintain access and affordability, the price of the product is set by individual retailers. Emergent set the public interest price at $41.00 per two-dose carton, building on its long-standing engagement with public interest groups to ensure naloxone is readily available to at-risk communities.
 In addition, Emergent continues to prioritize efforts to reduce the barriers to access, including addressing stigma, encouraging businesses and school districts to carry naloxone, supporting policy to ensure Health Spending Account (HSA) and Flexible Saving Account (FSA) eligibility for naloxone and working with state Medicaid agencies to provide coverage.
 NARCAN® Nasal Spray is an appropriate choice for a known or suspected opioid overdose as immediate administration, however it is not a substitute for emergency assistance. To learn more about this life-saving medicine and access resources, education and advocacy tools, visit NARCAN.com.

OLINVYK will remain available for purchase by customers, who can continue to order the product through their normal channels. The Company will continue to comply with all regulatory requirements, including post-marketing surveillance and reporting obligations. The Company is conducting a review of strategic alternatives for OLINVYK, which may include a sale, license or divestiture of OLINVYK. There can be no assurance regarding the schedule for completion of the strategic review process, that this strategic review process will result in the Company pursuing any transaction or that any transaction, if pursued, will be completed.

 </td><td>Previously, the Company reported data from two positive proof-of-concept studies demonstrating CNS target engagement for TRV045 and supporting further development in patients in neuropathic pain and epilepsy. In a target engagement POC study, TRV045 demonstrated statistically significant analgesic effect in a capsaicin-induced model of neuropathic pain. In the second study, a TMS POC study provided statistically significant evidence of CNS activity of TRV045 through day 4 as measured by resting-state EEG power spectral analysis. In a review of safety and tolerability across both studies, TRV045 was well tolerated with results generally consistent with prior first-in-human studies. There were no drug-related adverse events and no serious adverse events reported in the studies. Importantly, TRV045-treated subjects did not show any drug-related lymphopenia, bradycardia or change in blood pressure which have been reported with other S1P modulators.
 </td></tr></table><table><tr><td>
·
 </td><td>TRV045 progresses towards Phase 2 readiness with advances in formulation development and toxicology studies. The Company has successfully identified an optimized formulation of TRV045, which it believes is suitable for late-stage clinical studies and, if approved, commercialization. The modest food effect observed with the initial POC formulation has not been seen with the new formulation. TRV045 continues to demonstrate a favorable tolerability profile with the optimized formulation. In addition, the live phase of the reproductive toxicology and sub-chronic toxicology studies have been completed, with final reports expected in 2H 2024. The Company currently has an IND for TRV045 in diabetic neuropathic pain and may submit an IND application for TRV045 focused on epilepsy and seizure disorders.
 </td></tr></table><table><tr><td>
·
 </td><td>NIH-Supported Epilepsy Therapy Screening Program (ETSP) continues to study TRV045 as a potential disease-modifying agent for the prevention of seizures. Previous nonclinical studies indicate that TRV045's action on astrocytes may modify their inflammatory signaling with a net action to potentially reduce neuroinflammation and thereby may play a role in how seizures develop (epileptogenesis). The NIH continues to study TRV045 for the prevention of seizures and is currently conducting a nonclinical study in a kainic acid-induced spontaneously-recurring seizure model. Following an induction phase of status epilepticus, rats are randomized and prophylactically treated with either TRV045 15mg/kg or vehicle, dosed twice daily for seven days starting one hour after cessation of status epilepticus. The Company expects results from the studies to be available by mid-2024.
 </td></tr></table>Financial Results for Fourth Quarter 2023
For the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $16.5 million, or $1.06 per share, compared to $7.0 million, or $0.73 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year ended December 31, 2023, net loss attributable to common stockholders was $40.3 million, or $3.16 per share, compared to $53.7 million, or $7.59 per share.
Cash and cash equivalents were $33.0 million as of December 31, 2023.
About Trevena
Trevena, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative medicines for patients with CNS disorders. The Company has one approved product in the United States, OLINVYK® (oliceridine) injection, indicated in adults for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an intravenous opioid analgesic and for whom alternative treatments are inadequate. The Company's novel pipeline is based on Nobel Prize winning research and includes three differentiated investigational drug candidates: TRV045 for diabetic neuropathic pain and epilepsy, TRV250 for the acute treatment of migraine and TRV734 for maintenance treatment of opioid use disorder.
For more information, please visit www.Trevena.com
About TRV045
TRV045 is a novel, highly selective sphingosine-1-phosphate subtype 1 (S1P1) receptor modulator being developed as a potential treatment for acute and chronic neuropathic pain secondary to diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Through a collaboration with the National Institutes of Health, Trevena is also exploring TRV045 as a potential treatment for epilepsy.
S1P receptors are located throughout the body, including the central nervous system, where they are believed to play a role in modulating neurotransmission and membrane excitability.
Trevena's discovery efforts have identified a family of compounds that are highly selective for the S1P1 receptor. TRV045 reversed thermal hyperalgesia, a measure of neuropathic pain, in nonclinical models of diabetic peripheral neuropathy and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. TRV045 was not associated with lymphopenia and produced no changes in blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory function at or above pharmacologically active doses in nonclinical studies. TRV045 is an investigational product and is not yet approved by the FDA. Subjects in both studies referenced in this press release were enrolled outside of the United States, and the studies were not conducted under the Investigational New Drug Application for TRV045.
About OLINVYK® (oliceridine) injection
OLINVYK is a new chemical entity approved by the FDA in August 2020. OLINVYK contains oliceridine, an opioid, which is a Schedule II controlled substance with a high potential for abuse similar to other opioids. It is indicated in adults for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an intravenous opioid analgesic and for whom alternative treatments are inadequate. OLINVYK is available in 1 mg/1 mL and 2 mg/2 mL single-dose vials, and a 30 mg/30 mL single-patient-use vial for patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). Approved PCA doses are 0.35 mg and 0.5 mg and doses greater than 3 mg should not be administered. The cumulative daily dose should not exceed 27 mg. Please see Important Safety Information, including the BOXED WARNING, and full prescribing information at www.OLINVYK.com

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
WARNING: SERIOUS AND LIFE-THREATENING RISKS FROM USE
OF OLINVYK
Addiction, Abuse, and Misuse
Because the use of OLINVYK exposes patients and other users to the risks of opioid addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death, assess each patient's risk prior to prescribing and reassess all patients regularly for the development of these behaviors and conditions.
Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression
Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression may occur with use of OLINVYK, especially during initiation or following a dosage increase. To reduce the risk of respiratory depression, proper dosing and titration of OLINVYK are essential.
Risks From Concomitant Use With Benzodiazepines Or Other CNS Depressants
Concomitant use of opioids with benzodiazepines or other central nervous system (CNS) depressants, including alcohol, may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of OLINVYK and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate.
Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome
If opioid use is required for an extended period of time in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of NOWS, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. Ensure that management by neonatology experts will be available at delivery.
INDICATIONS AND USAGE
OLINVYK is an opioid agonist indicated in adults for the management of acute pain severe enough to require an intravenous opioid analgesic and for whom alternative treatments are inadequate.
Limitations of Use
Because of the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse with opioids, which can occur at any dosage or duration, reserve OLINVYK for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options [e.g., non-opioid analgesics or opioid combination products]:

 </td></tr></table>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
<table><tr><td>
 ·
 </td><td>
OLINVYK contains oliceridine, a Schedule II controlled substance, that exposes users to the risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse. Although the risk of addiction in any individual is unknown, it can occur in patients appropriately prescribed OLINVYK. Assess risk, counsel, and monitor all patients receiving opioids.
 </td></tr></table><table><tr><td>
·
 </td><td>
Serious, life-threatening respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even when used as recommended, especially in patients with chronic pulmonary disease, or in elderly, cachectic and debilitated patients. The risk is greatest during initiation of OLINVYK therapy, following a dose increase, or when used with other drugs that depress respiration. Proper dosing of OLINVYK is essential, especially when converting patients from another opioid product to avoid overdose. Management of respiratory depression may include close observation, supportive measures, and use of opioid antagonists, depending on the patient's clinical status.
 </td></tr></table><table><tr><td>
·
 </td><td>
Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnea (CSA) and sleep-related hypoxemia with risk increasing in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who present with CSA, consider decreasing the dose of opioid using best practices for opioid taper.
 </td></tr></table><table><tr><td>
·
 </td><td>
Profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death may result from the concomitant use of OLINVYK with benzodiazepines and/or other CNS depressants (e.g., non-benzodiazepine sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, or alcohol). Because of these risks, reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate, prescribe the lowest effective dose, and minimize the duration.
 </td></tr></table><table><tr><td>
·
 </td><td>
Use of OLINVYK for an extended period of time during pregnancy can result in withdrawal in the neonate that may be life-threatening. Observe newborns for signs of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and manage accordingly. Advise pregnant women using opioids for a prolonged period of the risk of neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and ensure that appropriate treatment will be available.
 </td></tr></table><table><tr><td>
·
 </td><td>
OLINVYK was shown to have mild QTc interval prolongation in thorough QT studies where patients were dosed up to 27 mg. Total cumulative daily doses exceeding 27 mg per day were not studied and may increase the risk for QTc interval prolongation. Therefore, the cumulative total daily dose of OLINVYK should not exceed 27 mg.
 </td></tr></table><table><tr><td>
·
 </td><td>
Increased plasma concentrations of OLINVYK may occur in patients with decreased Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 function or normal metabolizers taking moderate or strong CYP2D6 inhibitors; also in patients taking a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, in patients with decreased CYP2D6 function who are also receiving a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, or with discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer. These patients may require less frequent dosing and should be closely monitored for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals. Concomitant use of OLINVYK with CYP3A4 inducers or discontinuation of a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor can lower the expected concentration, which may decrease efficacy, and may require supplemental doses.
 </td></tr></table><table><tr><td>
·
 </td><td>
Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This differs from tolerance where increasing doses are required to maintain the desired effect. Symptoms of OIH include, but may not be limited to, increased levels of pain upon dose increase, decreased levels of pain upon dose decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of disease progression, opioid tolerance, withdrawal, or addictive behavior. If OIH is suspected, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation.
 </td></tr></table><table><tr><td>
·
 </td><td>
Cases of adrenal insufficiency have been reported with opioid use (usually greater than one month). Presentation and symptoms may be nonspecific and include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, weakness, dizziness, and low blood pressure. If confirmed, treat with physiologic replacement doses of corticosteroids and wean patient from the opioid.
 </td></tr></table><table><tr><td>
·
 </td><td>
OLINVYK may cause severe hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope in ambulatory patients. There is increased risk in patients whose ability to maintain blood pressure has already been compromised by a reduced blood volume or concurrent administration of certain CNS depressant drugs (e.g., phenothiazines or general anesthetics). Monitor these patients for signs of hypotension. In patients with circulatory shock, avoid the use of OLINVYK as it may cause vasodilation that can further reduce cardiac output and blood pressure.
 </td></tr></table><table><tr><td>
·
 </td><td>
Avoid the use of OLINVYK in patients with impaired consciousness or coma. OLINVYK should be used with caution in patients who may be susceptible to the intracranial effects of CO2 retention, such as those with evidence of increased intracranial pressure or brain tumors, as a reduction in respiratory drive and the resultant CO2 retention can further increase intracranial pressure. Monitor such patients for signs of sedation and respiratory depression, particularly when initiating therapy.
 </td></tr></table><table><tr><td>
·
 </td><td>
As with all opioids, OLINVYK may cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, and may cause increases in serum amylase. Monitor patients with biliary tract disease, including acute pancreatitis, for worsening symptoms.
 </td></tr></table><table><tr><td>
·
 </td><td>
OLINVYK may increase the frequency of seizures in patients with seizure disorders and may increase the risk of seizures in vulnerable patients. Monitor patients with a history of seizure disorders for worsened seizure control.
 </td></tr></table><table><tr><td>
·
 </td><td>
Do not abruptly discontinue OLINVYK in a patient physically dependent on opioids. Gradually taper the dosage to avoid a withdrawal syndrome and return of pain. Avoid the use of mixed agonist/antagonist (e.g., pentazocine, nalbuphine, and butorphanol) or partial agonist (e.g., buprenorphine) analgesics in patients who are receiving OLINVYK, as they may reduce the analgesic effect and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.
 </td></tr></table><table><tr><td>
·
 </td><td>
OLINVYK may impair the mental or physical abilities needed to perform potentially hazardous activities such as driving a car or operating machinery.
 </td></tr></table><table><tr><td>
·
 </td><td>
Although self-administration of opioids by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) may allow each patient to individually titrate to an acceptable level of analgesia, PCA administration has resulted in adverse outcomes and episodes of respiratory depression. Health care providers and family members monitoring patients receiving PCA analgesia should be instructed in the need for appropriate monitoring for excessive sedation, respiratory depression, or other adverse effects of opioid medications.
 </td></tr></table>ADVERSE REACTIONS
Adverse reactions are described in greater detail in the Prescribing Information.
The most common (incidence 10%) adverse reactions in Phase 3 controlled clinical trials were nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, constipation, pruritus, and hypoxia.

NIAMS",https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-AR-24-006.html,,2024-01-31T06:49:28Z,"The National Institutes of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) with other NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs), intends to publish a new Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) to solicit applications for multi-PI team-based, challenging, high impact projects to improve understanding of mechanisms of chronic pain in children and adolescents and to accelerate the development of age appropriate, patient/family centered prevention and therapeutic approaches. This research will seek to advance an integrated understanding of the biological, psychological, and social factors that contribute to pediatric chronic pain. NIH is interested in pain research in infants, children, and adolescents that includes those with intellectual and physical disabilities and/or those who experience health disparities (e.g., diverse race/ethnicity, sexual and gender minorities, socioeconomically disadvantaged, medically underserved communities, people with limited English proficiency). NIH encourages applicants to consider community-engaged research and interdisciplinary, collaborative applications to be developed in partnership with patient communities and/or community organizations where possible.  The long-term goal is to develop improved knowledge of specific pediatric pain conditions as well as pain associated with diverse diseases/disorders, to improve understanding of pain in the context of child development and to facilitate the stratification of patients with specific pain conditions and co-morbidities to accelerate chronic pain prevention and therapeutic clinical trials.
This Notice is being provided to allow potential applicants sufficient time to develop meaningful collaborations and responsive projects. 
The NOFO is expected to be published in May 2024 with an expected application due date in Fall 2024.
This NOFO will utilize the UC2 Research Project Cooperative Agreements activity code. Details of the planned NOFO are provided below. 
This effort is part of the NIH HEAL (Helping to End Addiction Long-term ®) Initiative to speed the development and implementation of scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative will bolster research across NIH to (1) improve treatment and prevention of opioid misuse and opioid use disorder and (2) enhance pain management. More information and periodic updates about the Initiative are available at: https://heal.nih.gov/.Pain in infants, children, and adolescents is common, often under-recognized, inconsistently assessed or measured, and inadequately treated. Moreover, the relationship between pain and human development and any potential effects of repeated pain experiences on future pain and physical dependency remain largely understudied. The NIH HEAL Initiative recognizes the need to support emerging research opportunities of broad scope and complexity in pain that require innovative team science approaches. This concept, as part of a suite of NIH HEAL Initiative programs, represents a major new effort to enhance pain management in pediatric populations. The goal of HEAL KIDS (Knowledge, Innovation and Discovery Studies) Pain initiative is to advance the understanding, assessment, measurement, treatment, and prevention of pain in infants, children, and adolescents, including those with disabilities and/or experiencing health disparities. The infrastructure, resources and knowledge created through this initial effort will inform ongoing and future HEAL Pain projects and facilitate the inclusion of pediatric populations across the spectrum of HEAL funded research. 
StructureThe current HEAL KIDS Pain organizational structure includes two interrelated programs, each addressing a critical area of pediatric pain research.  The Acute Pain Clinical Trials (APT) Program will focus on supporting research to improve the assessment, management, and treatment of acute pain in pediatric patients through innovative clinical trials (RFA-HD-24-011). The Chronic Pain Collaborating Teams (CPT) Program will support team science research projects to advance understanding of mechanisms of chronic pain in children and adolescents. Both programs will use a common Resource and Data Center to provide clinical trial coordinating activities and to facilitate standardization, harmonization, and collaborative data analysis (RFA-HD-24-012).  The APT and the CPT studies will integrate relevant behavioral and social influences and contexts of pain experiences. These may include but are not limited to: inclusion of social, environmental and other influences on the incidence of pain, the perception and experience of pain, and the pain reporting. The impact on families and caregivers and how that relates to pain experiences and reporting should also be considered. Integration of behavioral and social sciences in pain research is critical to fully understanding pain experiences, addressing disparities, and developing effective interventions. The overall goal of this initiative is to advance pediatric pain research by providing a framework for synergies across acute pain clinical trials and chronic pain studies and facilitate understanding of acute to chronic pain transition.
The HEAL KIDS CPT program is intended to support team-based, cross-cutting research approaches that combine clinical research, novel/cutting edge technologies, and measurement science into one platform, which will enhance our understanding of primary and secondary chronic pain processing in children and adolescents. Furthermore, it will expand our capacity to pursue challenging problems in basic biological understanding, therapeutics development and effective management of pediatric pain conditions.
Effective and safe treatments and multidisciplinary strategies are needed for moderate to severe primary chronic pain as well as refractory chronic pain in children with chronic diseases. Improving pain management, mental health, and functioning, while eliminating risk of opioid dependence, would be a major advance for pediatric patients. Importantly, successful treatment and prevention of chronic pain in children would diminish the potential for persistence of these pain conditions into adulthood. The reduced need for opioids in children and adolescents would also reduce the potential for addiction or misuse later in life. This Notice encourages teams of investigators in multiple disciplines to pursue coordinated research that integrates diverse areas of expertise under one umbrella, including but not limited to:
<ul><li>Pediatric clinical pain management</li><li>Clinical pain research</li><li>Preclinical/basic pain biology and modeling</li><li>Human psychology</li><li>Specific disease and/or pathological conditions </li><li>Artificial Intelligence</li><li>Data science </li></ul>The research teams are expected to address a significant scientific challenge that requires collaboration, synergy, knowledge integration and team interactions. Teams are encouraged to consider transformative objectives and design projects that would lead to new, innovative, and improved strategies to enhance understanding of chronic pain mechanisms at the individual level, resolve heterogeneity in patient populations in relation to the pain experience in the context of chronic diseases and conditions, and generate and validate evidence for chronic pain patient stratification.  The work should aim to test powerful tools, models and approaches to accelerate the development and translation of pain condition-specific efficacious therapeutics, and next-generation clinical management of pain. Projects should be focused on a specific pain condition, including but not limited to primary chronic pain, painful neuropathy, musculoskeletal pain, headache, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, eye pain, sickle-cell pain, post-surgical pain, cancer pain, visceral pain and gynecologic pain. Painful disorders of the orofacial region, pain co-occurring with substance-use disorders, and other conditions will also be considered. 
Examples of pediatric pain research in the context of the CPT program include, but are not limited to: 
<ul><li>Exploring mechanisms of pain in children and adolescents, including studies to define the neurobiology of pain mechanisms in children and how they change with age, investigate the sex differences in pain mechanisms, and determine the effects of pain on the developing brain. </li><li>Identifying risk factors and underlying mechanisms that may predispose to chronic pediatric pain, including identification of early childhood factors that increase pain vulnerability and affect pain management. </li><li>Developing evidence for new approaches to preventing the acute to chronic pain transition in children and adolescents.</li><li>Examining large-scale data resources and big data approaches to discover an array of multi-level factors (biologic, clinical, psychosocial, behavioral, cultural, social, structural) related to pediatric chronic pain, and new patterns and trends that may translate to novel, targeted interventions for pediatric chronic pain.</li><li>Evaluating and clinically validating age-appropriate measures, tools, and technologies for the assessment of chronic pain across the continuum of care.</li></ul> Applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with NIH program staff as plans for an application are being developed.

The Federal Circuit's decision to lift the temporary stay is a victory for the integrity of the American patent system and the safety of people relying on pulse oximetry, said Joe Kiani, Founder and CEO of Masimo. It affirms that even the largest and most powerful companies must respect the intellectual rights of American inventors and must deal with the consequences when they are caught infringing others patents.
Masimo has previously made available a study showing that Apple Watchs pulse oximetry missed over 90% of potentially life-threatening events. The Apple Watch pulse oximeter was not cleared by the United Stated Food and Drug Administration for medical use. On the other hand, the Masimo W1® health watch was recently cleared by the FDA for its indicated medical uses, including continuous pulse oximetry. Masimos pulse oximetry technology is used on over 200 million patients in hospitals a year1 and has been proven to help save babies eyesight in the neonatal ICU,2 detect critical congenital heart defects in newborns,3 and save the lives of patients in post-surgical wards who are taking opioids.4-7

Mary Harris,Mexico Is Flooded With American Guns. So the Country’s Suing Companies Like Glock and Smith & Wesson.,A $10 billion lawsuit could pave the way for new gun control tactics.,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/03/mexico-gun-lawsuit-glock-smith-wesson-beretta-colt-brady-gun-control.html,https://compote.slate.com/images/6ad605eb-4d80-4a39-9930-0dbd302d6a80.jpeg?crop=3000%2C2000%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1560,2024-03-18T14:00:00Z,"I called up Champe Barton from over at the Trace to talk about a totally new way to think about gun control. But honestly, I cant shake the very first thing he told mea fact that seems to explain just how hard it is to prevent gun violence in the first place: If you want to buy a gun in Mexico, theres one gun store, and its on an army base. Theres just one, in the entire country.
I live in a country, the United States, where there are twice as many gun stores as there are post offices, so it kind of blows my mind that just across the border things work like this. To get a gun legally in Mexico? You go through months of background checks. You apply for a temporary permit. And then you go to that military base. When the L.A. Times visited a few years back, the store sold just 38 guns a day to civilians.
And all this is even more shocking when you consider the kind of news stories Americans are used to hearing about Mexico. Since 2010, more than 200,000 people have been killed by guns there. I asked Barton to explain that disconnect.The biggest issue is just that theres thousands of American guns that are crossing the border every year into Mexico, he said. It comes out to somewhere between 360,000 to 597,000 guns a year that come over the border.
And Mexico is pissedso pissed, in fact, that its taking American gunmakers to court. With this case, the Mexican government is arguing we should think about American gunmakers the same way we think about tobacco companies or opioid distributorsas an industry that really should know better. This Mexico case was an example to me of a new, fresh attempt at getting at this problem, Barton said.
On a recent episode of What Next, we discussed this case of the Mexican government vs. American guns. Can a lawsuit do what politicians havent? Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.
Mary Harris: For the last couple of years, the Mexican government has been moving forward with this lawsuit against U.S.-based gun manufacturers. Tell me who exactly Mexico is suing here?
Champe Barton: Mexico is suing seven gun manufacturers and one gun distributor. The seven gun  manufacturers are manufacturers whose guns most frequently turn up at crime scenes in Mexico. These are some of the biggest gunmakers in America: Colt, Smith &amp; Wesson, Glock, Beretta. Huge names. Theyre suing these companies, basically alleging that they have aided and abetted gun-trafficking operations, knowingly, with the intent of profiting off of that market.
Do they have proof that these manufacturers are helping drive the flow of guns from the U.S. to Mexico?
We cant say if they have proof yet. You dont have to prove a case before you bring it. What they have proved to a judge is that their allegations are plausible. If you look at the data on gun violence in Mexico relative to gun production in the U.S., you can see a pretty clear relationship between gun homicides on Mexican soil and U.S. gun production. As gun production goes up in the U.S., gun homicides go up in Mexico, generally. The central point is that there is a clear relationship here between what goes on in the U.S. in terms of its gun market and what goes on in Mexico in terms of its gun violence problem.
How exactly does a gun move from a U.S.-based manufacturer across the border to Mexico?
The market is basically the exact same as it would be for a U.S. gun buyer, up until the point of that final transaction. So the manufacturer makes the weapon, they send it usually to a wholesaler. The wholesaler will sell it to a dealer. The dealer will then put it in their shop, and someone can come in and buy it. In the case of the guns that are trafficked, very often, whats happening is that people are going into those stores. Theyre buying the guns with the intent of trafficking them, or because theyve been tapped by someone who is working with a gun-trafficking ring to buy the gun. And then once that gun is purchased, its then smuggled south of the border, any number of ways. The exact path that the guns take after they leave the store is unclear. What is clear is that a lot of these stores wind up selling suspiciously large quantities or suspiciously frequent quantities, in suspicious areas, to the same people who they should have reason to believe are doing something thats against the law.
Is anyone asking any questions about this along the way, like, I dont know, the ATF or, like, the gun distributors themselves?
For a long time, gun manufacturers and gun wholesalers have refused to agree that they should police their distribution chains more rigorously and that that would reduce gun violence. The ATF, though, does ask questions about this. There are requirements for gun stores to notify the ATF when theres been multiple sales of a handgun, for example, to the same buyer in a short time frame. Those things do happen. But in the grand scheme of things what has to occur is that these things need to be caught in the moment. Its hard for an agency like the ATF to keep tabs of so many gun stores in the U.S. So, theyre only conducting inspections something like once every seven years of most gun dealers. Thats a pretty light regulatory regime for those stores that are intending to do dirty business.
In this lawsuit, whats Mexico asking for?
The fundamental legal claim that the Mexican government is making is that they should be entitled to financial damages and some sort of injunctive relief for the expenses that they have had to incur to try to combat this problem. And so the argument basically goes: The Mexican government has had to beef up its police forces and its military forces. Theres been extraordinary costs in their judicial system. And all of those costs are associated with this problem. And their claim is that problem is caused by the gunmakers intentional profiteering off of this trafficking network.
A lot of people compare this lawsuit to tobacco litigation. How does that litigation compare with whats happening here?
The general philosophy behind a lot of those lawsuits was that you had an industry that was selling a product that was causing harm to the general public, and that industry was not doing everything within its power, and not even doing the things that it knew it could do, to limit the harm that its product caused the public. If you think about it in those terms, its very similar to what is being alleged of the gunmakers.
To me, it actually seems so similar to the opioid litigation that moved forward recently because the allegations in some of that litigation were basically that drugmakers had data showing opioids were streaming into certain areas of the country in really concerning ways, and they just didnt investigate what was going on.
There was a time in the U.S. in which that comparison was almost perfect, because it used to be that when a firearm was traced, the ATF needed to pick up a phone and dial the manufacturer and inform them, Hey, this gun with this serial number turned up at a crime scene. Who did you sell it to? And then they would have to say, Oh, weve sold it to this wholesaler, and they would go on down the chain like that. Whats happened since around 2000 is that the ATF essentially set up servers in the database of manufacturers and wholesalers, and they use those servers to ping the acquisition and disposition logs at these companies so that they dont have to make a phone call. Now, I dont know specifically what the rules are about the companies who are agreeing to these policies actually seeing the pings that theyre getting, for example, for guns that have turned up. Like, it may be something that theyre not allowed to look at. I just dont. But I do know that data is available. Its there. And I cannot imagine that if they wanted to look at it, that the ATF would refuse to allow them to look at it.
With opioids, Ithink that the drug manufacturers were required to intervene in some way when they saw increased use like this. But it sounds like with the guns its a little more fuzzy.
Theres certainly no requirement in the U.S. for the gunmakers to do anything of the sort. They do not have to police their distribution. The attitude of the industry has always been hands off. The law enforcement side of this equation is the ATFs job. Its not for us to do anything about.So if the ATF tells us to stop selling somewhere, well stop selling. But if the ATF hasnt told us theres a problem, were not going to find one and act on our own volition here.
I want to talk about the people who brought this gun case. The case was obviously brought by Mexico against the U.S manufacturers, but theyre being helped by American lawyers, right?
Jon Lowy used to be lead counsel at Brady, the prominent gun violence prevention group. But Jon Lowy has been doing this sort of litigation for decades. He is currently involved in other lawsuits that are making very similar allegations to the government of Mexico. The city of Gary, Indiana, has a suit right now, and that suits been going on for 20-some odd years. And he recently split off from Brady and founded his own gun violence prevention group called Global Action on Gun Violence.
Jon Lowy is an interesting character to me because when he was at the Brady Center, he wrote this report, and this was way back in 2009, talking about the ways that gun manufacturing in the U.S. is connected to crime in Mexico. And at the time, one of the real focuses of this report was weak gun laws in the U.S.basically saying weak gun laws are making it so that guns from the U.S. are going to Mexico. So why didnt he want to fix the weak American laws? Like, this lawsuit isnt going after the laws. Its going after the gun manufacturers.
I dont think that those two things are mutually exclusive, first of all. Second of all, there is a calculus that anybody who is interested in addressing this problem has to make, and that calculus is about what action is going to most efficiently deal with this problem and which has the potential for the greatest reduction of harm, basically. It has been an obviousso obvious it almost doesnt need sayingthing in the U.S. that gun violence prevention legislation is just a total nonstarter politically. Theres just such a model from these other corporate accountability movements that weve been discussingthe opioid litigation, the tobacco litigation, the automotive litigationthat shows that there is an avenue for justice through the courts, generally, when corporations products are associated with such widespread harm. And the calculus that has been made by a lot of these people who are involved in these lawsuits is that this is a quicker, more efficient, and potentially more effective way to reduce gun violence.
Lets talk about some challenges this lawsuit is going to face as it moves through the courts. The first is whether this lawsuit can move forward at all. Why wouldnt this lawsuit be able to move forward? What would keep it out of a courtroom?
The lawsuit was dismissed once in 2022 on account of this federal law known as the Protection of Lawful Commerce and Arms Act, which was passed in the early aughts as a way to get rid of a bunch of lawsuits that were making very similar allegations to the Mexican government. This law was passed to essentially get rid of those lawsuits, to say that you cannot sue a gunmaker as a result of harms caused by people who have committed crimes with their weapons.
It seems like a pretty nicepiece of legislation if youre a gun manufacturer.
It has been a very nice piece of legislation for them, and it has stifled the kind of legal maturation that I was describing earlier. The litigation against the opioid manufacturers, to come back to that comparison, didnt start in 2015. It didnt start when opioid deaths were all over the news. It started in the late 1990s. It started at the same time that they were trying to sue gunmakers. And most of those just werent successful, because the legal theories that they were working with hadnt been worked out yet; there was compelling arguments to dismiss these cases. And over time, people kept trying to bring these lawsuits because the problem persisted. And eventually they settled on a legal theory that allowed those suits to proceed.
The Mexican government has attempted a novel legal strategy to bring this case forward. And not a lot of plaintiffs within the U.S. have had an opportunity to make those same attempts. So, that law has kept industry accountability off the books for the past two decades almost.
Didnt the Sandy Hook parents sue the gun manufacturers? What made their case different?
Yes, they did. The Protection of Lawful Commerce and Arms Act has a few exceptions: If a gunmaker sells a defective product, for example, then then they can be sued; if a gunmaker breaches a contract, they can be sued. The exception that gets targeted the most for plaintiffs who are trying to hold gunmakers accountable for gun violence and for negligent distribution practices is this exception known as the predicate exception, which allows for lawsuits when theyre brought based on harm caused by the violation of a state or federal statute that is applicable to the sale or marketing of firearms. Basically what that means is that if youre going to sue a gunmaker, you have to sue them saying that you were harmed because they violated a law thats specifically related to the sale or marketing of firearms.
And so what the Sandy Hook parents did was they sued, saying that they were harmed by the gunmakers violation of an unfair trade practices law in Connecticut. And the judge agreed that that law applied to the sale or marketing of firearms.

How is the Mexican government arguing that their case should be allowed to proceed?
Originally the Mexican government tried to argue that the PLCAA should just not apply at all because theyre a foreign government, and it shouldnt apply to foreign governments. That argument was dismissed by this federal district court in Massachusetts in 2022. They appealed, and in January of this year, they were successful on that appeal in arguing not that PLCAA should not apply but that they do fit one of PLCAAs exceptions, namely the same exception that the Sandy Hook families targeted. And the reason for that is that the Mexican government has alleged that the gunmakers have violated laws having to do with straw purchasing, laws having to do with exporting firearms without a license, laws having to do with selling firearms without a license. And theyve basically said that these gunmakers were in some way conspirators with stores along the border that have participated in these trafficking rings
If this lawsuit does move forward, I dont think its a slam dunk. One argument the industry makes here is, Listen, Mexico needs to get its own house in order. Control your gangs. The problem is not the guns from us. The problem is the people bringing the guns in. What do you make of that argument?

 </li></ol>
All this stuff needs to be shaken out at trial. And if it goes to trial and the gunmakers are able to prove that they were not, indeed, intentionally and knowingly, facilitating the trafficking of weapons across the border, then, sure, thats the reality that were left with. But what the Mexican government says it will be able to prove is that these gunmakers arent just turning a blind eye. The guns are being trafficked over the border because thats what the gunmakers want, because its a very lucrative segment of their industry. That would certainly seem to me to be a slam dunk in the sense that you would have, for the first time, a court decide that the distribution practices of the gun industry are directly responsible for the harms caused by gun violence down the line. And that would really be a profound ruling.
If this strategy by the Mexican government holds, and its not overturned by the Supreme Court, then you have an opportunity for domestic plaintiffs to make a similar argument. And now its a question of whether or not they could prove it; we dont know. The other important thing to note is that while this Mexican governments case has gone on, potential U.S plaintiffs have not just been sitting idly by. Several cities across the country have passed laws over the past three years to amend their state public nuisance statutes or to add new laws on the books that make explicit their connection to the sale or marketing of firearms. And those laws were put on the books with the intent of easing the route in through this predicate exception to the PLCAA.",,Slate Magazine,High-Quality News Sources,A $10 billion lawsuit could pave the way for new gun control tactics.,lawsuit and settlement,0.5294013023376465

About ZYNRELEF for Postoperative Pain
ZYNRELEF is the first and only dual-acting local anesthetic that delivers a fixed-dose combination of the local anesthetic bupivacaine and a low dose of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug meloxicam. ZYNRELEF is the first and only extended-release local anesthetic to demonstrate in Phase 3 studies significantly reduced pain and significantly increased proportion of patients requiring no opioids through the first 72 hours following surgery compared to bupivacaine solution, the current standard-of-care local anesthetic for postoperative pain control. ZYNRELEF was initially approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the ""FDA"") in May 2021 for use in adults for soft tissue or periarticular instillation to produce postsurgical analgesia for up to 72 hours after bunionectomy, open inguinal herniorrhaphy and total knee arthroplasty. In December 2021, the FDA approved an expansion of ZYNRELEF's indication to include foot and ankle, small-to-medium open abdominal, and lower extremity total joint arthroplasty surgical procedures. On January 23, 2024, the FDA approved ZYNRELEF for soft tissue and orthopedic surgical procedures including foot and ankle, and other procedures in which direct exposure to articular cartilage is avoided. Safety and efficacy have not been established in highly vascular surgeries, such as intrathoracic, large multilevel spinal, and head and neck procedures. ZYNRELEF was granted a marketing authorization by the European Commission in September 2020 and by the United Kingdom Regulatory Authority in January 2021. In August 2023, we cancelled the ZYNRELEF U.K. marketing authorization and, in October 2023, we cancelled the ZYNRELEF European Union (EU) marketing authorization, as we do not plan to commercially launch ZYNRELEF in the U.K. or the EU.

About SUSTOL for CINV Prevention
SUSTOL is indicated in combination with other antiemetics in adults for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) or anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) combination chemotherapy regimens. SUSTOL is an extended-release, injectable 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 RA that utilizes Heron's Biochronomer® drug delivery technology to maintain therapeutic levels of granisetron for 5 days. The SUSTOL global Phase 3 development program was comprised of two, large, guideline-based clinical studies that evaluated SUSTOL's efficacy and safety in more than 2,000 patients with cancer.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement our financial results presented on a GAAP basis, we have included information about certain non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed with our results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provide analysts, investors, lenders, and other third parties with insights into how we evaluate normal operational activities, including our ability to generate cash from operations, on a comparable year-over-year basis and manage our budgeting and forecasting.
In our quarterly and annual reports, earnings press releases and conference calls, we may discuss the following financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis.
Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude interest expense, interest income, the benefit from or provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and other adjustments to reflect changes that occur in our business but do not represent ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA, as used by us, may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.
There are several limitations related to the use of adjusted EBITDA rather than net income or loss, which is the nearest GAAP equivalent, such as:
<ul><li>adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization, and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated or amortized may have to be replaced in the future, the cash requirements for which are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA;</li><li>we exclude stock-based compensation expense from adjusted EBITDA although: (i) it has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy; and (ii) if we did not pay out a portion of our compensation in the form of stock-based compensation, the cash salary expense included in operating expenses would be higher, which would affect our cash position;</li><li>adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs;</li><li>adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the benefit from or provision for income taxes or the cash requirements to pay taxes;</li><li>adjusted EBITDA does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;</li><li>we exclude restructuring expenses from adjusted EBITDA. Restructuring expenses primarily include employee severance and contract termination costs that are not related to acquisitions. The amount and/or frequency of these restructuring expenses are not part of our underlying business;</li></ul>Adjusted Operating Expenses
Adjusted operating expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents GAAP operating expenses adjusted to exclude stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, and other adjustments to reflect changes that occur in our business but do not represent ongoing operations.
Reconciliations of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating expenses to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in this press release.
The Company has not provided a reconciliation of its full-year 2024 guidance for adjusted EBITDA or adjusted operating expenses to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures, in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K, because the Company is unable to predict, without unreasonable efforts, the timing and amount of items that would be included in such a reconciliation, including, but not limited to, stock-based compensation expense, acquisition related expense and litigation settlements. These items are uncertain and depend on various factors that are outside of the Company's control or cannot be reasonably predicted. While the Company is unable to address the probable significance of these items, they could have a material impact on GAAP net income and operating expenses for the guidance period.
Forward-looking Statements
This news release contains ""forward-looking statements"" as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Heron cautions readers that forward-looking statements are based on management's expectations and assumptions as of the date of this news release and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include, among others, statements we make regarding the potential market opportunities for ZYNRELEF, APONVIE, CINVANTI and SUSTOL; revenue, adjusted EBITDA and other financial guidance provided by the Company; the results of the commercial launch of APONVIE; the potential additional market opportunity for the expanded U.S. label for ZYNRELEF; the timing of the Company's development of the VAN program and receipt of required regulatory approvals; our ability to establish and maintain successful commercial arrangements like our co-promotion agreement CrossLink Life Sciences; the outcome of the Company's pending ANDA litigation; whether the Company is required to write-off any additional inventory in the future; the expected future balances of Heron's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments; the expected duration over which Heron's cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments balances will fund its operations and the risk that future equity financings may be needed; any inability or delay in achieving profitability. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are set forth in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and any subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and in our other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including under the caption ""Risk Factors.""

Meg Wingerter,Denver Health’s opioid monitoring program snared in controversy over past links to Purdue Pharma,"A drug research program at Denver Health has landed in the center of a national controversy, with supporters saying it does vital work to understand the landscape of addiction and opponents accusing the program’s staff of helping opioid makers shift blame from their products.",https://www.denverpost.com/2024/01/20/radars-opioid-monitoring-denver-health-purdue-pharama/,https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/E_Cigarettes_FDA_41515.jpg?w=1024&h=682,2024-01-20T13:00:16Z,"A drug research program at Denver Health has landed in the center of a national controversy, with supporters saying it does vital work to understand the landscape of addiction and opponents accusing the program’s staff of helping opioid makers shift blame from their products.
In October, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration posted an announcement and solicited public feedback for its plans to study whether a survey of people in drug treatment programs produced useful data, and how much of a burden it is for treatment centers to administer the survey.
The agency was referring to data collected by the Researched Abuse, Diversion and Addiction-Related Surveillance program, which is known as RADARS and is based at Denver Health.
The notice touched off a backlash, with advocacy groups including Public Citizen and Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, as well as some individuals who lost family members to overdoses, urging the FDA not to work with RADARS.
They alleged the organization is too close to Purdue Pharma, which experts widely blame for sparking the opioid crisis through its misleading marketing of OxyContin as an almost risk-free solution for people in pain.
Purdue created RADARS in 2001 to satisfy the FDA and U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency that it was tracking misuse of its products and cases where people in health care diverted the pills for their own use or to sell on the illicit market. The company sold the system to Denver Health four years later for $100 upfront and $10 million in subscriptions to its data reports. Other companies that make opioids and drugs that people can misuse also subscribe to the RADARS reports.
Dr. Andrew Kolodny, president of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, said that, even after the move to Denver Health, RADARS staff argued against stricter limitations on prescription opioids before multiple state legislatures and the FDA, and lent their names to articles authored by employees of Purdue and other opioid makers.
Much of the information that concerns advocates came from a 2019 lawsuit by Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser alleging Purdue used RADARS to advance its own interests, he said.
“Its primary role was helping the opioid industry,” Kolodny said of RADARS.
But RADARS executive director Dr. Richard Dart said the criticism is off-base. The FDA requires companies that make controlled substances to provide information about how their products are used and misused, and the companies pay RADARS to gather the data and package it for them. But the organization is independent and has an important role in protecting public safety, he said.
Dart said RADARS didn’t hesitate to sound the alarm when deaths from prescription opioids rose during the first decade of the millennium. Drugmakers don’t have access to the raw data, so they can’t manipulate it to make their products look safer, and their contract forbids them from using RADARS data in advertising, he said.
“We have to be squeaky clean” or the FDA would refuse to accept the data, he said.
The FDA released a statement Friday saying it was considering all comments on its announcement about studying the RADARS survey data. Agencies periodically assess surveys they use to ensure that respondents understand the questions and give similar answers even if asked in a slightly different way.
“We will continue to advance solutions that encourage appropriate prescribing, promote innovation in pain management, prioritize overdose prevention, reduce opioid and other substance use disorders and champion effective treatment and support for those with substance use disorder,” the statement said.
The Colorado attorney general’s lawsuit against Purdue seeks compensation for the damage done by its OxyContin marketing. The AG’s team alleges RADARS and its staff assisted Purdue and other opioid makers in lobbying against restrictions and in pushing for states to prioritize versions of painkillers that are harder to crush and snort.
Evidence is mixed on whether so-called abuse-deterrent formulations work, with some studies finding lower risk of overdose, while others suggested people found other ways to misuse the pills or switched to other products.
“After its transfer to the Denver Health and Hospital Authority, Purdue and the individual defendants continued through at least 2018 to use RADARS to lobby for legislation and other policies supporting Purdues abuse-deterrent opioids in Colorado and around the country,” the lawsuit said.
The attorney general’s office declined to comment on the allegations, because the lawsuit against Purdue is still pending.
RADARS’ reports include information collected from calls to poison centers; law enforcement data on drug diversion arrests; a national survey of about 60,000 members of the general public; a website that collects information on the cost and availability of different drugs from street dealers; and the survey of people seeking drug treatment about their history with substances.
RADARS was a leader in identifying the prescription drug overdose crisis and spotting that heroin was beginning to displace pills as the top killer around 2011, before being displaced itself by fentanyl, said Dart, the program’s director.
The data suggests that the drug misuse problem goes deeper than any particular product, as many people answering the surveys admit they know they’re risking their lives with fentanyl, but are willing to do so as a way of coping with emotional struggles, he said.
“It’s unfathomable why our society has this need to misuse and abuse drugs,” Dart said. “I dont think it’s party-time stuff.”

"RYAN J. FOLEY, CARLA K. JOHNSON and SHELBY LUM",Dozens of deaths reveal risks of injecting sedatives into people restrained by police,Demetrio Jackson was desperate for medical help when the paramedics arrived.,https://www.startribune.com/dozens-of-deaths-reveal-risks-of-injecting-sedatives-into-people-restrained-by-police/600361820/,https://www.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1713369823,2024-04-26T10:17:01Z,"Demetrio Jackson was desperate for medical help when the paramedics arrived.
The 43-year-old was surrounded by police who arrested him after responding to a trespassing call in a Wisconsin parking lot. Officers had shocked him with a Taser and pinned him as he pleaded that he couldn't breathe. Now he sat on the ground with hands cuffed behind his back and took in oxygen through a mask.
Then, officers moved Jackson to his side so a medic could inject him with a potent knockout drug.
''It's just going to calm you down,'' an officer assured Jackson. Within minutes, Jackson's heart stopped. He never regained consciousness and died two weeks later.
Jackson's 2021 death illustrates an often-hidden way fatal U.S. police encounters end: not with the firing of an officer's gun but with the silent use of a medical syringe.
The practice of giving sedatives to people detained by police has spread quietly across the nation over the last 15 years, built on questionable science and backed by police-aligned experts, an investigation led by The Associated Press has found. Based on thousands of pages of law enforcement and medical records and videos of dozens of incidents, the investigation shows how a strategy intended to reduce violence and save lives has resulted in some avoidable deaths.
At least 94 people died after they were given sedatives and restrained by police from 2012 through 2021, according to findings by the AP in collaboration with FRONTLINE (PBS) and the Howard Centers for Investigative Journalism. That's nearly 10% of the more than 1,000 deaths identified during the investigation of people subdued by police in ways that are not supposed to be fatal. About half of the 94 who died were Black, including Jackson.
Behind the racial disparity is a disputed medical condition called excited delirium, which fueled the rise of sedation outside hospitals. Critics say its purported symptoms, including ''superhuman strength'' and high pain tolerance, play into racist stereotypes about Black people and lead to biased decisions about who needs sedation.
The use of sedatives in half these incidents has never been reported, as scrutiny typically focuses on the actions of police, not medics. Elijah McClain's 2019 death in Aurora, Colorado, was a rare exception: Two paramedics were convicted of giving McClain an overdose of ketamine, the same drug given to Jackson. One was sentenced last month to five years in prison and the second faces sentencing Friday.
It was impossible to determine the role sedatives may have played in each of the 94 deaths, which often involved the use of other potentially dangerous force on people who had taken drugs or consumed alcohol. Medical experts told the AP their impact could be negligible in people who were already dying; the final straw that triggered heart or breathing failure in the medically distressed; or the main cause of death when given in the wrong circumstances or mishandled.
While sedatives were mentioned as a cause or contributing factor in a dozen official death rulings, authorities often didn't even investigate whether injections were appropriate. Medical officials have traditionally viewed them as mostly benign treatments. Now some say they may be playing a bigger role than previously understood and deserve more scrutiny.
Time and time again, the AP found, agitated people who were held by police facedown, often handcuffed and with officers pushing on their backs, struggled to breathe and tried to get free. Citing combativeness, paramedics administered sedatives, further slowing their breathing. Cardiac and respiratory arrest often occurred within minutes.
Paramedics drugged some people who were not a threat to themselves or others, violating treatment guidelines. Medics often didn't know whether other drugs or alcohol were in people's systems, although some combinations cause serious side effects.
Police officers sometimes improperly encouraged paramedics to give shots to suspects they were detaining.
Responders occasionally joked about the medications' power to knock their subjects out. ''Night, night'' is heard on videos before deaths in California, Tennessee and Florida.
Emergency medical workers, ""if they aren't careful, can simply become an extension of the police's handcuffs, of their weapons, of their nightsticks,'' said Claire Zagorski, a paramedic and an addiction researcher at the University of Texas at Austin.
Supporters say sedatives enable rapid treatment for drug-related behavioral emergencies and psychotic episodes, protect front-line responders from violence and are safely administered thousands of times annually to get people with life-threatening conditions to hospitals. Critics say forced sedation should be strictly limited or banned, arguing the medications, given without consent, are too risky to be administered during police encounters.
Ohio State University professor Dr. Mark DeBard was an important early proponent of sedation, believing it could be used in rare cases when officers encountered extremely agitated people who needed rapid medical treatment. Today, he said he's frustrated officers still sometimes use excessive force instead of treating those incidents as medical emergencies. He's also surprised paramedics have given unnecessary injections by overdiagnosing excited delirium.
Others say the premise was flawed, with sedatives and police restraint creating a dangerous mix. The deaths have left a trail of grieving relatives from coast to coast.
''They're running around on the streets administering these heavy-duty medications that could be lethal,'' said Honey Gutzalenko, a nurse whose husband died after he was injected with midazolam in 2021 while restrained by police near San Francisco. ''It's just not right.''
'I'M BEGGING YOU TO STOP'
Jackson was standing on a truck outside a radio station on the border of the small Wisconsin cities of Eau Claire and Altoona. An employee called 911 before dawn on Oct. 8, 2021, hoping officers could shoo away a stranger who ''doesn't seem to be a threat, but not normal either.''
Police video and hundreds of pages of law enforcement and medical records show how the incident escalated.
An Altoona police officer met Jackson in the parking lot. Jackson appeared uneasy and paranoid, looking around and talking softly. He had taken methamphetamine, which a psychiatrist said he used to self-medicate for schizophrenia. He'd been in and out of jail and living on the streets, with frequent visits to the emergency room seeking a place to rest.
The officer, joined by a second Altoona officer and a sheriff's deputy, told him he could leave if he gave his name. Jackson refused.
Police identified him through his tattoos, learning he was on probation for meth possession. They noticed the truck had minor damage and decided to arrest him.
Jackson took off running. The officers chased Jackson, who stopped seconds later and staggered toward the first officer. Body-camera video shows she fired her Taser, its darts striking Jackson in the stomach and thigh. He screamed after the electrical shock and collapsed.
When officers couldn't handcuff Jackson, she fired additional darts, striking Jackson in the back as he lay on the ground. Officers from the Eau Claire Police Department forced Jackson onto his stomach to be handcuffed and restrained him in what's known as the prone position.
''I'm begging you to stop,'' Jackson said. ''I can't breathe.''
After a couple of minutes, officers moved him to his side and then sat him up, trying to improve his breathing.
An officer wondered aloud whether Jackson had ''excited delirium'' and asked a colleague if paramedics were ''going to stand around and do nothing.'' He voiced approval when one arrived with ketamine, adding Jackson would not like it ''when he gets poked.''
The Eau Claire Fire Department's excited delirium protocol advises, ''Rapid sedation is the key to de-escalation!!!!!'' The medic measured 400 milligrams after estimating the 6-foot-tall Jackson weighed 175 pounds, enough to immobilize someone within minutes. He injected the medicine into Jackson's buttocks.
Five medical experts who reviewed the case for AP said Jackson's behavior did not appear to be dangerous enough to justify the intervention.
''I don't believe he was a candidate for ketamine,'' said Connecticut paramedic Peter Canning, who said he supports sedating truly violent patients because they stop fighting and are sleeping by the time they get to the hospital.
Minutes later, Jackson stopped breathing on the way to Sacred Heart Hospital. He'd suffered cardiac arrest and, after he was resuscitated, had no brain function.
Jackson's mother, Rita Gowens, collapsed while shopping at an Indiana Walmart when she learned her oldest son was hospitalized and not expected to survive.
Gowens rushed to the hospital 500 miles away, where she was told he'd been injected with ketamine. She searched online and was stunned to read it's used to tranquilize horses.
Gowens spoke to Jackson, held his hand and hoped for a miracle. She eventually agreed to remove him from a ventilator after his condition didn't improve, singing into his ear as he took his final breaths: ''You've never lost a battle, and I know, I know, you never will.''
She still has nightmares about how police and medics treated her son, whom she recalls as a happy boy with chunky cheeks that inspired the nickname ''Meatball.'' There are few days when she doesn't ask, ''Why did they give him an animal tranquilizer?''
KETAMINE MOVES TO THE STREETS
The practice of using ketamine to subdue people outside hospitals began in 2004 when a disturbed man scaled a fence, cut himself with a broken bottle and paced along a narrow strip of concrete on a Minneapolis highway bridge.
The man was in danger of falling into traffic below when officers reached through the fence and grabbed him.
Dr. John Hick, who worked with first responders, heard the emergency radio chatter while driving and rushed to the scene with an idea. Hick gave the man two shots of ketamine, started an IV and kept him breathing with an air mask.
The man stopped struggling, and responders lowered him to safety.
Paramedics had occasionally used other sedatives to calm combative people since the 1980s. Hick and his Hennepin County Medical Center colleague Dr. Jeffrey Ho believed ketamine worked faster and had fewer side effects, showing promise to avert fatal police encounters.
Ho was a leading researcher on Taser safety and an expert witness for the company in wrongful death lawsuits. In a 2007 deposition in one such case, he argued for a potentially ''life-saving tactic'' of having sedative injections quickly follow Taser shocks, saying the combination could shorten struggles that, if prolonged, might end in death.
Some doctors at his public hospital in Minneapolis were using ''something called ketamine, which is an analog to LSD,'' he said. ''It's sort of an animal tranquilizer.''
The drug became more common outside the hospital in 2008 when Hennepin County paramedics were given permission to use it.
An American College of Emergency Physicians panel that included Ho said in 2009 that ketamine had shown ''excellent results and safety'' while acknowledging no research proved it would save lives.
In time, its use became standard from Las Vegas to Columbus, Ohio, to Palm Beach County, Florida. The earliest death involving ketamine documented in AP's investigation came in 2015, when 34-year-old Juan Carrizales was injected after struggling with police in the Dallas suburb of Garland, Texas.
Shortly after ketamine became authorized for such use in Arizona in 2017, deputies who were restraining David Cutler facedown in handcuffs in the scorching desert asked a paramedic to sedate him.
The medic testified he was surprised when Cutler stopped breathing, although the dose was larger than recommended for someone weighing 132 pounds. He said he had been trained that ketamine didn't impact respiration. Cutler's death was ruled an accident due to heat exposure and LSD though that was disputed by experts hired by Cutler's family, who said heat stroke along with ketamine caused his death.
In Minneapolis, an oversight agency found the use of ketamine during police calls rose dramatically from 2012 through 2017 and body-camera video showed instances of officers appearing to pressure paramedics to use ketamine and joking about its power. The department told officers they could never ''suggest or demand'' the use of sedation.
Facing criticism, Hennepin Healthcare halted a study examining the effectiveness of ketamine on agitated patients. The Food and Drug Administration later found the research failed to protect vulnerable, intoxicated people who had not given consent.
By 2021, the American College of Emergency Physicians warned ketamine impacted breathing and the heart more than previously believed.
''Ketamine is not as benign as we might have hoped it to be,'' a co-author of the new position, Dr. Jeffrey Goodloe, said on the group's podcast in 2022.
He said the practice of giving large doses of ketamine, sometimes too much for smaller patients, had spread nationwide as agencies copied each other's protocols with little independent review.
But the AP's findings show risks of sedation go beyond ketamine, which was used in at least 19 cases.
Roughly half of the 94 deaths documented by the AP came after the use of midazolam, which has long been known to heighten the risk of respiratory depression. Many came during police encounters in California, where ketamine is not widely used. Midazolam, a common pre-surgery drug known by the brand name Versed, is also part of a three-drug cocktail used in some states to execute prisoners.
Other cases involved a range of other drugs, including the antipsychotic medications haloperidol and ziprasidone, which can cause irregular heartbeats.
The need for monitoring side effects is often laid out for paramedics in written guidelines, many of which are based on the disputed belief that excited delirium can cause sudden death.
THE HISTORY OF 'EXCITED DELIRIUM'
The theory of excited delirium was troubling from the start.
In the 1980s, with cocaine use soaring, Dr. Charles Wetli, a Miami forensic pathologist, coined the term to explain a handful of deaths of violent cocaine users, many of whom had been restrained by police. Wetli, who died in 2020, also blamed excited delirium for the mysterious deaths of more than a dozen Black women. He said cocaine and sexual activity triggered the fatal condition.
The women's deaths eventually were attributed to a serial killer. Wetli's theory survived. And over time, symptoms described by Wetli and others ''superhuman strength,'' animal-like noises and high pain tolerance became disproportionately assigned to Black people. The terms spread to police and emergency medical services to describe certain agitated people and explain sudden deaths.
By the mid-2000s, police were encountering more drug users and mentally ill people as stimulant use increased and psychiatric hospitals closed. Departments adopted Tasers as a less-lethal alternative to firearms, but there was a problem hundreds died after being jolted.
Supporters of Wetli's research, including the medical examiner in Miami-Dade County, ruled again and again that excited delirium was the cause of these deaths, not the effects of the weapons and other physical force. Executives at Taser's manufacturer agreed, promoting excited delirium to medical examiners around the country and retaining experts who explained the concept to juries in wrongful death lawsuits.
In 2006, a grand jury that investigated Taser-related deaths in Miami-Dade recommended an untested treatment that it said could save people before they died from excited delirium: squirting midazolam up their noses to cause ''almost immediate sedation.'' Its report acknowledged they ''may experience difficulty in breathing.'' Miami-Dade paramedics adopted this treatment.
But key medical groups didn't recognize excited delirium, and activists were calling for limits on Taser use. What happened next would help promote sedation alongside Tasers as tools to gain control.
In 2008, the biggest names in excited delirium research gathered at a Las Vegas hotel for a three-day meeting organized by a group with ties to Taser's manufacturer.
''A lot of talk took place on chemical sedation because the cops didn't know what to do with these people,'' recalled John Peters, president of the Institute for the Prevention of In-Custody Deaths, which sponsored the meeting. ''Jeff Ho had done some work up in Minnesota. He said, 'Look. I've been using ketamine. It knocks them out quicker.'''
The timing was fortuitous: The American College of Emergency Physicians would soon form a task force to study excited delirium and how police and medics should respond.
The 19-member panel included Ho, who became Taser's medical director under an arrangement in which the company paid part of his hospital salary; Dr. Donald Dawes, a Taser research consultant; and University of Miami researcher Deborah Mash, who testified for Taser about several deaths she blamed on excited delirium. At least two other panelists were routinely retained by officers and their departments as expert witnesses.
The panel's 2009 paper disclosed none of these relationships. It found excited delirium was real, could result in death regardless of whether someone was shocked with a Taser and called for ''aggressive chemical sedation'' to treat the symptoms.
DeBard, the Ohio doctor who chaired the panel, told AP he recruited relevant experts to join and that disclosure of conflicts wasn't required by the ER doctors group then. He said Taser didn't influence the outcome, which reflected the panel's consensus. Mash said she had no conflict because Taser didn't fund her research. Dawes declined an interview request. Ho didn't return messages.
Taser rebranded itself in 2017 as Axon. A spokesperson for the company declined interview requests and did not respond to written questions.
Dr. Brooks Walsh, an emergency physician in Connecticut who was not on the panel, said the 2009 paper reinforced racial bias as it formalized ''loaded terms'' used to describe excited delirium, influencing how the diagnosis would be applied.
Ho and other Taser- and police-aligned experts joined a federally sponsored panel in 2011 that built on the work, recommending four actions on a checklist for officers and paramedics: Identify excited delirium symptoms; control (with a Taser if necessary); sedate; and transport to a hospital.
No test measures for excited delirium, so paramedics faced a judgment call: Which patients were so agitated, strong, impervious to pain and dangerous that they needed to be sedated?
DeBard said the symptoms were based on medical observations, not race. ''If you've got somebody that's delirious, irrational, aggressive, hyperactive, running around naked, I mean, it's really pretty easy"" to recognize, he said.
Yet, over time, prominent medical groups and some experts pointed to overuse of sedation during police encounters and a disproportionate impact on Black people. Even supporters of the practice have acknowledged that the wrong patients at times have been injected.
The deaths of Black men in police custody, including the 2020 killing of George Floyd, put pressure on the medical community to re-examine excited delirium. The ER doctors group in 2023 withdrew approval of the 2009 paper and said excited delirium shouldn't be used in court testimony. Some doctors called that decision political and note the group still recognizes a similar condition hyperactive delirium with severe agitation that can be treated with sedation. But today no major medical association legitimizes excited delirium.
'CONVENIENT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT'
In more than a dozen cases reviewed by AP, police asked for or suggested the use of sedatives, calling into question whether medics were working for law enforcement or in patients' interests. Officers often suggested their detainees had excited delirium.
University of California, Berkeley, law and bioethics professor Osagie Obasogie, who has studied excited delirium and sedation, said officers should be banned from influencing medical care.
''We need to be sure that folks are treated in a way that meets their medical needs and not simply given a chemical restraint because it's convenient for law enforcement,'' he said.
Officers are told not to dictate medical treatment but ''some knuckleheads'' have done otherwise, said Peters, whose group hosted the 2008 Las Vegas meeting that focused on excited delirium.
Paramedics say they make medical decisions independently from police, following guidelines that call for sedating people who may be dangerous. But in several cases AP found, people were injected though they had calmed down or even passed out after struggles with police.
Ivan Gutzalenko, a 47-year-old father, was struggling to breathe as two officers restrained him in Richmond, California. Gutzalenko told the officers they were hurting him, and bucked to try to get one off his back.
A paramedic viewed Gutzalenko's action as aggression, and went to his ambulance to get a 5-milligram dose of midazolam. When he returned three minutes later, Gutzalenko lay motionless. ''He's faking like he's unconscious,'' an officer said.
The medic plunged the needle into his bicep. Gutzalenko's heart stopped. He was declared dead at a hospital. A pathologist testified that midazolam was given to ''quiet him down'' during an episode of excited delirium but did not contribute to the death, which he blamed on prone restraint and meth use.
His wife said Gutzalenko, a former critical care nurse, would never have consented to receive midazolam that day.
''I know from being a registered nurse since 2004, you don't administer a sedative to someone who is clearly already in respiratory distress,'' she said, adding that his death has been devastating to their two teenage children.
Dr. Gail Van Norman, a University of Washington professor of anesthesiology and pain medicine, said it's dangerous for officers to put pressure on the backs and necks of detainees before and after they're injected with sedatives.
''It's a recipe for disaster, because you may have created a situation in which you are impeding a person's ability to get oxygen,'' she said.
The AP investigation found half who died following sedation had been shocked with a Taser and the majority had been restrained facedown.
Their blood acid levels may already have been spiking from drugs, adrenaline and pain while oxygen levels may have been plummeting life-threatening conditions called acidosis and hypoxia.
Sedatives can dull the instinct to compensate by breathing quickly and heavily to blow off carbon dioxide, essential for the heart to beat, said Dr. Christopher Stephens, a UTHealth Houston anesthesiologist and former paramedic.
Under sedation, he said, the body doesn't respond as efficiently to the buildup of carbon dioxide. ''Your brain doesn't care as much about it,'' Stephens said. ''And they can go into respiratory and cardiac arrest.''
Paramedics usually have no idea whether their patients have alcohol, opioids or other depressants in their bodies that increase sedatives' effects on breathing.
More than a dozen who died had been drinking, including Jerica LaCour, 29, a Colorado Springs, Colorado, mother of five young children.
She was stressed about family finances, husband Anthony LaCour recalled, when deputies found her trespassing at a trucking company.
''Guess who gets ketamine?'' paramedic Jason Poulson of AMR, the nation's largest ambulance company, said as LaCour was restrained on a gurney, according to body-camera footage.
An EMT said in a report that she told Poulson that LaCour had calmed and didn't need ketamine, and later warned that LaCour was no longer breathing. In a disciplinary agreement with state regulators, Poulson admitted he was unsuccessful in protecting LaCour's airway despite multiple attempts, mishandled the syringe and failed to document the ketamine use properly. His state certification was put on probation.
AMR and Poulson deny responsibility for LaCour's death in her family's pending lawsuit, arguing LaCour was experiencing excited delirium and ketamine was appropriate.
AFTER DEATH, SEDATION GOES UNQUESTIONED
When people died, the use of sedation often went unacknowledged publicly and unquestioned by investigators.
After Jackson's death in Wisconsin, police press releases said nothing about ketamine. State police redacted mention of the drug from investigation records and blurred video of the prone restraint and injection, saying his family's privacy outweighed the public interest in disclosure.
The fire department, which declined comment, blacked out the information in its incident report. But when AP uploaded the document, redactions disappeared, revealing Jackson was given 400 milligrams of ketamine.
An autopsy concluded Jackson died from complications caused by meth. The report said Jackson's ketamine dose was 100 milligrams, a quarter of what the fire department report said.
Two longtime forensic pathologists who reviewed the case for AP said meth use wasn't the only factor. Dr. Joye Carter said she believed the police altercation and ketamine caused the death, saying the sedative can cause heart problems when given to a meth user.
Dr. Victor Weedn said the level of meth in Jackson's blood was high but generally not lethal. He said Jackson likely died from high blood acid levels, with police restraint and possibly ketamine contributing.
The autopsy was performed in Ramsey County, Minnesota. A county spokesperson defended the findings from a now-retired medical examiner, saying the discrepancy on the ketamine dose wasn't significant.
Citing the autopsy's finding that meth was the cause, Eau Claire County District Attorney Peter Rindal ruled Jackson's case was not an ''officer-involved death'' under Wisconsin law and closed the investigation.
In nearly 90% of the deaths examined by AP, coroners and medical examiners did not list sedation as a cause or contributing factor. Some autopsy reports failed to document that the deceased had been sedated.
The most common ruling was an accidental death in which other drugs, often meth or cocaine, were causes or contributing factors. More than a quarter were at least partially attributed to excited delirium.
Medical examiners view sedatives as safe treatments to control patients and wouldn't question their use unless there was a grievous error, said Dr. James Gill, the chief medical examiner of Connecticut and past president of the National Association of Medical Examiners.
''Generally we're going to default then back to what's the underlying disease or injury that started this chain of events,'' Gill said.
He said sedatives rarely cause deaths by themselves but additional studies could look at whether they play a role in fatal police struggles where many factors are involved.
Even when autopsies implicated sedatives, investigations didn't always follow.
In LaCour's case, the coroner found she died from ''respiratory arrest associated with acute alcohol and ketamine intoxication.'' The district attorney's office said it had no record of reviewing her death.
Nine miles from LaCour's injection, a paramedic injected 26-year-old Hunter Barr with ketamine as officers held him facedown in the dirt outside his Colorado Springs home in September 2020.
Retired postal worker Mark Barr had called 911 for help controlling his son, who he said wasn't violent but was having a bad reaction to LSD. He watched as a medic gave two injections just minutes apart. He said he couldn't figure out why the second injection was necessary, saying his son was subdued. Hunter Barr became unconscious on the way to a hospital and died within hours.
The coroner ruled Barr died from the effects of ketamine. The Colorado Springs Police Department closed the case as ''non-criminal'' and the DA's office again had no review.
When deaths were investigated, inquiries usually focused on whether police used excessive force. In audio and video reviewed by AP, investigators seemed uninterested in how sedation may have contributed.
''I'm not trying to get in the weeds with a whole bunch of that,'' an investigator told a paramedic explaining the ketamine injection he gave 18-year-old Giovani Berne before Berne's heart stopped in Palm Bay, Florida, in 2016.
Berne's sister, Christina, said the family didn't know he had been given ketamine until contacted by AP years later, but ''we knew something bad happened in the ambulance.'' A medical examiner ruled that Berne died of excited delirium.
The death of McClain, 23, in Colorado is the only one that resulted in charges against paramedics. Prosecutors argued Aurora paramedics Jeremy Cooper and Peter Cichuniec didn't assess McClain, gave him too much ketamine for someone his size and didn't monitor him afterward.
Their convictions shook the EMS field, whose leaders say treatment mistakes shouldn't be criminalized. Defense attorneys argued the paramedics followed their training on excited delirium and ketamine. A judge gave Cichuniec five years in prison while Cooper is scheduled to be sentenced Friday.
Civil liability is also rare, in part because deaths have multiple causes and some courts have ruled that unwilling injections aren't excessive force even when they cause harm. That hasn't stopped families from trying: A number of wrongful death lawsuits involving sedation are pending.
Lawmakers in Colorado banned excited delirium as a justification for using ketamine and put other restrictions on the drug, but changes in the law elsewhere have been few.
Paramedic reformers are working to address the failures that increase the risk of sedatives contributing to deaths.
Paramedic Eric Jaeger helped rewrite New Hampshire's protocols and, at a fire station in Hooksett, recently used Jackson's death as a training scenario after evaluating the case for AP. He questioned whether sedation was necessary. He said medics failed to thoroughly evaluate Jackson and should have had monitoring equipment ready before any injection.
He said he had been aware of a handful of deaths but the number found by AP ''dramatically increases'' the scope.
''If we don't change the training, change the protocols, change the leadership to make the system safer,'' Jaeger said, ''then we all bear responsibility for future deaths.''

Officers had shocked him with a Taser and pinned him as he pleaded that he couldnt breathe. Now he sat on the ground with hands cuffed behind his back and took in oxygen through a mask.
Then, officers moved Jackson to his side so a medic could inject him with a potent knockout drug.
Its just going to calm you down, an officer assured Jackson. Within minutes, Jacksons heart stopped. He never regained consciousness and died two weeks later.
Jacksons 2021 death illustrates an often-hidden way fatal U.S. police encounters end: not with the firing of an officers gun but with the silent use of a medical syringe.
The practice of giving sedatives to people detained by police has spread quietly across the nation over the last 15 years, built on questionable science and backed by police-aligned experts, an investigation led by The Associated Press has found. Based on thousands of pages of law enforcement and medical records and videos of dozens of incidents, the investigation shows how a strategy intended to reduce violence and save lives has resulted in some avoidable deaths.
At least 94 people died after they were given sedatives and restrained by police from 2012 through 2021, according to findings by the AP in collaboration with FRONTLINE (PBS) and the Howard Centers for Investigative Journalism. Thats nearly 10% of the more than 1,000 deaths identified during the investigation of people subdued by police in ways that are not supposed to be fatal. About half of the 94 who died were Black, including Jackson.
Behind the racial disparity is a disputed medical condition called excited delirium, which fueled the rise of sedation outside hospitals. Critics say its purported symptoms, including superhuman strength and high pain tolerance, play into racist stereotypes about Black people and lead to biased decisions about who needs sedation.
The use of sedatives in half these incidents has never been reported, as scrutiny typically focuses on the actions of police, not medics. Elijah McClains 2019 death in Aurora, Colorado, was a rare exception: Two paramedics were convicted of giving McClain an overdose of ketamine, the same drug given to Jackson. One was sentenced last month to five years in prison and the other was sentenced Friday to 14 months in jail and probation.
It was impossible to determine the role sedatives may have played in each of the 94 deaths, which often involved the use of other potentially dangerous force on people who had taken drugs or consumed alcohol. Medical experts told the AP their impact could be negligible in people who were already dying; the final straw that triggered heart or breathing failure in the medically distressed; or the main cause of death when given in the wrong circumstances or mishandled.
While sedatives were mentioned as a cause or contributing factor in a dozen official death rulings, authorities often didnt even investigate whether injections were appropriate. Medical officials have traditionally viewed them as mostly benign treatments. Now some say they may be playing a bigger role than previously understood and deserve more scrutiny.
Time and time again, the AP found, agitated people who were held by police facedown, often handcuffed and with officers pushing on their backs, struggled to breathe and tried to get free. Citing combativeness, paramedics administered sedatives, further slowing their breathing. Cardiac and respiratory arrest often occurred within minutes.
Paramedics drugged some people who were not a threat to themselves or others, violating treatment guidelines. Medics often didnt know whether other drugs or alcohol were in peoples systems, although some combinations cause serious side effects.
Police officers sometimes improperly encouraged paramedics to give shots to suspects they were detaining.
Responders occasionally joked about the medications power to knock their subjects out. Night, night is heard on videos before deaths in California, Tennessee and Florida.
Emergency medical workers, if they arent careful, can simply become an extension of the polices handcuffs, of their weapons, of their nightsticks, said Claire Zagorski, a former paramedic and an addiction researcher at the University of Texas at Austin.
Supporters say sedatives enable rapid treatment for drug-related behavioral emergencies and psychotic episodes, protect front-line responders from violence and are safely administered thousands of times annually to get people with life-threatening conditions to hospitals. Critics say forced sedation should be strictly limited or banned, arguing the medications, given without consent, are too risky to be administered during police encounters.
Ohio State University professor Dr. Mark DeBard was an important early proponent of sedation, believing it could be used in rare cases when officers encountered extremely agitated people who needed rapid medical treatment. Today, he said hes frustrated officers still sometimes use excessive force instead of treating those incidents as medical emergencies. Hes also surprised paramedics have given unnecessary injections by overdiagnosing excited delirium.
Others say the premise was flawed, with sedatives and police restraint creating a dangerous mix. The deaths have left a trail of grieving relatives from coast to coast.
Theyre running around on the streets administering these heavy-duty medications that could be lethal, said Honey Gutzalenko, a nurse whose husband died after he was injected with midazolam in 2021 while restrained by police near San Francisco. Its just not right.IM BEGGING YOU TO STOP
Jackson was standing on a truck outside a radio station on the border of the small Wisconsin cities of Eau Claire and Altoona. An employee called 911 before dawn on Oct. 8, 2021, hoping officers could shoo away a stranger who doesnt seem to be a threat, but not normal either.
Police video and hundreds of pages of law enforcement and medical records show how the incident escalated.
An Altoona police officer met Jackson in the parking lot. Jackson appeared uneasy and paranoid, looking around and talking softly. He had taken methamphetamine, which a psychiatrist said he used to self-medicate for schizophrenia. Hed been in and out of jail and living on the streets, with frequent visits to the emergency room seeking a place to rest.
The officer, joined by a second Altoona officer and a sheriffs deputy, told him he could leave if he gave his name. Jackson refused.
Police identified him through his tattoos, learning he was on probation for meth possession. They noticed the truck had minor damage and decided to arrest him.
Jackson took off running. The officers chased Jackson, who stopped seconds later and staggered toward the first officer. Body-camera video shows she fired her Taser, its darts striking Jackson in the stomach and thigh. He screamed after the electrical shock and collapsed.
When officers couldnt handcuff Jackson, she fired additional darts, striking Jackson in the back as he lay on the ground. Officers from the Eau Claire Police Department forced Jackson onto his stomach to be handcuffed and restrained him in whats known as the prone position.
Im begging you to stop, Jackson said. I cant breathe.
After a couple of minutes, officers moved him to his side and then sat him up, trying to improve his breathing.
An officer wondered aloud whether Jackson had excited delirium and asked a colleague if paramedics were going to stand around and do nothing. He voiced approval when one arrived with ketamine, adding Jackson would not like it when he gets poked.
The Eau Claire Fire Departments excited delirium protocol advises, Rapid sedation is the key to de-escalation!!!!! The medic measured 400 milligrams after estimating the 6-foot-tall Jackson weighed 175 pounds, enough to immobilize someone within minutes. He injected the medicine into Jacksons buttocks.
Five medical experts who reviewed the case for AP said Jacksons behavior did not appear to be dangerous enough to justify the intervention.
I dont believe he was a candidate for ketamine, said Connecticut paramedic Peter Canning, who said he supports sedating truly violent patients because they stop fighting and are sleeping by the time they get to the hospital.
Minutes later, Jackson stopped breathing on the way to Sacred Heart Hospital. Hed suffered cardiac arrest and, after he was resuscitated, had no brain function.
Jacksons mother, Rita Gowens, collapsed while shopping at an Indiana Walmart when she learned her oldest son was hospitalized and not expected to survive.
Gowens rushed to the hospital 500 miles away, where she was told hed been injected with ketamine. She searched online and was stunned to read its used to tranquilize horses.
Gowens spoke to Jackson, held his hand and hoped for a miracle. She eventually agreed to remove him from a ventilator after his condition didnt improve, singing into his ear as he took his final breaths: Youve never lost a battle, and I know, I know, you never will.
She still has nightmares about how police and medics treated her son, whom she recalls as a happy boy with chunky cheeks that inspired the nickname Meatball. There are few days when she doesnt ask, Why did they give him an animal tranquilizer?KETAMINE MOVES TO THE STREETS
The practice of using ketamine to subdue people outside hospitals began in 2004 when a disturbed man scaled a fence, cut himself with a broken bottle and paced along a narrow strip of concrete on a Minneapolis highway bridge.
The man was in danger of falling into traffic below when officers reached through the fence and grabbed him.
Dr. John Hick, who worked with first responders, heard the emergency radio chatter while driving and rushed to the scene with an idea. Hick gave the man two shots of ketamine, started an IV and kept him breathing with an air mask.
The man stopped struggling, and responders lowered him to safety.
Paramedics had occasionally used other sedatives to calm combative people since the 1980s. Hick and his Hennepin County Medical Center colleague Dr. Jeffrey Ho believed ketamine worked faster and had fewer side effects, showing promise to avert fatal police encounters.
Ho was a leading researcher on Taser safety and an expert witness for the company in wrongful death lawsuits. In a 2007 deposition in one such case, he argued for a potentially life-saving tactic of having sedative injections quickly follow Taser shocks, saying the combination could shorten struggles that, if prolonged, might end in death.
Some doctors at his public hospital in Minneapolis were using something called ketamine, which is an analog to LSD, he said. Its sort of an animal tranquilizer.
The drug became more common outside the hospital in 2008 when Hennepin County paramedics were given permission to use it.
An American College of Emergency Physicians panel that included Ho said in 2009 that ketamine had shown excellent results and safety while acknowledging no research proved it would save lives.
In time, its use became standard from Las Vegas to Columbus, Ohio, to Palm Beach County, Florida. The earliest death involving ketamine documented in APs investigation came in 2015, when 34-year-old Juan Carrizales was injected after struggling with police in the Dallas suburb of Garland, Texas.
Shortly after ketamine became authorized for such use in Arizona in 2017, deputies who were restraining David Cutler facedown in handcuffs in the scorching desert asked a paramedic to sedate him.
The medic testified he was surprised when Cutler stopped breathing, although the dose was larger than recommended for someone weighing 132 pounds. He said he had been trained that ketamine didnt impact respiration. Cutlers death was ruled an accident due to heat exposure and LSD though that was disputed by experts hired by Cutlers family, who said heat stroke along with ketamine caused his death.
In Minneapolis, an oversight agency found the use of ketamine during police calls rose dramatically from 2012 through 2017 and body-camera video showed instances of officers appearing to pressure paramedics to use ketamine and joking about its power. The department told officers they could never suggest or demand the use of sedation.
Facing criticism, Hennepin Healthcare halted a study examining the effectiveness of ketamine on agitated patients. The Food and Drug Administration later found the research failed to protect vulnerable, intoxicated people who had not given consent.
By 2021, the American College of Emergency Physicians warned ketamine impacted breathing and the heart more than previously believed.
Ketamine is not as benign as we might have hoped it to be, a co-author of the new position, Dr. Jeffrey Goodloe, said on the groups podcast in 2022.
He said the practice of giving large doses of ketamine, sometimes too much for smaller patients, had spread nationwide as agencies copied each others protocols with little independent review.
But the APs findings show risks of sedation go beyond ketamine, which was used in at least 19 cases.
Roughly half of the 94 deaths documented by the AP came after the use of midazolam, which has long been known to heighten the risk of respiratory depression. Many came during police encounters in California, where ketamine is not widely used. Midazolam, a common pre-surgery drug known by the brand name Versed, is also part of a three-drug cocktail used in some states to execute prisoners.
Other cases involved a range of other drugs, including the antipsychotic medications haloperidol and ziprasidone, which can cause irregular heartbeats.
The need for monitoring side effects is often laid out for paramedics in written guidelines, many of which are based on the disputed belief that excited delirium can cause sudden death.THE HISTORY OF EXCITED DELIRIUM
The theory of excited delirium was troubling from the start.
In the 1980s, with cocaine use soaring, Dr. Charles Wetli, a Miami forensic pathologist, coined the term to explain a handful of deaths of violent cocaine users, many of whom had been restrained by police. Wetli, who died in 2020, also blamed excited delirium for the mysterious deaths of more than a dozen Black women. He said cocaine and sexual activity triggered the fatal condition.
The womens deaths eventually were attributed to a serial killer. Wetlis theory survived. And over time, symptoms described by Wetli and others superhuman strength, animal-like noises and high pain tolerance became disproportionately assigned to Black people. The terms spread to police and emergency medical services to describe certain agitated people and explain sudden deaths.
By the mid-2000s, police were encountering more drug users and mentally ill people as stimulant use increased and psychiatric hospitals closed. Departments adopted Tasers as a less-lethal alternative to firearms, but there was a problem hundreds died after being jolted.
Supporters of Wetlis research, including the medical examiner in Miami-Dade County, ruled again and again that excited delirium was the cause of these deaths, not the effects of the weapons and other physical force. Executives at Tasers manufacturer agreed, promoting excited delirium to medical examiners around the country and retaining experts who explained the concept to juries in wrongful death lawsuits.
In 2006, a grand jury that investigated Taser-related deaths in Miami-Dade recommended an untested treatment that it said could save people before they died from excited delirium: squirting midazolam up their noses to cause almost immediate sedation. Its report acknowledged they may experience difficulty in breathing. Miami-Dade paramedics adopted this treatment.
But key medical groups didnt recognize excited delirium, and activists were calling for limits on Taser use. What happened next would help promote sedation alongside Tasers as tools to gain control.
In 2008, the biggest names in excited delirium research gathered at a Las Vegas hotel for a three-day meeting organized by a group with ties to Tasers manufacturer.
A lot of talk took place on chemical sedation because the cops didnt know what to do with these people, recalled John Peters, president of the Institute for the Prevention of In-Custody Deaths, which sponsored the meeting. Jeff Ho had done some work up in Minnesota. He said, Look. Ive been using ketamine. It knocks them out quicker.
The timing was fortuitous: The American College of Emergency Physicians would soon form a task force to study excited delirium and how police and medics should respond.
The 19-member panel included Ho, who became Tasers medical director under an arrangement in which the company paid part of his hospital salary; Dr. Donald Dawes, a Taser research consultant; and University of Miami researcher Deborah Mash, who testified for Taser about several deaths she blamed on excited delirium. At least two other panelists were routinely retained by officers and their departments as expert witnesses.
The panels 2009 paper disclosed none of these relationships. It found excited delirium was real, could result in death regardless of whether someone was shocked with a Taser and called for aggressive chemical sedation to treat the symptoms.
DeBard, the now-retired Ohio doctor who chaired the panel, told AP he recruited relevant experts to join and that disclosure of conflicts wasnt required by the ER doctors group then. He said Taser didnt influence the outcome, which reflected the panels consensus. Mash said she had no conflict because Taser didnt fund her research. Dawes declined an interview request. Ho didnt return messages.
Taser rebranded itself in 2017 as Axon. A spokesperson for the company declined interview requests and did not respond to written questions.
Dr. Brooks Walsh, an emergency physician in Connecticut who was not on the panel, said the 2009 paper reinforced racial bias as it formalized loaded terms used to describe excited delirium, influencing how the diagnosis would be applied.
Ho and other Taser- and police-aligned experts joined a federally sponsored panel in 2011 that built on the work, recommending four actions on a checklist for officers and paramedics: Identify excited delirium symptoms; control (with a Taser if necessary); sedate; and transport to a hospital.
No test measures for excited delirium, so paramedics faced a judgment call: Which patients were so agitated, strong, impervious to pain and dangerous that they needed to be sedated?
DeBard said the symptoms were based on medical observations, not race. If youve got somebody thats delirious, irrational, aggressive, hyperactive, running around naked, I mean, its really pretty easy to recognize, he said.
Yet, over time, prominent medical groups and some experts pointed to overuse of sedation during police encounters and a disproportionate impact on Black people. Even supporters of the practice have acknowledged that the wrong patients at times have been injected.
The deaths of Black men in police custody, including the 2020 killing of George Floyd, put pressure on the medical community to re-examine excited delirium. The ER doctors group in 2023 withdrew approval of the 2009 paper and said excited delirium shouldnt be used in court testimony. Some doctors called that decision political and note the group still recognizes a similar condition hyperactive delirium with severe agitation that can be treated with sedation. But today no major medical association legitimizes excited delirium.CONVENIENT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT
In more than a dozen cases reviewed by AP, police asked for or suggested the use of sedatives, calling into question whether medics were working for law enforcement or in patients interests. Officers often suggested their detainees had excited delirium.
University of California, Berkeley, law and bioethics professor Osagie Obasogie, who has studied excited delirium and sedation, said officers should be banned from influencing medical care.
We need to be sure that folks are treated in a way that meets their medical needs and not simply given a chemical restraint because its convenient for law enforcement, he said.
Officers are told not to dictate medical treatment but some knuckleheads have done otherwise, said Peters, whose group hosted the 2008 Las Vegas meeting that focused on excited delirium.
Paramedics say they make medical decisions independently from police, following guidelines that call for sedating people who may be dangerous. But in several cases AP found, people were injected though they had calmed down or even passed out after struggles with police.
Ivan Gutzalenko, a 47-year-old father, was struggling to breathe as two officers restrained him in Richmond, California. Gutzalenko told the officers they were hurting him, and bucked to try to get one off his back.
A paramedic viewed Gutzalenkos action as aggression, and went to his ambulance to get a 5-milligram dose of midazolam. When he returned three minutes later, Gutzalenko lay motionless. Hes faking like hes unconscious, an officer said.
The medic plunged the needle into his bicep. Gutzalenkos heart stopped. He was declared dead at a hospital. A pathologist testified that midazolam was given to quiet him down during an episode of excited delirium but did not contribute to the death, which he blamed on prone restraint and meth use.
His wife said Gutzalenko, a former critical care nurse, would never have consented to receive midazolam that day.
I know from being a registered nurse since 2004, you dont administer a sedative to someone who is clearly already in respiratory distress, she said, adding that his death has been devastating to their two teenage children.
Dr. Gail Van Norman, a University of Washington professor of anesthesiology and pain medicine, said its dangerous for officers to put pressure on the backs and necks of detainees before and after theyre injected with sedatives.
Its a recipe for disaster, because you may have created a situation in which you are impeding a persons ability to get oxygen, she said.
The AP investigation found half who died following sedation had been shocked with a Taser and the majority had been restrained facedown.
Their blood acid levels may already have been spiking from drugs, adrenaline and pain while oxygen levels may have been plummeting life-threatening conditions called acidosis and hypoxia.
Sedatives can dull the instinct to compensate by breathing quickly and heavily to blow off carbon dioxide, essential for the heart to beat, said Dr. Christopher Stephens, a UTHealth Houston anesthesiologist and former paramedic.
Under sedation, he said, the body doesnt respond as efficiently to the buildup of carbon dioxide. Your brain doesnt care as much about it, Stephens said. And they can go into respiratory and cardiac arrest.
Paramedics usually have no idea whether their patients have alcohol, opioids or other depressants in their bodies that increase sedatives effects on breathing.
More than a dozen who died had been drinking, including Jerica LaCour, 29, a Colorado Springs, Colorado, mother of five young children.
She was stressed about family finances, husband Anthony LaCour recalled, when deputies found her trespassing at a trucking company.
Guess who gets ketamine? paramedic Jason Poulson of AMR, the nations largest ambulance company, said as LaCour was restrained on a gurney, according to body-camera footage.
An EMT said in a report that she told Poulson that LaCour had calmed and didnt need ketamine, and later warned that LaCour was no longer breathing. In a disciplinary agreement with state regulators, Poulson admitted he was unsuccessful in protecting LaCours airway despite multiple attempts, mishandled the syringe and failed to document the ketamine use properly. His state certification was put on probation.
AMR and Poulson denied responsibility for LaCours death in court filings, arguing LaCour was experiencing excited delirium and ketamine was appropriate. This week they settled a long-pending wrongful death lawsuit, LaCour family attorney Daniel Kay said Friday. He said the settlement amount was confidential and the proceeds would help her children. AMR didnt immediately respond to a request for comment and a man who answered a cellphone number listed for Poulson hung up on a reporter.AFTER DEATH, SEDATION GOES UNQUESTIONED
When people died, the use of sedation often went unacknowledged publicly and unquestioned by investigators.
After Jacksons death in Wisconsin, police press releases said nothing about ketamine. State police redacted mention of the drug from investigation records and blurred video of the prone restraint and injection, saying his familys privacy outweighed the public interest in disclosure.
The fire department, which declined comment, blacked out the information in its incident report. But when AP uploaded the document, redactions disappeared, revealing Jackson was given 400 milligrams of ketamine.
An autopsy concluded Jackson died from complications caused by meth. The report said Jacksons ketamine dose was 100 milligrams, a quarter of what the fire department report said.
Two longtime forensic pathologists who reviewed the case for AP said meth use wasnt the only factor. Dr. Joye Carter said she believed the police altercation and ketamine caused the death, saying the sedative can cause heart problems when given to a meth user.
Dr. Victor Weedn said the level of meth in Jacksons blood was high but generally not lethal. He said Jackson likely died from high blood acid levels, with police restraint and possibly ketamine contributing.
The autopsy was performed in Ramsey County, Minnesota. A county spokesperson defended the findings from a now-retired medical examiner, saying the discrepancy on the ketamine dose wasnt significant.
Citing the autopsys finding that meth was the cause, Eau Claire County District Attorney Peter Rindal ruled Jacksons case was not an officer-involved death under Wisconsin law and closed the investigation.
In nearly 90% of the deaths examined by AP, coroners and medical examiners did not list sedation as a cause or contributing factor. Some autopsy reports failed to document that the deceased had been sedated.
The most common ruling was an accidental death in which other drugs, often meth or cocaine, were causes or contributing factors. More than a quarter were at least partially attributed to excited delirium.
Medical examiners view sedatives as safe treatments to control patients and wouldnt question their use unless there was a grievous error, said Dr. James Gill, the chief medical examiner of Connecticut and past president of the National Association of Medical Examiners.
Generally were going to default then back to whats the underlying disease or injury that started this chain of events, Gill said.
He said sedatives rarely cause deaths by themselves but additional studies could look at whether they play a role in fatal police struggles where many factors are involved.
Even when autopsies implicated sedatives, investigations didnt always follow.
In LaCours case, the coroner found she died from respiratory arrest associated with acute alcohol and ketamine intoxication. The district attorneys office said it had no record of reviewing her death.
Nine miles from LaCours injection, a paramedic injected 26-year-old Hunter Barr with ketamine as officers held him facedown in the dirt outside his Colorado Springs home in September 2020.
Retired postal worker Mark Barr had called 911 for help controlling his son, who he said wasnt violent but was having a bad reaction to LSD. He watched as a medic gave two injections just minutes apart. He said he couldnt figure out why the second injection was necessary, saying his son was subdued. Hunter Barr became unconscious on the way to a hospital and died within hours.
The coroner ruled Barr died from the effects of ketamine. The Colorado Springs Police Department closed the case as non-criminal and the DAs office again had no review.
When deaths were investigated, inquiries usually focused on whether police used excessive force. In audio and video reviewed by AP, investigators seemed uninterested in how sedation may have contributed.
Im not trying to get in the weeds with a whole bunch of that, an investigator told a paramedic explaining the ketamine injection he gave 18-year-old Giovani Berne before Bernes heart stopped in Palm Bay, Florida, in 2016.
Bernes sister, Christina, said the family didnt know he had been given ketamine until contacted by AP years later, but we knew something bad happened in the ambulance. A medical examiner ruled that Berne died of excited delirium.
The death of McClain, 23, in Colorado is the only one that resulted in charges against paramedics. Prosecutors argued Aurora paramedics Jeremy Cooper and Peter Cichuniec didnt assess McClain, gave him too much ketamine for someone his size and didnt monitor him afterward.
Their convictions shook the EMS field, whose leaders say treatment mistakes shouldnt be criminalized. Defense attorneys argued the paramedics followed their training on excited delirium and ketamine. A judge gave Cichuniec five years in prison while Cooper was sentenced Friday to 14 months in jail and probation.
Civil liability is also rare, in part because deaths have multiple causes and some courts have ruled that unwilling injections arent excessive force even when they cause harm. That hasnt stopped families from trying: A number of wrongful death lawsuits involving sedation are pending.
Lawmakers in Colorado banned excited delirium as a justification for using ketamine and put other restrictions on the drug, but changes in the law elsewhere have been few.
Paramedic reformers are working to address the failures that increase the risk of sedatives contributing to deaths.
Paramedic Eric Jaeger helped rewrite New Hampshires protocols and, at a fire station in Hooksett, recently used Jacksons death as a training scenario after evaluating the case for AP. He questioned whether sedation was necessary. He said medics failed to thoroughly evaluate Jackson and should have had monitoring equipment ready before any injection.
He said he had been aware of a handful of deaths but the number found by AP dramatically increases the scope.
If we dont change the training, change the protocols, change the leadership to make the system safer, Jaeger said, then we all bear responsibility for future deaths.",fortune,Fortune,Market Trends & Mixed Quality,"At least 94 people died after they were given sedatives and restrained by police from 2012 through 2021, according to the AP in collaboration with FRONTLINE and the Howard Centers for Investigative Journalism.",medication-assisted treatment,0.6361650228500366

By now you’ve likely seen the statistics: Rates of depression and anxiety in the United States—fairly stable in the 2000s—rose by more than 50 percent in many studies from 2010 to 2019. The suicide rate rose 48 percent for adolescents ages 10 to 19. For girls ages 10 to 14, it rose 131 percent.The problem was not limited to the U.S.: Similar patterns emerged around the same time in Canada, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, the Nordic countries, and beyond. By a variety of measures and in a variety of countries, the members of Generation Z (born in and after 1996) are suffering from anxiety, depression, self-harm, and related disorders at levels higher than any other generation for which we have data.The decline in mental health is just one of many signs that something went awry. Loneliness and friendlessness among American teens began to surge around 2012. Academic achievement went down, too. According to “The Nation’s Report Card,” scores in reading and math began to decline for U.S. students after 2012, reversing decades of slow but generally steady increase. PISA, the major international measure of educational trends, shows that declines in math, reading, and science happened globally, also beginning in the early 2010s.[Read: It sure looks like phones are making students dumber]As the oldest members of Gen Z reach their late 20s, their troubles are carrying over into adulthood. Young adults are dating less, having less sex, and showing less interest in ever having children than prior generations. They are more likely to live with their parents. They were less likely to get jobs as teens, and managers say they are harder to work with. Many of these trends began with earlier generations, but most of them accelerated with Gen Z.Surveys show that members of Gen Z are shyer and more risk averse than previous generations, too, and risk aversion may make them less ambitious. In an interview last May, OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman and Stripe co-founder Patrick Collison noted that, for the first time since the 1970s, none of Silicon Valley’s preeminent entrepreneurs are under 30. “Something has really gone wrong,” Altman said. In a famously young industry, he was baffled by the sudden absence of great founders in their 20s.Generations are not monolithic, of course. Many young people are flourishing. Taken as a whole, however, Gen Z is in poor mental health and is lagging behind previous generations on many important metrics. And if a generation is doing poorly––if it is more anxious and depressed and is starting families, careers, and important companies at a substantially lower rate than previous generations––then the sociological and economic consequences will be profound for the entire society.

What happened in the early 2010s that altered adolescent development and worsened mental health? Theories abound, but the fact that similar trends are found in many countries worldwide means that events and trends that are specific to the United States cannot be the main story.I think the answer can be stated simply, although the underlying psychology is complex: Those were the years when adolescents in rich countries traded in their flip phones for smartphones and moved much more of their social lives online—particularly onto social-media platforms designed for virality and addiction. Once young people began carrying the entire internet in their pockets, available to them day and night, it altered their daily experiences and developmental pathways across the board. Friendship, dating, sexuality, exercise, sleep, academics, politics, family dynamics, identity—all were affected. Life changed rapidly for younger children, too, as they began to get access to their parents’ smartphones and, later, got their own iPads, laptops, and even smartphones during elementary school.[Jonathan Haidt: Get phones out of schools now]As a social psychologist who has long studied social and moral development, I have been involved in debates about the effects of digital technology for years. Typically, the scientific questions have been framed somewhat narrowly, to make them easier to address with data. For example, do adolescents who consume more social media have higher levels of depression? Does using a smartphone just before bedtime interfere with sleep? The answer to these questions is usually found to be yes, although the size of the relationship is often statistically small, which has led some researchers to conclude that these new technologies are not responsible for the gigantic increases in mental illness that began in the early 2010s.But before we can evaluate the evidence on any one potential avenue of harm, we need to step back and ask a broader question: What is childhood––including adolescence––and how did it change when smartphones moved to the center of it? If we take a more holistic view of what childhood is and what young children, tweens, and teens need to do to mature into competent adults, the picture becomes much clearer. Smartphone-based life, it turns out, alters or interferes with a great number of developmental processes.The intrusion of smartphones and social media are not the only changes that have deformed childhood. There’s an important backstory, beginning as long ago as the 1980s, when we started systematically depriving children and adolescents of freedom, unsupervised play, responsibility, and opportunities for risk taking, all of which promote competence, maturity, and mental health. But the change in childhood accelerated in the early 2010s, when an already independence-deprived generation was lured into a new virtual universe that seemed safe to parents but in fact is more dangerous, in many respects, than the physical world.My claim is that the new phone-based childhood that took shape roughly 12 years ago is making young people sick and blocking their progress to flourishing in adulthood. We need a dramatic cultural correction, and we need it now.1. The Decline of Play and Independence Human brains are extraordinarily large compared with those of other primates, and human childhoods are extraordinarily long, too, to give those large brains time to wire up within a particular culture. A child’s brain is already 90 percent of its adult size by about age 6. The next 10 or 15 years are about learning norms and mastering skills—physical, analytical, creative, and social. As children and adolescents seek out experiences and practice a wide variety of behaviors, the synapses and neurons that are used frequently are retained while those that are used less often disappear. Neurons that fire together wire together, as brain researchers say.Brain development is sometimes said to be “experience-expectant,” because specific parts of the brain show increased plasticity during periods of life when an animal’s brain can “expect” to have certain kinds of experiences. You can see this with baby geese, who will imprint on whatever mother-sized object moves in their vicinity just after they hatch. You can see it with human children, who are able to learn languages quickly and take on the local accent, but only through early puberty; after that, it’s hard to learn a language and sound like a native speaker. There is also some evidence of a sensitive period for cultural learning more generally. Japanese children who spent a few years in California in the 1970s came to feel “American” in their identity and ways of interacting only if they attended American schools for a few years between ages 9 and 15. If they left before age 9, there was no lasting impact. If they didn’t arrive until they were 15, it was too late; they didn’t come to feel American.Human childhood is an extended cultural apprenticeship with different tasks at different ages all the way through puberty. Once we see it this way, we can identify factors that promote or impede the right kinds of learning at each age. For children of all ages, one of the most powerful drivers of learning is the strong motivation to play. Play is the work of childhood, and all young mammals have the same job: to wire up their brains by playing vigorously and often, practicing the moves and skills they’ll need as adults. Kittens will play-pounce on anything that looks like a mouse tail. Human children will play games such as Tag and Sharks and Minnows, which let them practice both their predator skills and their escaping-from-predator skills. Adolescents will play sports with greater intensity, and will incorporate playfulness into their social interactions—flirting, teasing, and developing inside jokes that bond friends together. Hundreds of studies on young rats, monkeys, and humans show that young mammals want to play, need to play, and end up socially, cognitively, and emotionally impaired when they are deprived of play.One crucial aspect of play is physical risk taking. Children and adolescents must take risks and fail—often—in environments in which failure is not very costly. This is how they extend their abilities, overcome their fears, learn to estimate risk, and learn to cooperate in order to take on larger challenges later. The ever-present possibility of getting hurt while running around, exploring, play-fighting, or getting into a real conflict with another group adds an element of thrill, and thrilling play appears to be the most effective kind for overcoming childhood anxieties and building social, emotional, and physical competence. The desire for risk and thrill increases in the teen years, when failure might carry more serious consequences. Children of all ages need to choose the risk they are ready for at a given moment. Young people who are deprived of opportunities for risk taking and independent exploration will, on average, develop into more anxious and risk-averse adults.[From the April 2014 issue: The overprotected kid]Human childhood and adolescence evolved outdoors, in a physical world full of dangers and opportunities. Its central activities––play, exploration, and intense socializing––were largely unsupervised by adults, allowing children to make their own choices, resolve their own conflicts, and take care of one another. Shared adventures and shared adversity bound young people together into strong friendship clusters within which they mastered the social dynamics of small groups, which prepared them to master bigger challenges and larger groups later on.And then we changed childhood.The changes started slowly in the late 1970s and ’80s, before the arrival of the internet, as many parents in the U.S. grew fearful that their children would be harmed or abducted if left unsupervised. Such crimes have always been extremely rare, but they loomed larger in parents’ minds thanks in part to rising levels of street crime combined with the arrival of cable TV, which enabled round-the-clock coverage of missing-children cases. A general decline in social capital––the degree to which people knew and trusted their neighbors and institutions––exacerbated parental fears. Meanwhile, rising competition for college admissions encouraged more intensive forms of parenting. In the 1990s, American parents began pulling their children indoors or insisting that afternoons be spent in adult-run enrichment activities. Free play, independent exploration, and teen-hangout time declined.In recent decades, seeing unchaperoned children outdoors has become so novel that when one is spotted in the wild, some adults feel it is their duty to call the police. In 2015, the Pew Research Center found that parents, on average, believed that children should be at least 10 years old to play unsupervised in front of their house, and that kids should be 14 before being allowed to go unsupervised to a public park. Most of these same parents had enjoyed joyous and unsupervised outdoor play by the age of 7 or 8.But overprotection is only part of the story. The transition away from a more independent childhood was facilitated by steady improvements in digital technology, which made it easier and more inviting for young people to spend a lot more time at home, indoors, and alone in their rooms. Eventually, tech companies got access to children 24/7. They developed exciting virtual activities, engineered for “engagement,” that are nothing like the real-world experiences young brains evolved to expect.2. The Virtual World Arrives in Two WavesThe internet, which now dominates the lives of young people, arrived in two waves of linked technologies. The first one did little harm to Millennials. The second one swallowed Gen Z whole.The first wave came ashore in the 1990s with the arrival of dial-up internet access, which made personal computers good for something beyond word processing and basic games. By 2003, 55 percent of American households had a computer with (slow) internet access. Rates of adolescent depression, loneliness, and other measures of poor mental health did not rise in this first wave. If anything, they went down a bit. Millennial teens (born 1981 through 1995), who were the first to go through puberty with access to the internet, were psychologically healthier and happier, on average, than their older siblings or parents in Generation X (born 1965 through 1980).The second wave began to rise in the 2000s, though its full force didn’t hit until the early 2010s. It began rather innocently with the introduction of social-media platforms that helped people connect with their friends. Posting and sharing content became much easier with sites such as Friendster (launched in 2003), Myspace (2003), and Facebook (2004).Teens embraced social media soon after it came out, but the time they could spend on these sites was limited in those early years because the sites could only be accessed from a computer, often the family computer in the living room. Young people couldn’t access social media (and the rest of the internet) from the school bus, during class time, or while hanging out with friends outdoors. Many teens in the early-to-mid-2000s had cellphones, but these were basic phones (many of them flip phones) that had no internet access. Typing on them was difficult––they had only number keys. Basic phones were tools that helped Millennials meet up with one another in person or talk with each other one-on-one. I have seen no evidence to suggest that basic cellphones harmed the mental health of Millennials.It was not until the introduction of the iPhone (2007), the App Store (2008), and high-speed internet (which reached 50 percent of American homes in 2007)—and the corresponding pivot to mobile made by many providers of social media, video games, and porn—that it became possible for adolescents to spend nearly every waking moment online. The extraordinary synergy among these innovations was what powered the second technological wave. In 2011, only 23 percent of teens had a smartphone. By 2015, that number had risen to 73 percent, and a quarter of teens said they were online “almost constantly.” Their younger siblings in elementary school didn’t usually have their own smartphones, but after its release in 2010, the iPad quickly became a staple of young children’s daily lives. It was in this brief period, from 2010 to 2015, that childhood in America (and many other countries) was rewired into a form that was more sedentary, solitary, virtual, and incompatible with healthy human development.3. Techno-optimism and the Birth of the Phone-Based ChildhoodThe phone-based childhood created by that second wave—including not just smartphones themselves, but all manner of internet-connected devices, such as tablets, laptops, video-game consoles, and smartwatches—arrived near the end of a period of enormous optimism about digital technology. The internet came into our lives in the mid-1990s, soon after the fall of the Soviet Union. By the end of that decade, it was widely thought that the web would be an ally of democracy and a slayer of tyrants. When people are connected to each other, and to all the information in the world, how could any dictator keep them down?In the 2000s, Silicon Valley and its world-changing inventions were a source of pride and excitement in America. Smart and ambitious young people around the world wanted to move to the West Coast to be part of the digital revolution. Tech-company founders such as Steve Jobs and Sergey Brin were lauded as gods, or at least as modern Prometheans, bringing humans godlike powers. The Arab Spring bloomed in 2011 with the help of decentralized social platforms, including Twitter and Facebook. When pundits and entrepreneurs talked about the power of social media to transform society, it didn’t sound like a dark prophecy.You have to put yourself back in this heady time to understand why adults acquiesced so readily to the rapid transformation of childhood. Many parents had concerns, even then, about what their children were doing online, especially because of the internet’s ability to put children in contact with strangers. But there was also a lot of excitement about the upsides of this new digital world. If computers and the internet were the vanguards of progress, and if young people––widely referred to as “digital natives”––were going to live their lives entwined with these technologies, then why not give them a head start? I remember how exciting it was to see my 2-year-old son master the touch-and-swipe interface of my first iPhone in 2008. I thought I could see his neurons being woven together faster as a result of the stimulation it brought to his brain, compared to the passivity of watching television or the slowness of building a block tower. I thought I could see his future job prospects improving.Touchscreen devices were also a godsend for harried parents. Many of us discovered that we could have peace at a restaurant, on a long car trip, or at home while making dinner or replying to emails if we just gave our children what they most wanted: our smartphones and tablets. We saw that everyone else was doing it and figured it must be okay.It was the same for older children, desperate to join their friends on social-media platforms, where the minimum age to open an account was set by law to 13, even though no research had been done to establish the safety of these products for minors. Because the platforms did nothing (and still do nothing) to verify the stated age of new-account applicants, any 10-year-old could open multiple accounts without parental permission or knowledge, and many did. Facebook and later Instagram became places where many sixth and seventh graders were hanging out and socializing. If parents did find out about these accounts, it was too late. Nobody wanted their child to be isolated and alone, so parents rarely forced their children to shut down their accounts.We had no idea what we were doing.4. The High Cost of a Phone-Based ChildhoodIn Walden, his 1854 reflection on simple living, Henry David Thoreau wrote, “The cost of a thing is the amount of … life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run.” It’s an elegant formulation of what economists would later call the opportunity cost of any choice—all of the things you can no longer do with your money and time once you’ve committed them to something else. So it’s important that we grasp just how much of a young person’s day is now taken up by their devices.The numbers are hard to believe. The most recent Gallup data show that American teens spend about five hours a day just on social-media platforms (including watching videos on TikTok and YouTube). Add in all the other phone- and screen-based activities, and the number rises to somewhere between seven and nine hours a day, on average. The numbers are even higher in single-parent and low-income families, and among Black, Hispanic, and Native American families.These very high numbers do not include time spent in front of screens for school or homework, nor do they include all the time adolescents spend paying only partial attention to events in the real world while thinking about what they’re missing on social media or waiting for their phones to ping. Pew reports that in 2022, one-third of teens said they were on one of the major social-media sites “almost constantly,” and nearly half said the same of the internet in general. For these heavy users, nearly every waking hour is an hour absorbed, in full or in part, by their devices.In Thoreau’s terms, how much of life is exchanged for all this screen time? Arguably, most of it. Everything else in an adolescent’s day must get squeezed down or eliminated entirely to make room for the vast amount of content that is consumed, and for the hundreds of “friends,” “followers,” and other network connections that must be serviced with texts, posts, comments, likes, snaps, and direct messages. I recently surveyed my students at NYU, and most of them reported that the very first thing they do when they open their eyes in the morning is check their texts, direct messages, and social-media feeds. It’s also the last thing they do before they close their eyes at night. And it’s a lot of what they do in between.The amount of time that adolescents spend sleeping declined in the early 2010s, and many studies tie sleep loss directly to the use of devices around bedtime, particularly when they’re used to scroll through social media. Exercise declined, too, which is unfortunate because exercise, like sleep, improves both mental and physical health. Book reading has been declining for decades, pushed aside by digital alternatives, but the decline, like so much else, sped up in the early 2010s. With passive entertainment always available, adolescent minds likely wander less than they used to; contemplation and imagination might be placed on the list of things winnowed down or crowded out.But perhaps the most devastating cost of the new phone-based childhood was the collapse of time spent interacting with other people face-to-face. A study of how Americans spend their time found that, before 2010, young people (ages 15 to 24) reported spending far more time with their friends (about two hours a day, on average, not counting time together at school) than did older people (who spent just 30 to 60 minutes with friends). Time with friends began decreasing for young people in the 2000s, but the drop accelerated in the 2010s, while it barely changed for older people. By 2019, young people’s time with friends had dropped to just 67 minutes a day. It turns out that Gen Z had been socially distancing for many years and had mostly completed the project by the time COVID-19 struck.[Read: What happens when kids don’t see their peers for months]You might question the importance of this decline. After all, isn’t much of this online time spent interacting with friends through texting, social media, and multiplayer video games? Isn’t that just as good?Some of it surely is, and virtual interactions offer unique benefits too, especially for young people who are geographically or socially isolated. But in general, the virtual world lacks many of the features that make human interactions in the real world nutritious, as we might say, for physical, social, and emotional development. In particular, real-world relationships and social interactions are characterized by four features—typical for hundreds of thousands of years—that online interactions either distort or erase.First, real-world interactions are embodied, meaning that we use our hands and facial expressions to communicate, and we learn to respond to the body language of others. Virtual interactions, in contrast, mostly rely on language alone. No matter how many emojis are offered as compensation, the elimination of communication channels for which we have eons of evolutionary programming is likely to produce adults who are less comfortable and less skilled at interacting in person.Second, real-world interactions are synchronous; they happen at the same time. As a result, we learn subtle cues about timing and conversational turn taking. Synchronous interactions make us feel closer to the other person because that’s what getting “in sync” does. Texts, posts, and many other virtual interactions lack synchrony. There is less real laughter, more room for misinterpretation, and more stress after a comment that gets no immediate response.Third, real-world interactions primarily involve one‐to‐one communication, or sometimes one-to-several. But many virtual communications are broadcast to a potentially huge audience. Online, each person can engage in dozens of asynchronous interactions in parallel, which interferes with the depth achieved in all of them. The sender’s motivations are different, too: With a large audience, one’s reputation is always on the line; an error or poor performance can damage social standing with large numbers of peers. These communications thus tend to be more performative and anxiety-inducing than one-to-one conversations.Finally, real-world interactions usually take place within communities that have a high bar for entry and exit, so people are strongly motivated to invest in relationships and repair rifts when they happen. But in many virtual networks, people can easily block others or quit when they are displeased. Relationships within such networks are usually more disposable.[From the September 2015 issue: The coddling of the American mind]These unsatisfying and anxiety-producing features of life online should be recognizable to most adults. Online interactions can bring out antisocial behavior that people would never display in their offline communities. But if life online takes a toll on adults, just imagine what it does to adolescents in the early years of puberty, when their “experience expectant” brains are rewiring based on feedback from their social interactions.Kids going through puberty online are likely to experience far more social comparison, self-consciousness, public shaming, and chronic anxiety than adolescents in previous generations, which could potentially set developing brains into a habitual state of defensiveness. The brain contains systems that are specialized for approach (when opportunities beckon) and withdrawal (when threats appear or seem likely). People can be in what we might call “discover mode” or “defend mode” at any moment, but generally not both. The two systems together form a mechanism for quickly adapting to changing conditions, like a thermostat that can activate either a heating system or a cooling system as the temperature fluctuates. Some people’s internal thermostats are generally set to discover mode, and they flip into defend mode only when clear threats arise. These people tend to see the world as full of opportunities. They are happier and less anxious. Other people’s internal thermostats are generally set to defend mode, and they flip into discover mode only when they feel unusually safe. They tend to see the world as full of threats and are more prone to anxiety and depressive disorders.

A simple way to understand the differences between Gen Z and previous generations is that people born in and after 1996 have internal thermostats that were shifted toward defend mode. This is why life on college campuses changed so suddenly when Gen Z arrived, beginning around 2014. Students began requesting “safe spaces” and trigger warnings. They were highly sensitive to “microaggressions” and sometimes claimed that words were “violence.” These trends mystified those of us in older generations at the time, but in hindsight, it all makes sense. Gen Z students found words, ideas, and ambiguous social encounters more threatening than had previous generations of students because we had fundamentally altered their psychological development.5. So Many HarmsThe debate around adolescents’ use of smartphones and social media typically revolves around mental health, and understandably so. But the harms that have resulted from transforming childhood so suddenly and heedlessly go far beyond mental health. I’ve touched on some of them—social awkwardness, reduced self-confidence, and a more sedentary childhood. Here are three additional harms.Fragmented Attention, Disrupted LearningStaying on task while sitting at a computer is hard enough for an adult with a fully developed prefrontal cortex. It is far more difficult for adolescents in front of their laptop trying to do homework. They are probably less intrinsically motivated to stay on task. They’re certainly less able, given their undeveloped prefrontal cortex, and hence it’s easy for any company with an app to lure them away with an offer of social validation or entertainment. Their phones are pinging constantly—one study found that the typical adolescent now gets 237 notifications a day, roughly 15 every waking hour. Sustained attention is essential for doing almost anything big, creative, or valuable, yet young people find their attention chopped up into little bits by notifications offering the possibility of high-pleasure, low-effort digital experiences.It even happens in the classroom. Studies confirm that when students have access to their phones during class time, they use them, especially for texting and checking social media, and their grades and learning suffer. This might explain why benchmark test scores began to decline in the U.S. and around the world in the early 2010s—well before the pandemic hit.Addiction and Social WithdrawalThe neural basis of behavioral addiction to social media or video games is not exactly the same as chemical addiction to cocaine or opioids. Nonetheless, they all involve abnormally heavy and sustained activation of dopamine neurons and reward pathways. Over time, the brain adapts to these high levels of dopamine; when the child is not engaged in digital activity, their brain doesn’t have enough dopamine, and the child experiences withdrawal symptoms. These generally include anxiety, insomnia, and intense irritability. Kids with these kinds of behavioral addictions often become surly and aggressive, and withdraw from their families into their bedrooms and devices.Social-media and gaming platforms were designed to hook users. How successful are they? How many kids suffer from digital addictions?The main addiction risks for boys seem to be video games and porn. “Internet gaming disorder,” which was added to the main diagnosis manual of psychiatry in 2013 as a condition for further study, describes “significant impairment or distress” in several aspects of life, along with many hallmarks of addiction, including an inability to reduce usage despite attempts to do so. Estimates for the prevalence of IGD range from 7 to 15 percent among adolescent boys and young men. As for porn, a nationally representative survey of American adults published in 2019 found that 7 percent of American men agreed or strongly agreed with the statement “I am addicted to pornography”—and the rates were higher for the youngest men.Girls have much lower rates of addiction to video games and porn, but they use social media more intensely than boys do. A study of teens in 29 nations found that between 5 and 15 percent of adolescents engage in what is called “problematic social media use,” which includes symptoms such as preoccupation, withdrawal symptoms, neglect of other areas of life, and lying to parents and friends about time spent on social media. That study did not break down results by gender, but many others have found that rates of “problematic use” are higher for girls.[Jonathan Haidt: The dangerous experiment on teen girls]I don’t want to overstate the risks: Most teens do not become addicted to their phones and video games. But across multiple studies and across genders, rates of problematic use come out in the ballpark of 5 to 15 percent. Is there any other consumer product that parents would let their children use relatively freely if they knew that something like one in 10 kids would end up with a pattern of habitual and compulsive use that disrupted various domains of life and looked a lot like an addiction?The Decay of Wisdom and the Loss of Meaning During that crucial sensitive period for cultural learning, from roughly ages 9 through 15, we should be especially thoughtful about who is socializing our children for adulthood. Instead, that’s when most kids get their first smartphone and sign themselves up (with or without parental permission) to consume rivers of content from random strangers. Much of that content is produced by other adolescents, in blocks of a few minutes or a few seconds.This rerouting of enculturating content has created a generation that is largely cut off from older generations and, to some extent, from the accumulated wisdom of humankind, including knowledge about how to live a flourishing life. Adolescents spend less time steeped in their local or national culture. They are coming of age in a confusing, placeless, ahistorical maelstrom of 30-second stories curated by algorithms designed to mesmerize them. Without solid knowledge of the past and the filtering of good ideas from bad––a process that plays out over many generations––young people will be more prone to believe whatever terrible ideas become popular around them, which might explain why videos showing young people reacting positively to Osama bin Laden’s thoughts about America were trending on TikTok last fall.  All this is made worse by the fact that so much of digital public life is an unending supply of micro dramas about somebody somewhere in our country of 340 million people who did something that can fuel an outrage cycle, only to be pushed aside by the next. It doesn’t add up to anything and leaves behind only a distorted sense of human nature and affairs.When our public life becomes fragmented, ephemeral, and incomprehensible, it is a recipe for anomie, or normlessness. The great French sociologist Émile Durkheim showed long ago that a society that fails to bind its people together with some shared sense of sacredness and common respect for rules and norms is not a society of great individual freedom; it is, rather, a place where disoriented individuals have difficulty setting goals and exerting themselves to achieve them. Durkheim argued that anomie was a major driver of suicide rates in European countries. Modern scholars continue to draw on his work to understand suicide rates today.

Durkheim’s observations are crucial for understanding what happened in the early 2010s. A long-running survey of American teens found that, from 1990 to 2010, high-school seniors became slightly less likely to agree with statements such as “Life often feels meaningless.” But as soon as they adopted a phone-based life and many began to live in the whirlpool of social media, where no stability can be found, every measure of despair increased. From 2010 to 2019, the number who agreed that their lives felt “meaningless” increased by about 70 percent, to more than one in five.6. Young People Don’t Like Their Phone-Based LivesHow can I be confident that the epidemic of adolescent mental illness was kicked off by the arrival of the phone-based childhood? Skeptics point to other events as possible culprits, including the 2008 global financial crisis, global warming, the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting and the subsequent active-shooter drills, rising academic pressures, and the opioid epidemic. But while these events might have been contributing factors in some countries, none can explain both the timing and international scope of the disaster.An additional source of evidence comes from Gen Z itself. With all the talk of regulating social media, raising age limits, and getting phones out of schools, you might expect to find many members of Gen Z writing and speaking out in opposition. I’ve looked for such arguments and found hardly any. In contrast, many young adults tell stories of devastation.Freya India, a 24-year-old British essayist who writes about girls, explains how social-media sites carry girls off to unhealthy places: “It seems like your child is simply watching some makeup tutorials, following some mental health influencers, or experimenting with their identity. But let me tell you: they are on a conveyor belt to someplace bad. Whatever insecurity or vulnerability they are struggling with, they will be pushed further and further into it.” She continues:
Gen Z were the guinea pigs in this uncontrolled global social experiment. We were the first to have our vulnerabilities and insecurities fed into a machine that magnified and refracted them back at us, all the time, before we had any sense of who we were. We didn’t just grow up with algorithms. They raised us. They rearranged our faces. Shaped our identities. Convinced us we were sick.

Rikki Schlott, a 23-year-old American journalist and co-author of The Canceling of the American Mind, writes,
The day-to-day life of a typical teen or tween today would be unrecognizable to someone who came of age before the smartphone arrived. Zoomers are spending an average of 9 hours daily in this screen-time doom loop—desperate to forget the gaping holes they’re bleeding out of, even if just for … 9 hours a day. Uncomfortable silence could be time to ponder why they’re so miserable in the first place. Drowning it out with algorithmic white noise is far easier.

A 27-year-old man who spent his adolescent years addicted (his word) to video games and pornography sent me this reflection on what that did to him:
I missed out on a lot of stuff in life—a lot of socialization. I feel the effects now: meeting new people, talking to people. I feel that my interactions are not as smooth and fluid as I want. My knowledge of the world (geography, politics, etc.) is lacking. I didn’t spend time having conversations or learning about sports. I often feel like a hollow operating system.

Or consider what Facebook found in a research project involving focus groups of young people, revealed in 2021 by the whistleblower Frances Haugen: “Teens blame Instagram for increases in the rates of anxiety and depression among teens,” an internal document said. “This reaction was unprompted and consistent across all groups.”How can it be that an entire generation is hooked on consumer products that so few praise and so many ultimately regret using? Because smartphones and especially social media have put members of Gen Z and their parents into a series of collective-action traps. Once you understand the dynamics of these traps, the escape routes become clear.7. Collective-Action ProblemsSocial-media companies such as Meta, TikTok, and Snap are often compared to tobacco companies, but that’s not really fair to the tobacco industry. It’s true that companies in both industries marketed harmful products to children and tweaked their products for maximum customer retention (that is, addiction), but there’s a big difference: Teens could and did choose, in large numbers, not to smoke. Even at the peak of teen cigarette use, in 1997, nearly two-thirds of high-school students did not smoke.Social media, in contrast, applies a lot more pressure on nonusers, at a much younger age and in a more insidious way. Once a few students in any middle school lie about their age and open accounts at age 11 or 12, they start posting photos and comments about themselves and other students. Drama ensues. The pressure on everyone else to join becomes intense. Even a girl who knows, consciously, that Instagram can foster beauty obsession, anxiety, and eating disorders might sooner take those risks than accept the seeming certainty of being out of the loop, clueless, and excluded. And indeed, if she resists while most of her classmates do not, she might, in fact, be marginalized, which puts her at risk for anxiety and depression, though via a different pathway than the one taken by those who use social media heavily. In this way, social media accomplishes a remarkable feat: It even harms adolescents who do not use it.[From the May 2022 issue: Jonathan Haidt on why the past 10 years of American life have been uniquely stupid]A recent study led by the University of Chicago economist Leonardo Bursztyn captured the dynamics of the social-media trap precisely. The researchers recruited more than 1,000 college students and asked them how much they’d need to be paid to deactivate their accounts on either Instagram or TikTok for four weeks. That’s a standard economist’s question to try to compute the net value of a product to society. On average, students said they’d need to be paid roughly $50 ($59 for TikTok, $47 for Instagram) to deactivate whichever platform they were asked about. Then the experimenters told the students that they were going to try to get most of the others in their school to deactivate that same platform, offering to pay them to do so as well, and asked, Now how much would you have to be paid to deactivate, if most others did so? The answer, on average, was less than zero. In each case, most students were willing to pay to have that happen.Social media is all about network effects. Most students are only on it because everyone else is too. Most of them would prefer that nobody be on these platforms. Later in the study, students were asked directly, “Would you prefer to live in a world without Instagram [or TikTok]?” A majority of students said yes––58 percent for each app.This is the textbook definition of what social scientists call a collective-action problem. It’s what happens when a group would be better off if everyone in the group took a particular action, but each actor is deterred from acting, because unless the others do the same, the personal cost outweighs the benefit. Fishermen considering limiting their catch to avoid wiping out the local fish population are caught in this same kind of trap. If no one else does it too, they just lose profit.Cigarettes trapped individual smokers with a biological addiction. Social media has trapped an entire generation in a collective-action problem. Early app developers deliberately and knowingly exploited the psychological weaknesses and insecurities of young people to pressure them to consume a product that, upon reflection, many wish they could use less, or not at all.8. Four Norms to Break Four TrapsYoung people and their parents are stuck in at least four collective-action traps. Each is hard to escape for an individual family, but escape becomes much easier if families, schools, and communities coordinate and act together. Here are four norms that would roll back the phone-based childhood. I believe that any community that adopts all four will see substantial improvements in youth mental health within two years.No smartphones before high school  The trap here is that each child thinks they need a smartphone because “everyone else” has one, and many parents give in because they don’t want their child to feel excluded. But if no one else had a smartphone—or even if, say, only half of the child’s sixth-grade class had one—parents would feel more comfortable providing a basic flip phone (or no phone at all). Delaying round-the-clock internet access until ninth grade (around age 14) as a national or community norm would help to protect adolescents during the very vulnerable first few years of puberty. According to a 2022 British study, these are the years when social-media use is most correlated with poor mental health. Family policies about tablets, laptops, and video-game consoles should be aligned with smartphone restrictions to prevent overuse of other screen activities.No social media before 16The trap here, as with smartphones, is that each adolescent feels a strong need to open accounts on TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, and other platforms primarily because that’s where most of their peers are posting and gossiping. But if the majority of adolescents were not on these accounts until they were 16, families and adolescents could more easily resist the pressure to sign up. The delay would not mean that kids younger than 16 could never watch videos on TikTok or YouTube—only that they could not open accounts, give away their data, post their own content, and let algorithms get to know them and their preferences.Phone‐free schools Most schools claim that they ban phones, but this usually just means that students aren’t supposed to take their phone out of their pocket during class. Research shows that most students do use their phones during class time. They also use them during lunchtime, free periods, and breaks between classes––times when students could and should be interacting with their classmates face-to-face. The only way to get students’ minds off their phones during the school day is to require all students to put their phones (and other devices that can send or receive texts) into a phone locker or locked pouch at the start of the day. Schools that have gone phone-free always seem to report that it has improved the culture, making students more attentive in class and more interactive with one another. Published studies back them up.More independence, free play, and responsibility in the real worldMany parents are afraid to give their children the level of independence and responsibility they themselves enjoyed when they were young, even though rates of homicide, drunk driving, and other physical threats to children are way down in recent decades. Part of the fear comes from the fact that parents look at each other to determine what is normal and therefore safe, and they see few examples of families acting as if a 9-year-old can be trusted to walk to a store without a chaperone. But if many parents started sending their children out to play or run errands, then the norms of what is safe and accepted would change quickly. So would ideas about what constitutes “good parenting.” And if more parents trusted their children with more responsibility––for example, by asking their kids to do more to help out, or to care for others––then the pervasive sense of uselessness now found in surveys of high-school students might begin to dissipate.It would be a mistake to overlook this fourth norm. If parents don’t replace screen time with real-world experiences involving friends and independent activity, then banning devices will feel like deprivation, not the opening up of a world of opportunities.The main reason why the phone-based childhood is so harmful is because it pushes aside everything else. Smartphones are experience blockers. Our ultimate goal should not be to remove screens entirely, nor should it be to return childhood to exactly the way it was in 1960. Rather, it should be to create a version of childhood and adolescence that keeps young people anchored in the real world while flourishing in the digital age.9. What Are We Waiting For?An essential function of government is to solve collective-action problems. Congress could solve or help solve the ones I’ve highlighted—for instance, by raising the age of “internet adulthood” to 16 and requiring tech companies to keep underage children off their sites.In recent decades, however, Congress has not been good at addressing public concerns when the solutions would displease a powerful and deep-pocketed industry. Governors and state legislators have been much more effective, and their successes might let us evaluate how well various reforms work. But the bottom line is that to change norms, we’re going to need to do most of the work ourselves, in neighborhood groups, schools, and other communities.[Read: Why Congress keeps failing to protect kids online]There are now hundreds of organizations––most of them started by mothers who saw what smartphones had done to their children––that are working to roll back the phone-based childhood or promote a more independent, real-world childhood. (I have assembled a list of many of them.) One that I co-founded, at LetGrow.org, suggests a variety of simple programs for parents or schools, such as play club (schools keep the playground open at least one day a week before or after school, and kids sign up for phone-free, mixed-age, unstructured play as a regular weekly activity) and the Let Grow Experience (a series of homework assignments in which students––with their parents’ consent––choose something to do on their own that they’ve never done before, such as walk the dog, climb a tree, walk to a store, or cook dinner).Even without the help of organizations, parents could break their families out of collective-action traps if they coordinated with the parents of their children’s friends. Together they could create common smartphone rules and organize unsupervised play sessions or encourage hangouts at a home, park, or shopping mall.Parents are fed up with what childhood has become. Many are tired of having daily arguments about technologies that were designed to grab hold of their children’s attention and not let go. But the phone-based childhood is not inevitable.The four norms I have proposed cost almost nothing to implement, they cause no clear harm to anyone, and while they could be supported by new legislation, they can be instilled even without it. We can begin implementing all of them right away, this year, especially in communities with good cooperation between schools and parents. A single memo from a principal asking parents to delay smartphones and social media, in support of the school’s effort to improve mental health by going phone free, would catalyze collective action and reset the community’s norms.We didn’t know what we were doing in the early 2010s. Now we do. It’s time to end the phone-based childhood.This article is adapted from Jonathan Haidt’s forthcoming book, The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness.",,The Atlantic,High-Quality News Sources,"For a little over a decade, we have been raising children in an environment that is hostile to human development.

Hoping to stem the loss of life, lawmakers took the controversial step in 2022 of making it a felony to possess even a small amount of fentanyl, the synthetic opioid responsible for most of the state’s fatal overdoses.
Schools and colleges began stocking the overdose-reversal medication naloxone. Families and friends of people killed by fentanyl rallied for more treatment resources. Nonprofits conducted educational campaigns about the dangers of counterfeit medications, advising “one pill can kill.”
Colorado’s quiet killer
Alcohol-related deaths in Colorado spiked during the pandemic, and the state ranks as one of the worst for deaths due to drinking. In this four-part series, The Denver Post examines why so many Coloradans are dying, and ways to save lives that the state hasn’t pursued.
Click here to read more from this series.
Yet at the same time, another drug quietly fueled its own surge in fatalities in Colorado.
Deaths from alcohol in Colorado shot up more than 60% between 2018 and 2021, falling slightly in 2022 — as did fatal overdoses. But alcohol fatalities are still 50% above pre-COVID levels, and experts fear Coloradans’ heavier drinking since 2020 will continue to exact a deadly cost in the years to come.
Alcohol killed 1,547 people statewide in 2022 — fewer than the 1,799 who died of overdoses — but that narrowly defined figure only includes certain types of organ damage and complications of withdrawal. Factor in deaths from long-term complications of drinking, and estimates put alcohol’s annual toll in this state at roughly twice that number.
Coloradans die from the effects of alcohol at one of the highest rates in the country, but, in comparison to fentanyl, the state’s reaction has been a shrug. Legislators haven’t seriously considered measures to discourage drinking, and voters expanded access to alcohol in grocery stores. Gov. Jared Polis said he considers drinking a matter of personal responsibility.
The Denver Post is publishing a four-part series this week examining why Colorado consistently ranks among the worst for alcohol-related deaths. The state hasnt raised alcohol taxes or done anything to restrict access — steps that can reduce deaths. And while treatment is available in Colorado, information about how to access it hasnt always reached families searching for help.
Rep. Marc Snyder, a Colorado Springs Democrat and chair of the House committee that oversees the state’s alcohol regulation said he found it “pretty shocking” to learn alcohol-related deaths are comparable to drug overdoses in Colorado. 
“We kind of forget about alcohol,” he said.
Of course, alcohol and harder drugs like fentanyl also have important differences.
The fact that more people die from alcohol overall reflects that far more people use it. A single, more potent-than-expected dose of fentanyl can kill a user, while heavy drinking can take decades to claim a life. And the two drugs’ secondary effects are difficult to compare: illicit fentanyl brings violent crime from drug trafficking, while alcohol can increase the odds that personal disputes end in assault or murder.
Representatives for the alcohol industry said government intervention isn’t an answer to the growing problem of excessive drinking in Colorado. The state would do better to focus on screening and referring people who need help to treatment as needed, said Amanda Berger, vice president of science and health at the Distilled Spirits Council. Raising taxes will just push drinkers to use cheaper products, she said.
“Tax hikes will unfairly raise the cost on responsible consumers and harm hospitality businesses still trying to rebound from the pandemic amid a host of new challenges, including inflation and staff shortages,” Berger said in a statement.

Only about half of Americans drink on a regular basis, but surveys have shown those who do are more educated and affluent — the kind of people who make the laws, said David Jernigan, a Boston University professor of health law, policy and management who has studied alcohol marketing. Theyre less willing to regulate a socially acceptable drug thats popular in their circles than they are to take a stand against tobacco or opioids, he said.
Lawmakers in charge of regulating alcohol said they were surprised to hear that the number of people dying from drinking was even comparable to deaths from other drugs. They, and the governors office, pointed to Colorado’s efforts to stop underaged people from drinking and to reduce impaired driving.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attributed only about 8% of Colorados alcohol deaths to car crashes, however — fewer than liver disease, cardiovascular problems or suicide. Reducing underage drinking could help stem the tide of deaths, but any effects would be decades in the future. While people who start drinking as teens are at a higher risk for alcohol-related problems, most die in their 50s or later.
For a long time, moderate drinking was considered healthy, or at least not something to worry about. That’s contributed to confusion, because, unlike smokers, regular drinkers don’t know what theyre consuming could hurt them, said Dr. Bill Burman, former director of the Public Health Institute at Denver Health.
Someone who drinks a six-pack of beer on a Saturday night doesn’t necessarily see that as unsafe, even though studies show it increases their risk of premature death, he said.
“I think almost everyone recognizes that severe alcoholism is a problem, that person who’s falling down on the street,” but most people who drink aren’t aware they could be at risk, he said.
The alcohol industry has been quite successful in keeping the focus on the most extreme drinkers, Jernigan said. When someone picks up a pack of cigarettes, they see a warning label that clearly outlines specific diseases they’re risking, but the alcohol label only states that drinking may cause birth defects or interfere with driving, and “may cause health problems.”
“That doesn’t tell you anything,” he said. “You don’t think of alcohol as a factor in heart attacks, as a factor in cognitive decline.”

Lack of a legislative response
Colorado lawmakers havent hesitated to regulate some drug threats.
In addition to making possession of one gram of fentanyl a felony, the state legislature also recently raised the minimum age to buy tobacco to 21 and took steps to reduce youth access to marijuana. Legislators limited the amount of high-potency cannabis products an individual can purchase each day and required a more extensive relationship before a physician can sign off on a medical marijuana card.

Nothing similar has been proposed to reduce alcohol use, even as alcohol-related deaths spiked in Colorado.
In 2018, the State Epidemiological Outcomes Workgroup laid out four strategies to lessen the impact of excessive drinking: reducing the density of businesses selling alcohol, raising alcohol taxes, limiting the hours when alcohol can be sold and increasing liability for selling alcohol to someone who’s underage or already intoxicated.
The state hasn’t done any of those things. Instead, the density of outlets selling alcohol has increased, and the state may extend the hours during which restaurant and bar patrons can drink alcohol next year. In 2022, voters approved Proposition 125, which allowed grocery stores to sell wine, further expanding on a 2019 change that allowed grocers to sell full-strength beer.
That’s not unusual, Jernigan said: passing new alcohol taxes is difficult anywhere, and cities get significant pressure to offer more alcohol licenses as a way to recruit businesses and revitalize struggling areas. Of course, that argument doesn’t account for the costs of increased drinking, such as higher rates of police calls and emergency room visits, he said.
Health and safety is Polis’s “top priority,” and the state has been successful in decreasing underage drinking, said Conor Cahill, a spokesman for the governor. The Colorado Department of Public Safety also provides training to local law enforcement on impaired driving, he said.
“Gov. Polis believes in personal responsibility,” Cahill said. “The state continues to invest in substance-use disorder treatment and alcohol risk education resources, and, ultimately, legal adults have the right to safely and responsibly access alcohol as long as they don’t risk public safety.”
A number of groups representing the alcohol industry, including the Colorado Brewers Guild, Colorado Beer Distributors Association, the Colorado Cider Guild and Molson Coors either declined to comment or didn’t respond to The Post’s requests for an interview.
Micki Hackenberger, executive director of the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of Colorado, said the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights — which requires all tax increases to go before voters — and the ability of local governments to decide where alcohol should be sold limit the state’s ability to make sweeping changes. That said, Colorado has taken steps to reduce deaths through the Task Force on Drunk and Impaired Driving and with efforts to expand training for bartenders and wait staff, she said.
“They actually have done a lot,” Hackenberger said. “Safety is an issue that I think everybody is concerned about.”

The state might pay more attention to alcohol in the near future, since an interim legislative committee proposed a bill that would limit how wine and beer can be displayed in grocery stores, said Raquel Garcia, a member of the Colorado Behavioral Health Administration’s advisory committee.
Garcia said pushing for action on alcohol is difficult, though, because selling it is so profitable, and people who aren’t in addiction recovery haven’t considered it a priority. And, of course, the deaths caused by alcohol are quieter than when someone overdoses on opioids in public.
“We’ve allowed (alcohol) to creep into every segment of our society,” she said. “I think in Colorado, we’ve been irresponsible.”
Pandemic increase in deaths hasn’t ended
Colorado has recorded higher-than-average rates of alcohol-related deaths than the country as a whole since at least 2009, and had the sixth-highest rate in 2021, according to an analysis by KFF, the health policy research organization formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation.
The KFF data, like the states, only includes deaths caused by behavioral health symptoms related to alcohol, like psychosis or withdrawal; alcohol poisoning; and certain alcohol-induced conditions affecting the liver, pancreas, heart, nervous system and stomach.
The CDC estimates include a broader range of causes, and have generally been about double the state’s numbers, but aren’t calculated every year.
Colorado’s alcohol deaths started rising steadily around 2015, then jumped dramatically in 2020 and 2021. In 2022, they dropped from their pandemic high of 1,653, but still were up 50% compared to 2018. The trend persisted even after adjusting for population growth and aging.
“Everyone thought (the increase in alcohol-related deaths) was COVID and the pandemic, and we thought it would go back down,” said Joseph Schacht, a clinical psychologist who studies alcohol at the University of Colorado’s Anschutz Medical Campus.
So far, however, it appears many people have continued to drink at elevated levels, pushing those whose bodies had already sustained some damage into serious illness, he said.
Emily Marberry, of Denver, believes the pandemic contributed to her husband Rick Gildar’s death from liver failure, at just 36.
Gildar was a “super smart” software engineer who could take anything apart and put it back together, and taught himself how to play the guitar, his wife said. But he also had social anxieties and depression that he soothed with alcohol. He went to detox centers two or three times and avoided alcohol for a few months each time, but then would decide he could safely drink again and start the cycle over, she said.
The forced isolation of the first months of the pandemic didn’t help his mental state, Marberry said, and he was discouraged when a rehab facility turned him away in May 2020, saying he was too sick to manage. He stopped drinking for a few months before his death later that year to try to get on the liver transplant list, but it was too late to undo the damage, she said.
“I think those things that happened would make him feel more defeated, and he would drink more,” she said.
Alcohol, suicide deaths related in the West
The states with alcohol-related death rates even higher than Colorados in 2021 were also in the West: New Mexico, South Dakota, Alaska, Wyoming and Montana.
Part of that simply reflects that people living in Western states tend to drink more. With the exception of the period from about 2009 to 2017, the West has had the highest per capita alcohol consumption of any region since the 1970s.
“Heavier-drinking states are going to have higher rates of alcohol-related deaths,” Schacht said.
Coloradans 14 and older drank an average of about three gallons of pure alcohol in 2021, spread out across beer, wine and liquor. That was the ninth-highest consumption rate in the country.
The states residents also reported binge-drinking — five or more drinks on one occasion for a man, or four or more for a woman — at higher rates than Americans overall. About 19% of Colorado adults reported binge drinking in 2022, and 8% reported consistently exceeding the guideline that men have only two drinks a day and women have only one, according to CDC data.
More people likely exceed the healthy drinking guidelines, though, because a cocktail that an average person would consider one drink might contain multiple shots, making it several drinks in the CDC’s eyes.
From the early 1980s to the mid-1990s, average alcohol consumption was trending down in Colorado, but that reversed for unclear reasons. By 2021, the average Coloradan was drinking about 25% more than in 1999. In the same period, consumption increased about 16% nationwide and 15% in the Western region.
Drinking heavily seems to be part of the culture in the West in a way that it isn’t in other parts of the country, Denver Health’s Burman said. While studies generally have described a consistent pattern of heavier drinking in the West, researchers haven’t established why that might be.
The combination is particularly bad, though, given the suicide rate in the Western states, Burman said. Gun ownership is also higher in the West, and using a firearm increases the odds that a suicide attempt will end in death.
A state report found that about 42% of people who died by suicide from 2011 to 2015 and had toxicology information had alcohol in their systems at the time of their deaths. About 28% were legally intoxicated. So far, the states suicide prevention programs havent mentioned alcohol as a risk factor or suggested that people at risk be discouraged from drinking.
“Alcohol lowers that threshold for doing something rash, and that can include suicide,” Burman said.
“A brutal disease”
While alcohol is directly toxic to cells at very high concentrations, most of its health effects seem to come from increasing inflammation in the body, CU Anschutz’s Schacht said.
Over time, that inflammation contributes to cancers or directly causes scarring on organs like the liver, he said. While red wine contains some antioxidant compounds, it doesn’t have high enough concentrations to outweigh the damage caused by the alcohol.
On average, mortality starts to rise significantly when men have about three drinks per day and when women have about two drinks per day, according to a study compiling the available data. People who drank less, or only had alcohol occasionally, didn’t see a significant rise or decline in overall mortality, though the risk of specific diseases rises at lower levels.
Calculating how many people died because of alcohol use is less straightforward when they had illnesses with multiple risk factors, such as breast or throat cancer, strokes, or improper heart rhythms, Schacht said. Researchers have to come up with estimates based on the number of people who died of relevant causes, and how much heavy drinking increases the risk of those conditions, he said.
“There’s certainly a percentage of breast cancer deaths that are attributable to alcohol, but you’ll never see alcohol as a cause on a death certificate” for someone who died of cancer, he said.
Using the CDCs more expansive definition, about 18% of deaths in Colorado of adults 20 to 64 were related to excessive drinking between 2015 and 2019, behind only New Mexico, Alaska and Wyoming. The odds that a death involved alcohol were even higher for adults under 35, with drinking listed as a factor for more than 28% of Coloradans in that age group who died.
While many will still choose to drink, people need accurate information about risk so they can make decisions, as they do when considering whether to try a dangerous sport, Schacht said.
“Really, any level of alcohol use is not great for your health,” he said.
On average, people who die of alcohol-related causes lose about 30 years of potential life, according to a 2021 report from the state health department. That puts them in their prime years for earning income and raising families.
Andrea Carter, of Highlands Ranch, said that in some ways she felt like a single mother even before her husband Matt died of liver disease at 39.

Matt wasn’t a bad person, she said — he was a blast when they were students at Colorado State University and loved the two daughters they had together — but as his drinking escalated over time, he wasn’t emotionally able to be present as a father. Sometimes, she’d take their daughters to their grandparents’ house when he was drinking, because while he was never violent, he’d rapidly lose patience and snap at them.
He sought residential treatment in 2014 and 2015, but the longest stretch he went without alcohol was when he broke both shoulders and couldn’t drive, Carter said. At the time, she said she didn’t know the neurobiology underlying addiction and thought he just wasn’t willing to stop for his family.
It was only after he died in 2018 that Carter told their daughters, who were then 8 and 11, that he would have chosen something different if he could have.
“I don’t wish it on my worst enemy. It’s a brutal disease,” she said.

The overall goal of the NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) program is to help ensure that a diverse pool of highly trained scientists is available in appropriate scientific disciplines to address the Nation's biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research needs. In order to accomplish this goal, NRSA training programs are designed to train individuals to conduct research and to prepare for research careers. More information about NRSA programs may be found at the Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) website.
The NRSA program has been the primary means of supporting predoctoral and postdoctoral research training programs since enactment of the NRSA legislation in 1974. Institutional NRSA programs allow the Training Program Director/Principal Investigator (Training PD/PI) to select trainees and develop an enhanced program of coursework, mentored research experiences, and technical and professional skills development appropriate for the appointed trainees that provides added value to already existing programs.
The grant offsets the cost of stipends, tuition and fees, and training related expenses, including health insurance, for the appointed trainees in accordance with the approved NIH support levels.
Purpose
The purpose of the Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) Institutional Research Training Grant (T32) program is to develop and/or enhance research training opportunities for individuals interested in careers in biomedical, behavioral or social sciences, and clinical research, in health services research, or in any other discipline relevant to the NIH mission.
Each proposed program should provide high-quality research training, and mentored research experiences, and are expected to help trainees develop:

Program Considerations
The duration of training, the transition of trainees to individual support mechanisms, and their transition to the next career stage are important considerations in institutional training programs. Also, an important consideration is the engagement of trainees in their training goals, process and activities through the program that enhances what they may be getting in existing programs within the institution.
Training PD/PIs should:
<ul><li>Limit appointments to individuals who plan to remain in the training program for no less than two years, whether that support comes from a training grant or some combination of NRSA and non-NRSA programs. Short-term training is not intended, and may not be used, to support activities that would ordinarily be part of a research degree program, nor for any undergraduate-level training. Short-term positions should be requested at the time of application, as described in the NIH Grants Policy Statement. Research training programs solely for short-term research training should not apply to this announcement, but rather the T35 NRSA NOFO, which can be found in the NIH Training Kiosk.</li><li>Within the full-time training period, research trainees who are also training as clinicians must devote their time to the proposed research training and confine clinical duties to those that are an integral part of the research training experience or can be conducted in the allowable additional 25% of their time (e.g., 10 hours per week) that may be devoted to clinical employment. The program may not be used to support studies leading to the MD, DDS, or other clinical, health-professional degrees except when those studies are part of a formal combined research degree program, such as the MD/PhD. Similarly, trainees may not accept NRSA support for clinical training that is part of residency training leading to clinical certification in a medical or dental specialty or subspecialty. It is permissible and encouraged, however, for clinicians to engage in NRSA-supported, full-time postdoctoral research training even when that experience is creditable toward certification by a clinical specialty or subspecialty board.</li><li>Encourage and make available appropriate training so that trainees are prepared to apply for subsequent independent support for their training, career development or research program (e.g., an individual fellowship award, mentored career development award, or research project grant), as appropriate for their career stage.</li><li>In addition, past studies have shown that health professional trainees who train in programs with postdoctoral researchers who have intensive research backgrounds are more likely to apply for and receive subsequent research grant support. Therefore, programs that emphasize research training for individuals with the MD or other health-professional degrees are encouraged to develop interactions with basic science departments and include trainees with research doctorates when this approach is consistent with the goals of the proposed training program.</li><li>Encourage the development of institutional training programs that will provide trainees with education and experience in rigorous, reproducible, and transparent scientific approaches, systems for study, tools and technologies.</li><li>Consider team-based research approaches as may also be warranted depending upon the goals of the proposed training program.</li></ul>Within the framework of the NRSA program’s longstanding commitment to excellence, attention should be given to recruiting and retaining trainees from diverse backgrounds, including groups underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral and social sciences, as described in the Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity (NOT-OD-20-031).
Institutional commitment and support for the proposed training program are important elements of the application.
The career outcomes of individuals supported by NRSA training programs are intended to include both research-intensive careers in academia and industry, and research-related careers in various sectors, e.g., academic institutions, government agencies, for-profit businesses, and private foundations. Training programs should make available structured, career development advising and learning opportunities (e.g., workshops, discussions, Individual Development Plans). Through such opportunities, trainees are expected to obtain a working knowledge of various career paths that would make strong use of the knowledge and skills gained during research training and the steps required to transition successfully to the next stage of their chosen career.
Short-term training is not intended, and may not be used, to support activities that would ordinarily be part of a research degree program, nor for any undergraduate-level training. Short-term positions should be requested at the time of application as described in the NIH Grants Policy Statement. Research training programs solely for short-term research training should not apply to this announcement, but rather the T35 NRSA NOFO, which can be found in the NIH Training Kiosk.
This Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) does not allow appointed Trainees to lead an independent clinical trial, but does allow them to obtain research experience in a clinical trial led by a mentor or co-mentor. NIH strongly supports training towards a career in clinically relevant research and so gaining experience in clinical trials under the guidance of a mentor or co-mentor is encouraged.
Program Objectives
Recent advances in medical informatics, electronic health records, big data analytics, mobile and wearable technologies, social media and web generated data, geospatial data, administrative data, and new methods to link data have laid the groundwork for a rich biomedical, behavioral, and social research data environment. The voluminous data environment resulting from diverse data sources will require complex analytical skills to derive rigorous scientific knowledge (Kaplan, Riley, Mabry, 2014).
The purpose of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO)  is to solicit applications for new behavioral and social sciences research (BSSR) predoctoral training programs that focus on innovative computational and/or data science analytic approaches and their incorporation into training for the future BSSR health research workforce. The vision of the Advanced Data Analytics for BSSR training program is to support the development of a cohort of specialized BSSR predoctoral candidates pursuing careers in health-related research who will possess advanced competencies in data science analytics.
Clinical health research is transitioning from a data-limited environment in which data is prospectively obtained to a data-rich environment where data are also collected dynamically from multiple sources and through an increasingly web-interconnected society with a more comprehensive health research infrastructure network. Furthermore, the biomedical scientific community’s increasing emphasis on precision medicine calls on future BSSR scientists to provide an understanding of behavioral and environmental influences within this new data rich frontier. Transdisciplinary complex data research opportunities already are coming to the forefront with NIH initiatives such as the All of Us/Precision Medicine Initiative and the Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) programs. In addition, a key goal in the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science is to enhance workforce development for complex biomedical data (https://datascience.nih.gov/sites/default/files/NIH_Strategic_Plan_for_Data_Science_Final_508.pdf).  These developments and opportunities necessitate a paradigm shift in the BSSR workforce’s training in data analytics to employ research methodologies that are ably suited to temporally dense and dynamically complex data systems.
Big data in the behavioral and social sciences tends to come from mixed sources (e.g., social media, unstructured text, digital sensors or wearables, administrative databases, high-density census population datasets with geographic detail), they are often generated dynamically over time, and not necessarily designed to produce valid or reliable data for scientific analysis. Applying advanced analytic approaches to these kinds of data provides opportunities to transform the spatiotemporal analysis of demographics, behaviors, social interactions, and economics as they relate to health outcomes. Working with disparate social data streams requires careful attention to structuring, harmonizing and extracting meaningful features from the data, which in turn, requires advanced computational and data science statistical approaches. In this sense, behavioral and social sciences “big data” is notable less for size than for the complexity that renders conventional analytic methods inadequate. In addition, BSSR data are becoming increasingly interdisciplinary as they are combined and merged with biomedical, genetic, geospatial, and administrative data. Successful collection and rigorous analysis of complex behavioral and social science health data will require: solid scientific critical thinking skills, cross-disciplinary collaborations, new research methods, computational tools and data science approaches such as data mining, pattern recognition, machine learning, computational modeling, causal inference, and a keen awareness of the continuously emerging data methods, challenges, and opportunities.
The methodology courses in many current Ph.D. programs in the behavioral and social sciences have remained essentially unchanged for the last four decades. To prepare candidates for the world of complex data, the core methods course offerings need to be augmented to provide earlier career training exposure to data science and computational approaches applied in other disciplines such as computer science, applied statistics, and engineering. Training programs may be able to most effectively accomplish this by developing highly coordinated inter-departmental program collaborations for their doctoral candidates.
While there are some existing opportunities for interdisciplinary methods coursework in postdoctoral training programs, there are far fewer opportunities for aspiring BSSR scientists to get exposure to data science and computational modeling methods during their predoctoral years. Changing the career trajectories for a new cohort of BSSR graduates equipped with data science skills will require programs to start earlier and to integrate exposure to data science approaches within existing predoctoral degree programs. Therefore, this training program aims to entice quantitatively-minded students into BSSR careers, and importantly, to create a cohort of specialized predoctoral trainees who will learn together in coursework and collaborate in teams on big data-focused health research.
Program Considerations
The foundational training for these BSSR predoctoral programs should include coursework and training experiences in academia or industry, a multidisciplinary team approach, collaborative research opportunities, and should ensure adequate mentorship in advance computational methods with an emphasis on principles and practices that promote reproducibility of results. It is expected that trainees will acquire core knowledge in three overarching relevant areas in: (1) computer science/informatics, (2) statistics/mathematics, and (3) behavioral or social sciences research in a chosen health domain relevant to the NIH institutes and centers participating in this program announcement. The training should include aspects of computer science/informatics and statistics/mathematics that are directly relevant to behavioral and social sciences research in health. The critical thinking and scientific inquiry skills taught within social sciences discipline programs will provide an important context for properly interpreting findings in the new data-rich environment.
This program is not intended to support training for predoctoral candidates earning degrees in biomedical sciences, physical sciences or informatics disciplines because there are other existing programs that have provided for support for students in those disciplines (e.g., see: https://datascience.nih.gov/bd2k/announcements/training and https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/par-17-096.html).
To be deemed responsive to this RFA, applicants must propose programs designed for predoctoral trainees enrolled in Ph.D. or equivalent research doctoral degree programs leading to careers in behavioral and social sciences research in health. Trainees should be appointed in the early stages of their graduate program. Because of the great need for comprehensive knowledge and skills across three different areas of science (outlined above), trainees should be appointed for a minimum of 2 years with additional 1-2 years allowed if justified by the program plans or by specific trainee needs. Training programs are encouraged to transition trainees to other support such as individual fellowships (F31) or to research grants when feasible.
The NIH Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) intends to convene and facilitate cross-site exchanges among investigators and trainees at the awarded sites. The T32 training programs funded through this funding opportunity announcement will be required to participate in cross-site activities such as periodic training webinars and annual in-person cross-site BSSR Data Analytics T32 Program grantee meetings.Recruitment Plan to Enhance Diversity. Within the framework of the NIH’s longstanding commitment to excellence, attention must be given to recruitment of prospective trainees from underrepresented groups in the biomedical, behavioral, and clinical sciences, such as underrepresented racial or ethnic groups, individuals with disabilities, and individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Therefore, a Recruitment Plan to Enhance Diversity is a required component of this NOFO.   See SF424 Application Guide for instructions. The applicants to this training program are strongly encouraged to recruit prospective students from diverse backgrounds.  The applicant must provide a Recruitment Plan to Enhance Diversity. Include outreach strategies and activities designed to recruit prospective participants from underrepresented groups, such as those groups described in the Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity. Describe the specific efforts to be undertaken by the program and how the proposed plan reflects past experiences in recruiting individuals from underrepresented groups. Applications lacking a Recruitment Plan to Enhance Diversity will not be reviewed.
Specific Areas of Research Interest:
Each training program will be required to focus on one or more of three broad categories noted below, each of which necessitates training and competencies in advanced computational or data science analytics. Applicants should propose a training program that prepares predoctoral BSSR candidates to acquire skills in computational modeling and/or data science methods and apply them within a domain of BSSR health research of interest to one or more of the participating NIH Institutes. This training program is intended to augment the core methods courses in BSSR Ph.D. programs. Therefore, for applications to be deemed responsive to this FOA the applicants must describe plans and curricula that will offer new courses and practical experience with advanced data analytics and computational modeling approaches specifically designed to handle the kinds of big and complex data described below as applied to health research.
1.Intensive or voluminous longitudinal data.
The rapidly developing areas of mHealth, smartphone and portable sensor technologies, and increasing interconnectedness through web-enabled platforms has made it possible to continuously collect real-time data and perform intensive longitudinal assessments of individuals in their natural environments, oftentimes in an unobtrusive manner. These data collection tools offer new possibilities for detailed surveillance and epidemiology research, but also for etiological research that can inform intervention development research. In this space, personal electronic health record or EHR data reflects a special case of intensive longitudinal data that is increasingly available for use in behavioral research. However, EHR data is often not necessarily collected for research purposes and is often fraught with missing data or other computationally relevant problems, and its use may require a complex understanding of HIPAA or other regulatory rules that affect use reporting.
Intensive data capture technologies offer the promise for prevention and treatment approaches to be studied, optimized, and tailored based in part on real-time data collected from smartphones, wearable bio sensors, electronic health records, personal health records, and other sources of frequent patient reported outcomes. Behavioral and biobehavioral interventions for prevention and treatment are important tools for dealing with drug and alcohol abuse, mental illnesses, HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis C, smoking cessation, weight management, diabetes management, cancer prevention, and to help with monitoring and managing symptoms from acute and chronic conditions such as pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, impaired cognition, disordered mood, appetite, and any number of additional possible health applications.
The next generation behavioral and social scientists who wish to work with these kinds of voluminous longitudinal datasets will require knowledge of high volume data curation and analysis approaches for handling intensive longitudinal data including methods for verification, replication, validation, harmonization, and computational modeling such as non-frequentist approaches to treatment effect estimation or analytic models for individualized patient decision support and optimized interventions.
2. Internet, commercial, and administrative records data.
Social media platforms, internet data sources, crowdsourcing and citizen science data collections, retail purchasing tracking databases, and many other electronic administrative or commercial records of behavioral and social data are experiencing unprecedented worldwide growth. Digital health care administrative data from patients, providers, and insurers is also becoming more readily available for behavioral and social science inquiry in many areas of health.
Since much of this data is often behavioral, there is a great need for trained behavioral and social scientists to help curate, mine, link, and analyze social media data, web-based text, image and video data, passively collected internet or cellphone data, crowdsourced data, product purchasing data, and health administrative data for the purposes of health research. Some notable examples of heath studies involving web and social media data have included: infectious disease surveillance, monitoring of adverse reactions caused by medications, studying the availability of and interest in various nicotine and tobacco products, tracking trends in alcohol use and problem drinking, monitoring prescription drug abuse, predicting asthma prevalence, real-time monitoring of suicide risk factors, analyzing food consumption patterns, studying seasonal patterns in weight loss, physical activity and other fitness goals. Relevant examples of research involving administrative records, includes: analyzing insurance claims databases to identify patterns of prescription seeking including fraudulent activity such as doctor shopping for prescription opioids, using organizational and clinical performance data to study mental health care service systems outcomes and costs, or using hospital administrative datasets to predict patient risk of readmissions or mortality and identify system level levers for improvement in outcomes.
Computer scientists have developed many innovative approaches for handling complex text, image, video, and networked internet or social media data, and for curating and coding complex administrative datasets. The next generation behavioral and social scientists would benefit from training in these areas. Advances in automated data processing including algorithms from machine learning, text mining, data mining, artificial intelligence or natural language processing, and innovations in computational modeling all present possibilities for utilizing these voluminous data sources for public health monitoring, surveillance, or even as platforms for targeting at risk populations with tailored health messaging and personalized real-time interventions.
3. High-density, large sample or population level agency databases.
Federal and State agencies play a central role in the collection of a wide array of public and administrative data — vital statistics on health, transportation, commerce, finance, agriculture, and more. Much of this information is gathered by statistical agencies, but smaller organizations — for example, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Army Corps of Engineers and USAID — also gather important information. The quantity of available microdata from sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and other international statistical agencies and historical sources available for population research is exploding. Complete census enumerations and other high-density samples offer rich geographic detail of the world’s population over many decades, creating unique sources for population health research inquiry. Vast troves of microdata in concert with new computational and data science technologies provide the potential to transform the spatiotemporal analysis of demographic behavior, economic activity, for the purposes of health research. Commercial vendors and university-based research data repositories are also offering researchers access to large troves of U.S. and international datasets that can be merged, linked, and utilized to study population health. Some notable examples include, but are not limited to: the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) (https://usa.ipums.org/usa/), the CDC health-related datasets, including the National Death Index data (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nchs_for_you/researchers.htm), Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) data (https://www.resdac.org/cms-data/request/cms-virtual-research-data-center), the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) National Longitudinal Surveys datasets (https://www.bls.gov/nls/).
The possible topics for health research inquiry with these kinds of big data are nearly limitless. Examples include: projects that measure costs and benefits or changes in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs, studies that examine key factors such as the impact of population aging, health care cost growth, programmatic changes, and uncertainty on various health and services forecasts, projects that examine the complex causal relationships between race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status and health and morbidity across the life course, analysis of alternative models for coordinating care delivery in complex health care systems, including accountable care organizations, medical homes, or through behavioral treatment systems of care including estimation of clinical and economic outcomes.
The next generation behavioral and social scientists interested in properly curating, linking, mining and combining these kinds of complex large sample datasets for research purposes will require specific data science and computational training. Because inferential statistics developed for small sample surveys are inappropriate for analyzing entire populations with billions of records behavioral and social sciences, trainees interested in these datasets will require training in innovative computational and mathematical modeling approaches, in techniques for data mining and harmonization, and in methods for dealing with unmeasured heterogeneity.
Primary Organizational Focus of the Training Program:  Multiple PDs/PIs are allowed and encouraged.
This funding opportunity announcement requires applicants to assemble an interdisciplinary team of scientific mentors to design and direct a training program. Applications must include mentors from relevant behavioral and social sciences research (BSSR) disciplines such as psychology, sociology, economics, anthropology, communication studies, or public health as well as experts in computational or data science analysis approaches from relevant disciplines such as engineering, computer science, applied mathematics, statistics, or physics departments. All programs should aim to provide predoctoral level instruction and practical experience in advanced data analytics relevant to research in domains of health best suited for BSSR inquiry. Integration with training in subdisciplines relevant to NIH institutes (e.g., health psychology, medical anthropology, medical sociology, health economics) is strongly encouraged. Applicant programs should take advantage of opportunities to engage multiple departments within a university or multiple institutions within proximity to maximize training opportunities. Ideally the trainees will have at least two main mentors who represent completely different areas of expertise to foster a truly cross-disciplinary training experience (e.g., one mentor would be from a behavioral or social science domain and one mentor would be in a computer science or informatics domain).
NIH strongly encourages institutions with expertise in the three areas discussed above who have not previously received training grants from NIH to apply. NIH also encourages institutions that currently have multiple NIH training grants and who wish now to apply for this training grant program to consider drawing on and taking advantage of existing training activities, through collaborative approaches to expand beyond what their current training programs offer to create a unique, effective data analytics training program and one which can augment the training of people in content areas relevant to NIH institutes. In this regard, proposed training programs may complement other ongoing research training and career development programs at the applicant institution; however, the research training experiences for this new program must be distinct from those currently receiving Federal support or that already exist at the applicant institution. The purpose is to create an entirely new predoctoral training program that is not presently available to BSSR students at the applicant institution. Current P50 Program Directors or applicants at institutions with NIH center grant awards or other programmatic awards such as Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) awards who wish to apply for this program are encouraged to describe how these other awards will be used to provide professional development opportunities or serve as a research hub for these new predoctoral trainees.
Institutional research training grants must be used to support a program of full-time research training. The program may not be used to support studies leading to M.D., D.D.S., or other clinical, health-professional training. Short-term training is not intended. Research training programs solely for short-term research training should not apply to this announcement.
Applicants are strongly encouraged to contact the Scientific/Research Contacts in advance to discuss your application for its overall relevance and responsiveness to this OBSSR led training program and to its specific relevance for the interests of the participating ICs (see Section VII., Agency Contacts). Examples of the training focus for each of the participating ICs includes:
National Cancer Institute (NCI):
The NCI is interested in utilizing computational modeling and/or data science methods to understand the predictors, mediators and moderators of behavior including outcomes such as tobacco use, sedentary behavior, physical activity, sun safety, alcohol use, medication adherence and diet/nutrition. In addition, training in multi-level models that examine the effects of multiple and potentially interacting factors ranging from biology to the built environment and the impact of policy on behavior are encouraged. Training in newly established data collection efforts, including (but not limited to) crowdsourcing and citizen science, wearables, sensors, smartphones and the internet of things are encouraged. Training in techniques to merge and/or link different data sets to answer novel cancer control-related research questions are also a priority.
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI):
NHLBI supports programs that provide data science training to behavioral and social science fellows in research areas pertaining to the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) disorders , as well as the promotion of health in these areas, both domestically and internationally. NHLBI also has interests in research that addresses social determinants of health (SDoH) and health inequities, HLBS prevention and promotion across the lifespan, resilience in HLBS disease, and implementation research of proven-effective, evidence-based interventions in clinical, community, or other settings for the prevention and treatment of HLBS. Details of NHLBI’s research priorities are provided in the NHLBI Strategic Vision Plan.
For data science opportunities, BioData Catalyst (BDC), is a cloud-based platform developed by the NHLBI. It hosts a wealth of HLBS research data and provides tools for data analysis. It fosters an ecosystem where researchers can access, share, and work collaboratively on these data sets that include TOPMed and the NIH database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP). The NHLBI Biologic Specimen and Data Repository (BioLINCC) has a myriad of cohort studies data (MESA, JHS, CARDIA, FHS, HCHS, etc.).   T32 programs could leverage these platforms to provide trainees with hands-on experience in working with large-scale, real-world data, and in using cutting-edge data analysis tools.
Training should include a multidisciplinary mentor team (BSSR and Data Science) and a comprehensive approach from data collection and management (including data privacy and security) to advanced data analytical strategies and techniques. These can include, but are not limited to, training in: 1) collection of dynamic, longitudinal data in real-time with wearables, sensors, and smartphones; 2) data collection through information sharing platforms and social media; 3) in-depth analysis of existing study databases; 4) data harmonization, integration, and linking of data across studies or diverse data sources; and 5) data mining, data visualization, pattern recognition, simulation modeling and systems science to address the prevention and treatment of HLBS disease. Data analyses from multi-level, adaptive, or other complex technological interventions are also encouraged. Training in analytical strategies to understand the influence and interactions of SDoH at multiple levels to inform the development of multilevel interventions to reduce inequities in HLBS diseases are encouraged. Research training that examines the effects of multiple and potentially interacting factors ranging from genetics, microbiome, psychosocial, health behaviors, dietary patterns, circadian rhythm, SDoH, neighborhood geographic information systems (GIS), and HLBS-related health policies are also encouraged. Advances in systems science, including computational biology, cohort datasets, machine learning, big data, omics (genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, etc.), and environmental data could be harnessed for training opportunities in HLBS preventive prediction.
NHLBI is also interested in training programs that are invested in the recruitment of prospective researcher applicants from diverse backgrounds, including those from groups underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral, and clinical sciences, such as  underrepresented racial or ethnic groups , individuals with disabilities, and individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds.
Examples of training areas of interest:
<ul><li>Training on how to use spatial information, county-level and other data to assess multi-level SDoH, historical and current policies that maintain or exacerbate HLBS inequities.</li><li>Training on analysis and integration of multiple data types, such as the dynamics of the social exposome over the lifespan to understand the impact on HLBS outcomes and best periods in the lifespan to intervene.</li><li>Training in methods to streamline raw data from research- or consumer-grade wearable devices and harmonize metrics across different fields (e.g., physical activity and sleep) to leverage in intervention research.</li><li>Training on how to leverage simulated interventions and predictive models in the real world to reduce HLBS disease.</li><li>Training on using predictive models from big data analytics, to identify what dietary patterns are appropriate for individuals with HLBS diseases and conditions, including dietary timing and circadian control of various disease states (e.g., circadian rhythm of blood pressure and its control).</li></ul>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD):
NICHD supports training programs in research areas relevant to the institute’s scientific objectives.  The mission of NICHD is to ensure that every person is born healthy and wanted, that women suffer no harmful effects from reproductive processes, and that all children have the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives. The institute also aims to ensure the health, productivity, independence, and well-being of people through optimal rehabilitation. Information on NICHD’s extramural branches and programs can be found at: https://www.nichd.nih.gov/about/org/der/branches. For this RFA, NICHD encourages applications seeking to incorporate advanced data analytics into new training programs within the scope of NICHD’s behavioral and social science portfolio.

National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA):
NIDA is interested in training that supports advanced analytic methods for complex and intensive social and behavioral data related to drug use, addiction and the intersection of drug addiction, HIV, and other physical and mental health comorbidities, and methods for enhancing use of data to inform action.
Such training can include but is not limited to the use of new analytic tools and techniques to model complex social and behavioral processes that contribute to initiation and escalation of drug use and drug addiction to inform prevention and treatment services; development or enhancement of drug addiction prevention and clinical assessment tools; harmonization and/or integration of data across studies and across heterogenous data (e.g., behavioral data with biological/biometric data); exploring methods to detect and eliminate data and/or algorithmic bias; data analysis from multi-level, adaptive, or other complex intervention trials; and development of tools to enhance use of data for decision making across settings (e.g., public health, health care, community services).
NIDA supports the utilization of robust methods to unpack administrative data, geospatial data, electronic health records, clinical trials data, social network data, social media data, data from personal devices, and data from public sources that can contribute to understanding the development, treatment, and prevention of substance use and substance use disorders. NIDA also has an interest in data analyses relevant to drug prevention and treatment services and high-priority HIV/AIDS research (see https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-20-018.html). Investigators are encouraged to consider using data sets made available through the National Addiction and HIV Data Archive Program (NAHDAP). NIDA’s research priorities are detailed in the NIDA Strategic Plan for 2022-2026.
National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH):
NIMH encourages doctoral candidates in the social and behavioral sciences to develop the capacity to apply advanced data analytics to mental health research studies in areas that include but are not limited to: 1) reducing disparities in mental health service delivery and outcomes, 2) detecting and responding to severe mental illness and severe emotional disturbances at an early stage, 3) preventing suicide and self-harm and 4) informing new targets for and timing of preventive and treatment interventions and services for psychiatric disorders. Examples of large datasets that might be valuable for training purposes include but are not limited to data from: electronic health records (EHRs); public and commercial insurance claims and other administrative databases; automated collection via smartphones, wearables, or sensors; internet or device use (e.g., browser history, social media use and content), social and economic datasets available for population health research; and publicly available datasets from the NIMH Data Archive and other repositories. The Division of AIDS Research at NIMH is committed to enhancing workforce development and training opportunities in biostatistics and data science to advance health equity research in HIV prevention and treatment (see NOT-MH-23-350).

Other Award Budget Information
Stipends, Tuition, and Fees 
Kirschstein-NRSA awards provide stipends as a subsistence allowance to help defray living expenses during the research training experience.
NIH will contribute to the combined cost of tuition and fees at the rate in place at the time of award.
Stipend levels, as well as funding amounts for tuition and fees and the institutional allowance are announced annually in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts, and are also posted on the Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) webpage.
Travel for trainees to attend scientific meetings and workshops that the institution determines to be necessary for the individual’s research training experience is an allowable expense for predoctoral and postdoctoral trainees. This includes trainees on short-term appointments. Trainees must be appointed to the training grant at the time of the actual travel for this to be an allowable cost.
Scholars are those individuals who benefit from the proposed activities and experiences involved in the career development program. Scholar costs must be justified as specifically required for the proposed career development program and based on institutional policies for salaries paid to individuals in similar positions, regardless of the source of funds. These expenses must be itemized in the proposed budget.
Training Related Expenses 
NIH will provide funds to help defray other research training expenses, such as health insurance, staff salaries, consultant costs, equipment, research supplies, and faculty/staff travel directly related to the research training program. The most recent levels of training related expenses are announced annually in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts, and are also posted on the Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) webpage.
Consultant costs, equipment, supplies, travel for key persons, and other program-related expenses may be included in the proposed budget. These expenses must be justified as specifically required by the proposed program and must not duplicate items generally available at the applicant institution.
Indirect Costs (also known as Facilities &amp; Administrative [F&amp;A] Costs) are reimbursed at 8% of modified total direct costs (exclusive of tuition and fees, consortium costs in excess of $25,000, and expenditures for equipment), rather than on the basis of a negotiated rate agreement.
NIH grants policies as described in the NIH Grants Policy Statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made from this NOFO.

Trainees
The individual to be trained must be a citizen or a noncitizen national of the United States or have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time of appointment. Additional details on citizenship, training period, and aggregate duration of support are available in the NIH Grants Policy Statement.
All trainees are required to pursue their research training full time, normally defined as 40 hours per week, or as specified by the sponsoring institution in accordance with its own policies. Appointments are normally made in 12-month increments, and no trainee may be appointed for less than 9 months during the initial period of appointment, except with prior approval of the awarding unit, or when trainees are appointed to approved, short-term training positions.
The predoctoral trainees must be enrolled in a program leading to a Ph.D. or in an equivalent research doctoral degree program leading to a career in behavioral and social sciences research in health.
This program is not intended to support training for predoctoral candidates earning degrees in biomedical and physical sciences because there are other existing T32 programs that provide for support for students in those disciplines. To be deemed responsive to this RFA, applicants must propose programs designed for predoctoral trainees enrolled in Ph.D. or equivalent research doctoral degree programs leading to careers in behavioral and social sciences research in health.
Trainees should be appointed in the early stages of their graduate program. Because of the great need for comprehensive knowledge and skills trainees should be appointed for a minimum of 2 years with additional 1-2 years allowed as justified by the program plans. Training programs are encouraged to transition trainees to other support such as individual fellowships (F31) or to research grants when feasible.

Training Program
Program Plan
Proposed Training. 
The PD/PI should describe program activities intended to develop the working knowledge needed for trainees to select among and prepare for the next step in varied research career options available in the biomedical workforce. For example, programs should provide all trainees with instruction and training in oral and written presentation and in skills needed to apply for individual fellowship or grant support. All postdoctoral trainees should also be provided with instruction in laboratory and project management.
For programs that propose short-term training, any didactic training must be well structured and appropriately justified for the duration of the training experience. Short-term trainees must have the opportunity to carry out supervised biomedical, behavioral, or clinical research with the primary objective of developing or enhancing their research skills and knowledge in preparation for a health-related research career.
For renewal applications, highlight how the training program has evolved in response to changes in relevant scientific and technical knowledge, educational practices, and to evaluation of the training program.
​​​​​Plan for Instruction in the Responsible Conduct of Research
Individuals are required to comply with the instructions for Plan for Instruction in the Responsible Conduct of Research as provided in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide.
Proposed Training.
The PD/PI should describe program activities intended to develop the working knowledge needed for trainees to select among and prepare for the next step in varied research career options available in the workforce. For example, programs should provide all trainees with instruction and training in oral and written presentation and in skills needed to apply for individual fellowship or grant support.
The training program should be designed to ensure that by the end of the training period, trainees would have received sufficient breadth in knowledge and skills in the areas that complement their undergraduate degree as well as depth in complementary data science or computational modeling areas. Because trainees will enter the program with different knowledge and skill sets, a trainee's program may have to be customized.
Common elements of a successful training program should include the following:
Courses: Describe how the courses will expose trainees to the basic concepts and working knowledge in the scientific areas of advanced data analytics or computational modeling as well as a behavioral or social sciences research discipline. It is incumbent on the applicant to define a set of core concepts that graduating students will master, even if their research projects are highly specialized.
Team Science Approach to Problem Solving: Describe how the trainees will be provided with opportunities to work together in teams or as part of an interdisciplinary research group effort to solve with data analysis challenges. Describe how problem-based learning through a team approach be considered in the design of a core curriculum. Describe how the trainees will learn about rigorous experimental design and transparency to enhance reproducibility of results in teams.
Rotations and External Internships: Rotations are widely recognized as effective means to introduce students to the broadest range of the myriad types of data sets that are a challenge to data science. For example, describe how the training program will offer rotations in computer or in clinical laboratories after trainees have had sufficient course work to gain basic applications of their data science training in relevant areas. As another example, programs can describe experiences in academic, industrial, and other relevant settings that may be provided for trainees to introduce them to a variety of creative approaches to conducting complex data research.
Joint Mentorship: Describe how the program will structure arrangements for joint mentorship of trainees and for peer-to-peer mentoring between more senior trainees and more junior trainees. One way to enhance training and communication among disciplines is for trainees to have mentors from more than one of the interdisciplinary scientific areas (computer science, statistics, and the behavioral or social sciences). Ideally trainees will have at least two main mentors who represent completely different areas of expertise to foster a truly cross-disciplinary training experience (e.g., one mentor would be from a behavioral or social science domain and one mentor would be in a computer science or informatics domain).
Reproducibility of Research Results: Describe how the training program will emphasize practices that promote the reproducibility of results, such as scientific and rigorous design and implementation of experiments, usage of analysis methods based on scientifically sound statistical principles, and the sharing of code, data, protocols, and other information necessary for reproducing research.
Forums for Intellectual Exchanges: It is important for trainees to have opportunities to interact with other trainees and faculty from other data analytic training programs to discuss published articles and research in progress and to interact with visiting scholars. Describe the planned mechanisms for fostering intellectual exchanges such as journal clubs; seminars by students, faculty, and outside speakers; annual retreats; and the annual cross-site BSSR Data Analytics T32 Program grantee meetings.
Individual Development Plans (IDP): Describe the IDP plans for the training program. Each student is encouraged to have an IDP in place at the beginning of their appointment to the program. The IDP should be developed jointly by the trainee and her/his mentors and should be reviewed at a minimum annually (https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-13-093.html). It is expected that at some point during the training, appointees should have the opportunity to conduct dissertation research in areas of behavioral and social sciences health research involving advanced data science analytics or computational modeling.
If funds for curriculum development are requested, the applicant must describe the new courses, how they will differ from and build upon existing ones, and how they utilize appropriate technology. The applicant should describe how course materials will be disseminated and shared widely and how they can be used, modified, and updated by others.
Program Administration.
Institutions with existing programs must explain what distinguishes this program from the others already in existence, how their programs will synergize with one another, if applicable, and make it clear that the pool of faculty, potential scholars, and resources are robust enough to support additional programs.
Describe the strengths, leadership and administrative skills, training experience, scientific expertise, and active research of the PD/PI. Relate these strengths to the proposed management of the training program. Describe the planned strategy and administrative structure to be used to oversee and monitor the program. If there are multiple PDs/PIs, then the plan for Program Administration is expected to synergize with the ""Multiple PD/PI Leadership Plan"" section of the application.
Program Faculty.
The application must include information about the program faculty who will serve as preceptors/mentors and, if relevant, distinguish between faculty members who will serve as primary mentors and those who have other roles. Describe the complementary expertise and experiences of the program faculty as they relate specifically to the programmatic structure and goals of the program. Describe expectations for faculty participation in programmatic activities beyond training within their labs. Describe the involvement of participating mentors in training students to conduct their research with quantitative rigor. For renewal applications, highlight how the training program has evolved in response to changes in relevant scientific and technical knowledge, educational practices, and to evaluation of the training program. 
Institutional Environment and Commitment to the Program
The sponsoring institution must assure support for the proposed program including assurance that sufficient time will be allowed for the PDs/PIs and other Program Faculty to contribute to the proposed program, and that there will be protected time for scholars (9 person months, equivalent to 75%) selected for the program.

If a recipient is successful and receives a Notice of Award, in accepting the award, the recipient agrees that any activities under the award are subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other Department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions.
If a recipient receives an award, the recipient must follow all applicable nondiscrimination laws. The recipient agrees to this when registering in SAM.gov. The recipient must also submit an Assurance of Compliance (HHS-690). To learn more, see the HHS Office for Civil Rights website.
HHS recognizes that NIH research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this NOFO.
In accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) requirements. FAPIIS requires Federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS) prior to making an award. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a Federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR Part 200.206 “Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.
Institutional NRSA training grants must be administered in accordance with the current NRSA section of the NIH Grants Policy Statement - Institutional Research Training Grants.
The taxability of stipends is described in the NIH Grants Policy Statement. Policies regarding the Ruth L. Kirschstein-NRSA payback obligation are explained in the NIH Grants Policy Statement.
As specified in the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993, Kirschstein-NRSA recipients incur a service payback obligation for the first 12 months of postdoctoral support. Policies regarding the Ruth L. Kirschstein-NRSA payback obligation are explained in the NIH Grants Policy Statement; and more details are in the Frequently Asked Questions. Officials at the recipient institution have the responsibility of explaining the terms of the payback requirements to all prospective trainees before appointment to the training grant. Additionally, all trainees recruited into the training program should be provided with information related to the career options that might be available when they complete the program. The suitability of such career options as methods to satisfy the NRSA service payback obligation should be discussed.
Inventions and Copyrights
Awards made primarily for educational purposes are exempted from the PHS invention requirements and thus invention reporting is not required, as described in the NIH Grants Policy Statement.

Meg Wingerter,Colorado senators propose new fee on alcohol producers to fund addiction treatment and recovery programs,"Colorado consistently has one of the highest rates of deaths related to excessive drinking in the country, as well as some of the lowest taxes.",https://www.denverpost.com/2024/03/13/colorado-legislature-alcohol-fee-addiction/,https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/TDP-L-ALCOHOL-015.jpg?w=1024&h=683,2024-03-13T12:00:37Z,"A bill set to be unveiled in the Colorado legislature would levy a new fee on businesses that produce alcoholic beverages, then direct tens of millions of dollars collected each year to addiction treatment and recovery programs.
Sen. Kevin Priola, a Democrat from Henderson, said he plans to introduce legislation Wednesday to create a “state enterprise” that would collect a fee from alcohol producers and wholesalers, with some exceptions for small companies.
The enterprise is expected to generate more than $100 million a year, and would funnel 80% of that money toward alcohol addiction treatment and recovery programs, according to the bill’s sponsors. Funds also would go toward prevention programs, harm reduction, impaired driving enforcement, or services for people born with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and to offset the cost of collecting the fee and doling out the grants.
Colorado consistently has one of the highest rates of deaths related to excessive drinking in the country, as The Denver Post illustrated in a four-part series earlier this year that examined alcohol’s impact on public health in the state.
By the most conservative count, which includes only deaths from organ damage by alcohol and complications of withdrawal, drinking killed 1,547 people in Colorado in 2022. Thats more than a 50% increase compared to 2018, and the actual toll may be twice as high, because drinking increases the risk of multiple cancers and heart problems.
About two-thirds of people seeking substance-use disorder treatment in Colorado list alcohol as either their primary problem or one drug among several that they misuse, Priola said.
“Not only is it one of the largest substance-use disorders Coloradans are struggling with, it’s growing,” he said.
The Colorado Brewers Guild said it couldn’t comment on pending legislation, but questioned funding addiction treatment through an alcohol fee, particularly since beer consumption has gradually declined in recent years.
“Hundreds of thousands of Coloradoans responsibly enjoy our craft beer as part of an active and social lifestyle,” the guild said in a statement.
The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States said it estimated that a new fee would reduce sales in Colorado by $220 million and cost 2,600 jobs, without reducing excessive alcohol use. In a statement, the group said it would support efforts to screen patients for alcohol misuse and to refer them to treatment.
“Penalizing responsible alcohol consumers and an already struggling hospitality industry while failing to address the actual problem makes no sense,” the statement said.
While many people do enjoy alcohol without negative effects, it is an addictive product and people who have been drinking excessively can’t always stop, Priola said. The fee would help offset some of the societal costs of unhealthy drinking, he said.
In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that unhealthy alcohol use cost Colorado about $5 billion, mostly due to lost productivity.
“I would argue that this is personal responsibility for the industry,” he said.
State enterprises essentially allow the legislature to avoid the cumbersome process of asking voters for a tax increase as required by the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, within certain bounds. While they can receive some state and local revenue, enterprises act like government-owned businesses, charging fees for a service — though not always one that entities paying the fee can opt out of. For example, a state enterprise collects a fee on Colorado hospitals and uses that money to draw down federal funds for health care.
Usually, an enterprise would have to go on the ballot if it realistically could collect more than $100 million in its first five years, but the bill’s language would exempt the Alcohol Impact Enterprise Fund because it addresses an urgent public health need, said co-sponsor Sen. Chris Hansen, a Denver Democrat.
The model is similar to how the state mitigates the effects of other legal, but potentially addictive, industries, Hansen said.
“This is close to what we do with marijuana. It’s what we do with problem gambling,” he said.
Priola said he and others have been working on the idea for at least three years, but the timing finally seems right with federal COVID-19 relief funds drying up. The enterprise would continue indefinitely, unlike federal funds, and the legislature couldn’t take money from it to balance the general budget in difficult years, he said.
“We’re trying to create a sustainable funding source,” he said.
The bill lays out fees of 16 cents for every gallon of beer or hard cider; 15 cents for every liter of wine; and $1.21 for every liter of spirits. The enterprise’s board could vote to raise the fees every two years, based on the inflation rate, population growth and increases in alcohol consumption.
Assuming that manufacturers and wholesalers pass on the fee entirely, the combined excise taxes and fees on a typical can of beer would rise from about 0.7 cents to about 1.5 cents, Hansen said.
“For consumers, they are likely to not notice this at all,” he said.
Colorado would still be near the middle of the states on alcohol-specific taxes and fees, Priola said. The state currently has some of the lowest excise taxes on alcohol in the country. While higher taxes aren’t a guarantee that people will drink less, drunken driving accidents dropped the last time the federal government raised its taxes.
José Esquibel, a longtime member of the Colorado Substance Abuse Trend and Response Task Force who consulted with the senators, said the model they’re proposing has precedents in how states responded to the opioid crisis of the mid-2000s. Minnesota increased the licensing fees it requires of opioid manufacturers that sell their products in the state, and New York added a per-milligram tax on prescribed opioids.
The proposed increase is small enough that it isn’t likely to drive people to reduce their drinking, but it will give the state more resources to respond, Esquibel said. Coming up with a stable funding source is particularly important for services that health insurance doesn’t cover, like prevention programs and support for people in recovery, he said.
“People may go through a treatment program for a smaller amount of time,” he said. “They’re going to be in recovery for the rest of their lives.”

A variety of industry sites, such as those involved with hazardous waste cleanup, remedial action, and transportation-related emergency response may pose severe health and safety concerns to workers and the surrounding communities. These sites contain many hazardous substances, sometimes unknown, and a site maybe uncontrolled. A major goal of the Worker Training Program (WTP) is to support institutional competency-building for the development and delivery of model training and education programs.

Purpose
NIEHS Worker Training Program (WTP) intends to support the development of model programs for the training and education of workers engaged in activities related to hazardous materials and waste generation, removal, containment, transportation, and emergency response. The major objective of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to prevent work-related harm by assisting in the training of workers on how best to identify and protect themselves and their communities from exposure to hazardous materials encountered during hazardous waste operations, hazardous materials' transportation, environmental restoration of contaminated facilities or chemical emergency response. A variety of sites, such as those involved with chemical waste cleanup and remedial action and transportation-related chemical emergency response, may pose severe health and safety concerns to workers and the surrounding communities. These sites are often characterized by the multiplicity of substances present, the presence of unknown substances, and the general uncontrolled condition of the site. A major goal of this program is to support grant recipient organizations to provide appropriate model training and education programs to hazardous materials and waste workers.
Background
The Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), Section126(g), authorizes an assistance program for training and education of workers engaged in activities related to hazardous waste generation, removal, containment or emergency response and hazardous materials transportation and emergency response. The United States Congress assigned responsibility for administering this program to the NIEHS, an Institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) under the US Department of Health and Human Services (US DHHS). This NOFO lists three distinct program areas: Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program (HWWTP), the Environmental Career Worker Training Program (ECWTP), and the Hazmat Disaster Preparedness Training Program (HDPTP).  The core program is the HWWTP and is required in order to add the other two optional programs.
Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program (HWWTP)
Hazardous material and waste workers include workers engaged in active and inactive waste treatment, storage and disposal, hazardous waste generation, clean up and remedial action, emergency response, and workers engaged in hazardous materials transportation including safe loading, unloading, handling, and storage. Worker populations for this training include those covered by requirements of Federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration (Code of Federal Regulations, Title 29, Part 1910) and Environmental Protection Agency (CFR, Title 40, Part 311) standards for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response, regulations governing the NIEHS Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program (CFR, Title 42, Part 65), as well as hazardous materials transportation workers regulated by the US Department of Transportation (49 CFR 171-177).
Since 1987 of the Superfund WTP (FY 1987-2023), the HWWTP has supported 17-20 primary grant recipients. WTP funding granted about 7,775 courses that were provided to more than 129,277 workers with over 1.1 million contact hours from June 1, 2022, to May 31, 2023. More than 4.7 million workers have been enrolled in training courses since  program inception in 1987. The most contact hours in 2023 were in General Construction Safety courses, followed by Confined Space and Hazard Communication. This training is the result of the support that WTP has established among a national network of more than 100 academic institutions, labor-based safety programs, and other nonprofit organizations that deliver high-quality, peer-reviewed safety and health curricula to hazardous waste workers and emergency responders in every region of the United States. More information about the grant recipients and descriptions of all NIEHS WTP Programs can be found on the WTP website.
Environmental Career Worker Training Program (ECWTP)
 There is evidence to support that communities disadvantaged by social economic status, with lack of access to resources such as quality schools and healthcare and living in or near contaminated or polluted areas, face greater risk of exposure to environmental hazards. ECWTP seeks to enrich and change the lives of people from such communities by increasing training and education to promote a sustainable environmental career path for workers in hazardous materials handling, waste, construction, environmental remediation, and other emerging industries. The term disadvantaged refers to populations sharing a particular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, that have been systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of economic, social, and civic life. For the WTP this includes workers, especially those with less formal education and/or limited English proficiency, that are exposed to environmental contamination, and/or have limited access to training. The ECWTP, formerly known as the Minority Worker Training Program, was established in 1995 to provide a series of national pilot programs to test a range of strategies for the recruitment and training of persons from vulnerable and disadvantaged communities. These are individuals who live near hazardous waste sites or in a community at risk of exposure from contaminated properties who wish to work in the environmental field. The program represents a broad geographic distribution and reaches numerous populations in high-risk contaminated areas across the United States and has reached over 30 communities trained across 20 states and the District of Columbia with over 200 different community-based organizations. 
The promotion of long-lasting and effective partnerships is a critical piece of the program, in terms of providing supportive services and pathways to employment, for example by referrals, first-hire ordinances, pre-apprenticeship programs, and community benefit agreements. The different programs provide pre-employment job training, including literacy, life skills, environmental preparation, green jobs  and other related courses, construction skills training, environmental worker training including hazardous waste, asbestos and lead abatement training,  safety and health training, and hands-on technical skills training. Some training also includes enrollment in apprenticeship and workforce development programs for construction and environmental remediation worker training. In addition, particular focus is placed on establishing a program of mentoring. ECWTP promotes partnerships or sub-agreements with academic and other institutions,  public schools, and community-based organizations located in or near the impacted area to provide pre-math, science or other related education to program participants prior to or concurrent with entry into the training program. For FY 2023, the program trained 657 individuals with 489 employed for an outstanding job placement rate of 74%. Since the program began, we have trained 14,678 students with 10,284 obtaining jobs and an overall job placement rate of 72%.
There are important guidance documents that describe the successes of the NIEHS Worker Training Program. Guidance on How to Achieve Successes and Best Practices Report provides a detailed assessment of the development of the program, key findings, best practices for implementation and success, short- and long-term recommendations, and numerous case studies. The history of the program and its commitment towards environmental justice is captured in the article Government Program Celebrates 25 Years of Commitment to Environmental Justice Movement. 
The 2015 report The Economic Impact of the Environmental Career Worker Training Program showed an annual federal investment of $3.5 million in ECWTP generates a $100 million return from 2005 to 2013 at a total of $1.79 billion. An updated report for the period of 2014-2022, Impact Evaluation of Workplace Development in Disadvantaged Communities: The NIEHS ECWTP found that the program produced a 28 times return on annual federal investment. The economists who authored the reports found fiscal benefits in the program’s positive effect on earnings that also lead to additional revenue through taxes, reduced costs related to workplace injury, a reduction in hiring costs for businesses, decreased costs related to crime, fewer social program transfers, and for the year 2020 savings related to COVID-19 pandemic unemployment.  Qualitative results illustrate societal benefits to program participants. Some key themes found that ECWTP has fostered and supported partnerships among recipients and leaders within their communities, leading to recruitment and job placement of trainees; and training cohorts nurture trainees with skills that build confidence and empowerment. 
We expanded our focus on Environmental Justice, especially under the Environmental Career Worker Training Program, to focus on assuring cultural sensitivity, multilingual communications, and an appreciation for inclusion and diversity. Some Executive Orders that relate include EO 12898, 14008, and 14096. ECWTP was selected as a pilot program to the Justice40 Initiative. This whole-of-government initiative aims to deliver 40 percent of the overall benefits from Federal investments in climate change, clean energy, clean transportation, affordable housing, water infrastructure, workforce development, and pollution remediation to disadvantaged communities. ECWTP was selected because of its strong track record of helping unemployed, underemployed, homeless, and formerly incarcerated people find good jobs and become productive members of society.
As part of the DHHS commitment to the Brownfields Program , the NIEHS will continue to provide training under ECWTP to support training targeting brownfields communities.  Overall, these programs have achieved great success in moving workers into long-term employment including, most recently, in the area of energy retrofitting, commercial driver licenses with hazmat endorsement, and solar panel installation. 
Hazmat Disaster Preparedness Training Program (HDPTP)
NIEHS has developed a HDPTP initiative in response to the experiences and lessons learned from past and recent natural and man-made disasters. This program enhances the safety and health training of hazardous materials workers and&amp;nbsnbsp;responders by developing and delivering health and safety training to workers responding to disasters. This program, through its partnerships between grant recipients, their partners, as well as federal, state, and local agencies, aims to augment preparedness and response efforts in a wide variety of high-risk settings to ensure responders are aware of site-specific hazards and mitigation techniques prior to and during response and recovery activities. This initiative is intended to foster the development and delivery of disaster specific training programs as an extension to the HWWTP for the purpose of preparing a cadre of trained workers for prevention, response, and recovery to disasters in a wide variety of facilities and high-risk operations.
The purpose of the NIEHS HDPTP is to complement the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) various preparedness scenarios by enhancing the safety and health training capacity of hazmat workers and emergency responders to respond to terrorist incidents involving weapons of mass destruction as well as natural disasters. Under Homeland Security Presidential Directive/ HSPD–8—National Preparedness, The term First Responders was defined as emergency management, public health, clinical care, public works, and other skilled support personnel (such as equipment operators) that provide immediate support services during prevention, response, and recovery operations. Since the program started in 2005, grant recipients have responded and trained workers after major natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and man-made disasters such as the World Trade Center, Anthrax, Opioid Crises, and Deepwater Horizon Gulf Oil Spill. WTP and its grant recipients have also responded to Ebola and COVID-19.  As part of the COVID-19 response, WTP and its grant recipients were able to produce several training tools, in multiple languages, held numerous virtual workshops, developed fact sheets, conducted evaluations, and created search tools for infectious disease resources. As of 2023, supplemental COVID-19 funding from NIEHS WTP has led to 3,140 courses, 61,630 workers trained, over 172,984 total contact hours. 
NIEHS WTP supports the belief that pre-incident (preparedness) training is critical for workers who may find themselves responding to a disaster. Skilled and other support personnel (such as construction, utility, and transportation workers)along with federal, state, and local government workers and others may find themselves working on a disaster site, during the response or recovery. These populations need to understand the unique hazards that are present on a disaster site before they are deployed there. The Disaster Site Worker course (OSHA 5600) arose from clearly identified need at World Trade Center (WTC) Ground Zero and can save lives during disaster responses by providing workers who respond to disasters the critical knowledge they need to protect themselves.
Training developed under this program should complement FEMA’s National Incident Management System (NIMS) standardized incident management processes, protocols, and procedures that all responders -- Federal, state, tribal, and local -- will use to coordinate and conduct response actions. Therefore, grant recipients who plan to participate in disaster response activities should be familiar with NIMS compliance.  Background resources describing this initiative include technical Workshop reports which are available at the NIEHS Clearinghouse website:
 General Training Goals and Objectives
 With worker health and safety training, an immediate goal is to provide students with relevant information, program-solving skills, and the confidence needed to use these tools. Long-term goals of the model training programs are to assure that workers become and remain active participants in determining and improving the health and safety conditions under which they work, and that avenues are established for collaborative employer-employee relationships in creating safe workplaces. Primary prevention of disease and injury among hazardous waste workers requires heavy reliance on the use of engineering control methods, appropriate work practices and the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators and protective clothing. These approaches are highly dependent on individual workers being knowledgeable in the use and application of these approaches and understanding their limitations.
Worker safety and health training is adult learning-based, action-oriented, and results-centered. Training for workers focuses on providing knowledge and skills that can be applied in the workplace, rather than on learning for its own sake. Workers come to training with a great volume of experience, and are, in many ways, the richest resources of a training class. Successful adult education emphasizes peer-sharing activities, such as problem-solving and simulation exercises, that tap the experience of the learner. It also harnesses the motivation an adult learner brings to the classroom when they have a use for the topic and skills being taught. Successful worker training often mirrors the way people learn from each other at work. After training, workers should be able to bring what they have learned in the classroom or work-site training back to their jobs. Section 8.2: Principles of Adult Education Applicable to HAZWOPER of the Minimum Health and Safety Training Criteria: Guidance for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) and HAZWOPER-Supporting Training provides more details on this topic.
These training goals and objectives apply to all programs; however, there are specific goals and objectives restricted to the ECWTP and the HDPTP. Applications which are responsive to this NOFO must clearly delineate the training populations being targeted by specifying a discrete training plan, program resources and a segregated program budget which responds to a combination or all of the authorized NIEHS assistance programs through HWWTP, ECWTP, and the HDPTP.
HWWTP Specific Goals and Objectives
 Applicants should be familiar with SARA Section 126 requirements for training. This identifies workers to be trained based on potential exposure and health risk and requires training for personnel engaged in hazardous substance removal or other activities, such as those involved in transportation, which expose or potentially expose such workers to hazardous substances. In addition, training is required for workers who may be exposed to unique or special hazards. Different levels of training for hazardous materials, waste workers and supervisors are delineated in this section and depending on their role in the response activity training should be tailored to and specific to the hazards. For example, training described in a site safety plan based on the job hazard analysis of the site should be followed according to the standard. This program embraces an all-hazards approach to training that includes a broad range of hazardous incidents, including major natural disasters and chemical, biological, radiological, and explosive incidents. The applicability of the HAZWOPER regulation to natural disasters and explosive events would be determined by OSHA on a case-by-case basis, but the agency has previously confirmed that HAZWOPER applies broadly to chemical, biological, and radiological incidents.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services(US DHHS), which includes the NIH and the NIEHS, is a signatory to the National Response Framework (NRF), National Disaster Recovery Framework (NDRF), or the National Contingency Plan (NCP). Upon the activation by any of these plans, the NIEHS WTP may be activated to provide:
<ul><li>Training technical assistance such as instructional staff, curricula development experts, subject-matter experts, and professional staff. Safety training to worker target populations with respect to the nature and location of the incident and the hazards.</li><li>Assistance and support in the development and delivery of site-specific health and safety training through appropriately qualified WTP grant recipient instructional staff. Assistance such as respirator fit testing and distribution of personal protective equipment.</li></ul>This section on the NRF, NDRF, or NCP is also applicable to the HDPTP
 Important background information for this NOFO is available from the National Clearinghouse for Worker Safety and Health Training. This Clearinghouse, which is run by a support contractor to NIEHS, is the primary communications channel through which the WTP distributes technical reports, news updates,  and training information to its grant recipients, interested members of the hazardous waste worker-training community, and the public. The National Clearinghouse provides a database of curricula developed by current NIEHS grant recipients. In addition, program evaluation has always been a core part of the WTP mission. Many tools and resources to support evaluation implementation and assessment of program effectiveness are on the National Clearinghouse Training Evaluation web page
. Additionally, since the previous NOFO ( 
RFA-ES-19-003 
), WTP has published several reports that provide lessons learned, summaries of accomplishments, and evaluation and impact findings.
Model training programs for hazardous waste workers and emergency responders shall satisfy minimum requirements as specified in Federal OSHA rules and other related regulations which have been or may be promulgated. Training programs shall also meet the minimum requirements specified in the Minimum Health and Safety Criteria: Guidance for HAZWOPER and HAZWOPER-Supporting Training” (Minimum Criteria), updated in 2018 (2018 Minimum Criteria Guidance Summary of Changes) as a result of a NIEHS-sponsored technical workshop focused on revising critical components of the guidance. Originally issued in 1991, with revisions in 1994 and 2006, the latest document incorporated feedback and changes in the following areas: E-learning, Collateral Duty, Proficiency Assessment, Instructor Development, Evaluation, Disaster Training, Infectious Disease, and Evergreening of Curricula. Consideration should also be given to Appendix E of 29 CFR 1910.120 (59 FR 43268, August 22, 1994), which references much of the NIEHS Minimum Criteria Worker Health and Safety Training for Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response.
WTP and NIEHS have strategic planning documents that can be referenced to understand program goals, expected outcomes, and ongoing initiatives. For WTP, these documents are a 2024-2029 WTP draft strategic plan, a WTP Logic Model, and an WTP Operational Matrix. The Operational Matrix is used to track annual progress toward WTP goals and activities. The activities within the matrix link to outcomes (impacts) in the WTP Logic Model. NIEHS has a  2018-2023 Strategic Plan. WTP activities primarily fall under the NIEHS goals for Theme Two, Promoting Translation – Data to Knowledge to Action. The WTP uses the environmental sciences to reduce risk and protect worker and public health through training. WTP activities primarily fall under the NIEHS goals for Theme Two, Promoting Translation – Data to Knowledge to Action. The WTP uses the environmental sciences to reduce risk and protect worker and public health through training. NIEHS hopes to publish it s new strategic plan in 2024 and should be reviewed.
There is no limiting language regarding training coverage. Thus, the scope covers worker health protection from hazardous waste work and exposure to hazardous substances in the broadest sense.
An applicant may join with one or more nonprofit organizations in a single application and share resources in order to maximize worker group coverage, enhance the effectiveness of training, and bring together appropriate academic disciplines and talents. Such arrangements are strongly encouraged. The application must have specific plans to implement the cooperative arrangements necessary for program integration and to insure effectiveness. Detailed plans of this collaboration and budgets must be described only in the lead organization application. Specific expertise, facilities, or services to be provided by each participating member must be identified.
Awards will be made for direct student and worker trainer training, technical support of training, and training program evaluation. It is believed that adequate curricula and training materials exist for worker training that can be adapted with minimal effort. Means of multiplying training are also encouraged to meet the need; thus, programs such as effective train-the-trainer programs are encouraged. Programs targeted to multi-state and nationwide coverage to reach wider worker populations will be given preference in funding.
Applications will not be considered that cover municipalities or other jurisdictions covering fewer than two states. Since this program restricts indirect costs to 8%, applicants are also strongly encouraged to develop plans to generate program income to assist in supporting efforts under the HWWT and HDPTP components.
WTP recognizes that within proposed target populations there are workers who have less formal education or have limited English proficiency. Applicants are encouraged to consider how to address the language and cultural needs of these workers so that they are engaged in learning and can understand and act on the health and safety information being taught to them.
The inclusion of institutions and organizations that have historical involvement and expertise in responding to environmental justice issues is also strongly encouraged. Participation of institutions and community-based organizations from disadvantaged or vulnerable communities may include the:
<ul><li>Adaptation of curricula to address occupational health disparities and environmental justice concerns</li><li>Development of training programs that outreach to environmentally disadvantaged groups and Limited English Proficient populations</li><li>Delivery of high-quality training that can augment efforts to promote toxic use reduction, emergency preparedness in the community, chemical process safety and pollution prevention; and</li><li>Expansion of partnerships to disaster volunteers, communities surrounding a disaster site, and other vulnerable populations such as tribal communities.</li></ul>Information regarding the NIEHS WTP Environmental Justice Accomplishments are described in the report entitled Environmental Justice and Hazardous Waste Worker Training Programs: 15 Years of Investment in Environmental Justice 
and provides a strong framework for continued involvement in environmental justice advances that support occupational health and safety protections of workers and communities. In addition, more information is detailed in the NIEHS Report on Advancing Environmental Justice- Contributions of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Division of Extramural Research and Training to Environmental Justice: 1998–2012.
 Recently in May 2023  the NIEHS WTP and the National Clearinghouse for Worker Safety and Health Training 
released a report entitled Building Capacity with Native Americans and Alaska Natives to Handle Hazardous Materials and Respond to Emergencies that summarizes training accomplishments for recipient's work with Native American tribes and Alaska Natives from 2015 to 2017. It describes how training efforts have protected tribal workers, increased employment opportunities, and built capacity to respond to disasters. It is important that training be targeted to these target populations and may include the existing tribal workforce; those likely to perform environmental clean-up and waste management work; those involved in waste transportation on, to, and from hazardous sites; appropriate supervisors and managers of contractor and subcontractor activities; emergency response personnel with site mutual aid agreements; appropriate Federal, state, tribal, and local government officials who are involved in compliance efforts; and community members, members of tribal nations, and emergency response personnel surrounding hazardous sites who would be responsible for or involved in a hazardous materials release.
Additionally, the NIEHS WTP activities support the HHS Environmental Justice Efforts, which provides clear direction of goals, strategies and actions to address environmental justice in disadvantaged communities and Native American tribes. The new strategic plan on environmental justice will be published in 2024.  
The NIEHS efforts to address occupational health disparities were explored in a workshop entitled Eliminating Health and Safety Disparities at Work in collaboration with NIOSH, EPA, and OSHA. This workshop brought together representatives from multiple disciplines and perspectives to understand the social, cultural, and economic factors that create and perpetuate occupational health and safety disparities and the papers disparities and the papers, reports, and publications. Special Issue: Achieving Health Equity in the Workplace, May 2014, Volume 57, Issue 5, Pages 493-614 examined the major research accomplishments and gaps in this area and identified promising practices for eliminating disparities through innovative intervention programs that are integral to supporting effective health and safety training under the NIEHS WTP.
Ongoing Program Initiatives
Since the previous NOFO (RFA-ES-19-003 
), NIEHS has published several reports that provide lessons learned, summaries of accomplishments, and evaluation and impact findings regarding our programs. These include an annual report of the Training Programs, highlights in state profiles, and a report of Native American and Alaska Native training through WTP.  Additionally, the Training Evaluation webpage 
includes resources such as recording of evaluation community of practice webinars.
To respond to the increase in technology-based training methods, NIEHS included an update in the Minimum Criteria under Section10.5, Instructional Technologies. The Minimum Criteria provide factors to consider when new training technologies are being considered for a training program and provides criteria to help ensure the technology-based activities address literacy and user-friendliness. With the emergence of new health and safety concerns for workers in the areas of green remediation, green jobs, green chemistry, nanotechnology, new industrial processes and chemicals, and combustible dust, it is clear that additional health and safety training approaches are necessary to address these new hazards to the hazardous waste workforce. There are other new issues that clearly impact the health and safety of current and new target populations including hazards associated with hydraulic fracking, responding to chemical emergencies, (Executive Order 13650 Improving Chemical Facility Safety and Security), responding to climate change events and sea level rise, as well as occupational health disparities and environmental justice, and identifying and meeting the needs of new training audiences such as citizen recovery workers during disasters, or returning veterans.
For Executive Order 13650, training should include improving operational coordination with State, Local, and Tribal Partners such as to improve health and safety training of workers at facilities and training associated with this safety. For the worker training community training to enhance and expand the application of process safety management is integral and reference to the OSHA Process Safety Management page is important. In addition, training that meets Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and Clean Air Act (CAA) to address emergency response, emergency preparedness training, and risk management plans is also encouraged.
As for climate change events and sea level rise, environmental cleanup workers, which may include community members, and emergency responders who must be trained to address hazards associated with the increase in frequency and intensity of climate events as described in Executive Order 13653: Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change. During disasters, WTP puts a human face on the term 'resilience.' WTP has long noted the stress, the physical danger, the exhaustion that our citizens face during and in the aftermath of these large-scale events. There is a role that training can play in preparing responders and recovery workers. A goal of the program is to develop health and safety training materials and resources for workers to support state, local, and tribal preparedness for resilience to climate change. For ECWTP training for careers in emergency response and infrastructure rebuilding of communities is encouraged. Plans for this training should include information on the target populations and for these populations, the need for training to address hazards and vulnerabilities associated with pre-incident, response, and recovery efforts after significant climate change events.
The NIEHS WTP will continue to address current and emerging preparedness, response and recovery efforts in disasters by deploying debris management and mold remediation training and providing personal protective equipment and informational materials to affected residents and communities. The NIEHS WTP Infectious Disease Response Training Program for workers across sectors who may be exposed to infectious diseases. This addresses an important gap revealed by the 2014 Ebola outbreak. The Ebola Biosafety and Infectious Disease Response WTP (RFA-ES-15-018) began June 1, 2016, and ran through May 31, 2019. NIEHS built federal capacity for biosecurity, biopreparedness, and rapid response to emerging infectious diseases, including developing an infrastructure of trainers and organizations who can be a resource during emergencies. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic WTP received a $10 million dollar appropriation that allowed recipients to provide at least 2,893 courses to 56,461 workers and to support community COVID recovery centers.
Under this announcement, training for biosafety preparedness is considered an ongoing program initiative and can be included in your training programs. As of May 31, 2018, the program has accomplished the following: Approximately 1,000 courses to 23,000 workers, with more than 90,000 contact hours, and in-person trainings in 37 states across the country. Approximately 65 train-the-trainer and trainer development courses were provided to more than 900 workers across the country to become trainers or increase their capacity to train. More than 40 new curricula are available in the NIEHS WTP Clearinghouse Curricula Catalog.
To address unmet mental health and resilience needs to be identified following disasters and the crisis surrounding misuse of prescription drugs in occupational settings, the WTP has developed curricula and held workshops to develop training options for organizations to address these concerns with workers and communities. Training tools are available on disaster worker and resiliency and prevention of occupational exposures. For a list of these curricula, applicants should refer to the WTP Responder and Community Resilience page.
Substance Use and Worker Health -The current drug overdose epidemic in the U.S. is having a significant impact on the health and well-being of individuals, communities, and workers. It has become increasingly evident that on-the-job exposure and substance use disorders are challenges that impact workers in different occupations.   Given the potential for exposure to these drugs and the hazardous substances used to produce them, it is important that workers in these industries understand how to protect themselves. Workplaces should strive to prevent substance use disorders by creating a healthy and safe workplace, providing support for workers in recovery to reenter or enter the workplace. It is encouraged that the occupational safety and health community work within coalitions to help build recovery supportive workplace programs and ensure they address work-related root causes of substance use through education and training. NIEHS training and approaches can be found on the Opioids and Substance Use: Workplace Prevention and Response web page, and detailed in the workshop report from October 2018 entitled Opioid-Related Hazards in the Workplace: Developing a Training Framework to address Exposure, Use, and Prevention. NIEHS review and identified gaps of recovery ready workplaces can be found in the report Recovery Friendly Workplace Landscape Analysis.
ECWTP Specific Goals and Objectives (formerly the MWTP)
 ECWTP focuses on delivering comprehensive job training  promote broad participation in the environmental remediation and construction industries, including individuals from disadvantaged communities. ECWTP will maintain its focus on building strong training collaborative programs between worker training organizations, such as labor-based organizations and community-based organizations, which have unique access to potential trainees from disadvantaged communities. Special attention will be directed at programs that successfully integrate job skills training with worker health and safety training to reach multiple locations for training. It is important that training locations do not overlap with existing training populations or locations to ensure a spread of training sites. Utilization of existing curricula is the preferred method for development of specific training under this program.
Major program goals are:
 Recruit target populations that are members of disadvantaged groups who live in areas near hazardous waste sites or in communities at risk of exposure to contaminated properties. We encourage that priority for recruitment target adult persons that are disadvantaged to increase the number of workers in the hazardous waste, construction and environmental remediation fields who are from disadvantaged groups based on exposure to environmental contamination and/or limited access to training.. These individuals must be unemployed or underemployed and reside in disadvantaged communities. Please note that consistent with NIH practice and applicable law, funded programs may not use the race, ethnicity, or sex of prospective program participants or faculty as an eligibility or selection criteria. The race, ethnicity, or sex of candidates will not be considered by NIH in the application review process or when making funding decisions. Training should be tailored to meet the needs of the target population for the entire time of the grant, and it is intended that training occur in multiple communities. 
 Training should address skills and knowledge required for different and diverse career opportunities in environmental restoration and construction with integration of new emerging environmental technology fields such as green jobs training, utilities, wastewater treatment, community health worker and other approaches depending on labor market needs in each community. Each program should develop specialized training programs specific to the workforce needs in their geographic area; however, hazardous materials and waste training remain the primary core curriculum. 
 Partnerships are essential to provide this diverse training, and it is important to include formal community based local partners to conduct specific training such as literacy training, job readiness, problem-solving skills, self-esteem, and teamwork. Life Skills training is a supportive service tailored to the individual's needs. The services might include remedial mathematics tutoring, budget counseling and cash management, life situational counseling and job readiness skills. These services prepare the student to take apprenticeship and employment examinations, as well as pass the environmental examinations leading to certifications in lead abatement, asbestos abatement, and hazardous waste operations. In addition, to obtain access to quality jobs in these fields' formal arrangement with environmental cleanup contractors and hazardous waste employers may be necessary. These environmental career-oriented projects are developed within the context of other social and health needs of the community. The different programs provide pre-employment job training, including literacy, job readiness, life skills, environmental preparation, and other related courses construction skills training; environmental worker training including hazardous waste, asbestos and lead abatement training; and safety and health training. Some training also includes enrollment in apprenticeship programs for construction and environmental remediation worker training.  Focus is placed on establishing a program of mentoring. Mentoring and counseling are also an important part of the ECWTP, as they help trainees to develop direction, confidence, and positive attitudes toward job training and work.
Student retention in training is imperative and strategies to engage participants throughout the various phases of the program are a major objective of the training. Also, a tracking program that describes the longevity of post-training employment of graduating training program participants, type of jobs, and specific types of sites where participants work is extremely critical to report job placements.
 Hazmat Disaster Preparedness Training Program (HDPTP) Goals and Objectives
 A goal of NIEHS program support under HDPTP is to enhance the safety and health training of hazardous materials workers, chemical responders, and skilled support personnel, and to create training materials and deliver methods for responders (cleanup workers and their communities) and to augment the prevention and preparedness efforts in a wide variety of high-risk settings. Creation of materials and delivery of proposed training to potential disaster response workers must be closely coordinated with the activities of authority having jurisdiction of the overall response effort and other involved local, state, and federal entities. WTP training has played a critical role in response to a variety of natural and manmade disasters, as well as public health emergencies.  For the 2023 funding period the program provided 911 courses and trained 29,993 workers.
One of the key lessons of the World Trade Center cleanup is the importance that skilled construction support personnel and hazardous materials response workers will play in any future disaster of national significance. Only the HWWTP applicants may apply for the HDPTP; therefore, NIEHS funds may be reprogrammed to allow disaster response participation with the approval of the NIEHS program administrator. Additionally, existing remediation and cleanup worker training courses must be refreshed using lessons learned and after-action reports from disaster responses and exercises to continually improve the health and safety of responders operating in disaster site conditions.
Enhanced training for current hazardous material workers and chemical responders who protect the nation's infrastructure from other potential terrorist attacks on chemical-intensive operations is a continuing high priority national need. This may support Executive Order 13650, that would include worker training community training to enhance and expand the application of process safety management. In addition, training that meets RCRA/CAA to address emergency response, emergency preparedness training, and risk management plans would also be encouraged as well as training that would improve operational coordination with state, local, and tribal partners. Additional focus is ensuring the program facilitates the translation of existing technical information on respiratory protection into tailored and culturally appropriate guidance and training materials designed for workers, particularly those who may be using respirators outside a respiratory protection program per the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report on Respiratory Protection for the Public and Workers Without Respiratory Protection Programs at their Workplaces.
Training under this program could also support Executive Order 13653, Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change. During disasters, WTP puts a human face on the term resilience. WTP has long noted the stress, the physical danger, the exhaustion that workers face during and following disasters. There is a role that training can play in preparing responders, including volunteers, day laborers as well as neighbors restoring neighborhoods and homes. The Minimum Criteria section 11.5 - Disaster Response and Recovery Workers references the role of volunteers and day laborers. In addition, numerous disasters have made clear that the term responder often applies to citizens protecting themselves, their property, and communities during and recovering from these events. There is likely a need for short, incident specific awareness training that can be delivered during the disaster recovery period including training on issues such as confined spaces, bloodborne pathogens, personal protective equipment, hazard assessment, fire watch, first aid/CPR, site safety, working around heavy equipment, physical threats such as heat stress, fatigue, shift work, fall protection, and psychological stress. In an effort to address unmet mental health and resilience needs identified following multiple disasters, the NIEHS WTP with support from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), launched the Gulf Responder Resilience Training Project (GRRTP) in 2012 to develop behavioral health training for disaster impacted communities. 
For a list of resources applicable to a variety of natural and man-made disasters, please visit our All-Hazards Resources
 page. Specific guidance on Disaster Response training and the all-hazards approach to training can be found in the Minimum Criteria Section 11.5 - Disaster Response and Recovery Workers.
Training initiatives should support the development of a nation-wide cadre of well-trained environmental response workers and emergency responders to ensure that the nation is prepared to respond to future disasters of national significance. This training should be patterned after the successful Hazardous Waste Worker Training Program that provides worker certification to workers who work safely on existing or new hazardous waste sites. A proposed disaster response training program should focus on health and safety and environmental issues and should include at a minimum review of NIMS, emergency response protocols, hazard communication, personal protection equipment and respiratory protection, and first aid training.
NIEHS encourages the updating and revising of existing curricula as a first priority. New training modules should only be developed if there is significant justification to address different biological, radiological, and chemical agents that can be incorporated into Hazardous Waste Refresher courses or can stand alone as part of a larger all hazards preparedness disaster training program as an important step toward creating a cadre of disaster prepared remediation and response workers. NIEHS resources can be used to support the development of trained and pre-certified skilled construction support personnel in relevant crafts for immediate response to national disasters or possible catastrophic attacks. In support of NIEHS WTP Emergency Support Activation Plan (ESAP), trainers may need to be NIMS compliant and should take appropriate identified courses to meet the requirements of the standards established at a disaster site.
Specifically for workers in high-hazard facilities like the oil, nuclear and petrochemical industry, which have been cited as likely targets for man-made or natural disasters, NIEHS will support development of awareness and operations level training programs that will prepare in-plant workers to react quickly to interface with the emergency response system, to prevent the release of hazardous materials during normal operations and to limit damage at the plant and to protect themselves, their fellow workers and the general public. For example, specific training to address Process Safety Management and Oil Spill and Refinery Fire Response such as the State's General Industrial Safety Order 5189.1 issued in July 2016 (PSM Regulation) addresses this need.
Preparation and delivery of training for workers with the capability of remediating buildings contaminated with biohazards such as anthrax, smallpox, and bio-toxic agents continue to be national priorities. The training must prepare these workers for environments that will be extremely hazardous and teach them appropriate work practices, use of personal protection equipment, and effective decontamination procedures.  Many remediation workers and other workers in high-risk facilities do not speak English as their native language and some do not speak English at all. Health and safety training materials and curricula must be understandable for workers at risk and need to be provided appropriately that will allow the demonstration of comprehension and proficiency of the training objectives. Trainers may need to be trained and courses may need to be conducted in a language other than English, with consideration given to cultural needs.  Specifically with Ebola and COVID-19 the WTP has invested considerable resources to address the needs of workers to protect themselves and their communities against infectious diseases.
Applicants are encouraged to consult with WTP staff for specific questions about their proposed project.

Information regarding the disposition of applications is available in the NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 2.4.4 Disposition of Applications.
1. Award Notices
If the application is under consideration for funding, NIH will request ""just-in-time"" information from the applicant as described in the NIH Grants Policy Statement. This request is not a Notice of Award nor should it be construed to be an indicator of possible funding.
A formal notification in the form of a Notice of Award (NoA) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. The NoA signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the recipient's business official.
Recipients must comply with any funding restrictions described in Section IV.6. Funding Restrictions. Selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. Any costs incurred before receipt of the NoA are at the recipient's risk. These costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs.
Any application awarded in response to this NOFO will be subject to terms and conditions found on the Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants website. This includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website.
Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Grantee institutions must ensure that protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.
All NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the NIH Grants Policy Statement as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General and Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Recipients, and Activities, including of note, but not limited to:
If a recipient is successful and receives a Notice of Award, in accepting the award, the recipient agrees that any activities under the award are subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other Department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions.
If a recipient receives and award, the recipient must follow all applicable nondiscrimination laws. The recipient agrees to this when registering in SAM.gov. The recipient must also submit an Assurance of Compliance (HHS-690). To learn more, see the Laws and Regulations Enforced by the HHS Office for Civil Rights website.
HHS recognizes that NIH research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this NOFO.
In accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to System for Award Management (SAM.gov) requirements. SAM.gov requires Federal agencies to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently SAM.gov) prior to making an award. An applicant can review and comment on any information in the responsibility/qualification records available in SAM.gov. NIH will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to the information available in the responsibility/qualification records in SAM.gov, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR Part 200.206 “Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.
The following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable US Office of Management and Budget (OMB)administrative guidelines, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) grant administration regulations at 2 CFR 200 , and other HHS, PHS, and NIH grant administration policies.
The administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an ""assistance"" mechanism (rather than an ""acquisition"" mechanism), in which substantial NIH programmatic involvement with the grant recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. Under the cooperative agreement, the NIH purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. Consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the grant recipients for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the grant recipients and the NIH as defined below.
The PD(s)/PI(s) will have the primary responsibility to:
<ul><li>Define objectives and approaches, and to plan, conduct, analyze, and publish results, interpretations, and conclusions of their studies and training activities.</li><li>Develop the details of the training plan, which must include a description of the technical approaches, target population access and recruitment, curricula modification, training methodology, and program evaluation procedures.</li><li>Attend recipient meetings at least twice annually to review progress, share information, and to coordinate training activities. PD/PIs and business officials shall attend at least one recipient meeting annually.</li><li>Before use submit draft copies of training manuals, instructor guides, course curricula and other materials developed for use in training activities supported by NIEHS to the NIEHS Program Coordinator to receive technical comments and suggestions regarding the adequacy, technical accuracy, and suitability of materials to be used for worker safety and health training.</li><li>Transmit final copies of all materials developed with support from NIEHS in approved electronic format to the National Clearinghouse for Worker Safety and Health Training for Hazardous Materials, Waste Operations and Emergency Response and make them available to the general public, subject to any specific legal caveats on use or copyright protection.</li><li>Participate annually in two technical workshops, which coincide with the two annual recipient meetings.</li><li>Convene a Board of Advisors representing user populations, labor, industry, governmental agencies, academic institutions or professional associations with interest and expertise in worker health and safety training related to hazardous materials and waste operations and emergency response. The Board of Advisors must meet annually to evaluate training activities and provide advice to the PD/PI.</li><li>Appoint one individual to manage information technology transfer and dissemination; access the WTP Data Management System and upload initial and final data - including the types of courses, number of students to be trained, and durations of training; and serve as the point of contact for the NIEHS Program Coordinator to ensure effective communication.</li></ul>NIH staff have substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:
Program Coordinator will:
<ul><li>Provide advice and make recommendations to PO, such as changing national priorities and directions or identifying areas of new opportunities and funding for program.</li><li>Liaison with recipient community to support our programs, projects and activities and will share their subject matter expertise such as occupational health and safety, industrial hygiene, emergency/disaster response, hazardous waste, nuclear remediation, infectious disease, and evaluation.</li><li>Engage with the PI/PD and other recipient staff to share knowledge and insights into the fields of science that could impact their training goals, objectives, and curricula and help to support any emergency response deployments.</li><li>Facilitate formal program evaluation and lead the evaluation community of practice with the NIEHS WTP.</li><li>Organize or call additional meetings/workshops of the participants to address emerging areas of high priority to the WTP and/or the problems of high incidence of illness and injury and mortality in populations experiencing occupational health disparities.</li><li>Organize and manage the WTP Data Management System and share updates with recipients on what is needed from recipients.</li></ul>Program Officials will: 
<ul><li>Be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award</li><li>Carry out continuous review of all activities to ensure objectives are being met</li></ul>Areas of Joint Responsibility include:
<ul><li>None; all responsibilities are divided between grant recipients and NIH staff as described above.</li></ul>Dispute Resolution
Any disagreement that may arise on scientific/programmatic matters (within the scope of the grant), between grant recipients and the NIH may be brought to dispute resolution. A dispute resolution panel will be composed of three members --one selected by the recipient, a second member selected by NIH, and the third member elected by the two prior selected members. These special dispute resolution procedures in no way affect the recipient's right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appeal able in accordance with PHS regulations at 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart D, and DHHS regulations at 45 CFR Part 16.
3. Data Management and Sharing
Consistent with the 2023 NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the Data Management and Sharing requirements as outlined in the NIH Grants Policy Statement. Upon the approval of a Data Management and Sharing Plan, it is required for recipients to implement the plan as described. 
When multiple years are involved, recipients will be required to submit the Research Performance Progress Report (RPPR) annually and financial statements as required in the NIH Grants Policy Statement.
A final RPPR, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the Federal Financial Report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the NIH Grants Policy Statement. NIH NOFOs outline intended research goals and objectives. Post award, NIH will review and measure performance based on the details and outcomes that are shared within the RPPR, as described at 2 CFR Part 200.301.
The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 as amended (FFATA), includes a requirement for recipients of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later. All recipients of applicable NIH grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) available at www.fsrs.gov on all subawards over the threshold. See the NIH Grants Policy Statement for additional information on this reporting requirement.
In accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 2 CFR Part 200.113 and Appendix XII to  2 CFR Part 200, recipients that have currently active Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a Federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the System for Award Management (SAM) about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a Federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. The recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings. Proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (Responsibility/Qualification in SAM.gov, formerly FAPIIS). This is a statutory requirement under section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313). As required by section 3010 of Public Law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for Federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available. Full reporting requirements and procedures are found in Appendix XII to 2 CFR Part 200 – Award Term and Condition for Recipient Integrity and Performance Matters.

Background
This funding announcement is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain management. More information about the HEAL Initiative is available at: https://heal.nih.gov/.
More than 25 million Americans suffer from daily chronic pain, a highly debilitating medical condition that is complex and difficult to manage. In recent decades, there has been an overreliance on the prescription of opioids for chronic pain despite their poor ability to improve function and high addiction liability. This contributed to a significant and alarming epidemic of opioid addictions and overdose deaths. Innovative scientific solutions to develop alternative pain treatment options are thus critically needed.
Through targeted research efforts, the NIH HEAL Initiative aims to accelerate the discovery and preclinical development of new medications to treat pain. The goal of this NOFO is to encourage initial translational efforts that will support and enable a drug discovery program by providing funds for the development and validation of assays and identification and characterization of potential therapeutic agents. It is expected that upon project completion, investigators will have well-validated assay(s) and/or potential therapeutic agent(s)  that meet the entry criteria for the HEAL Initiative’s Pain Therapeutics Development Program (PTDP) or other later-stage translational programs.
This NOFO is not specific for any one or group of pain conditions. Projects focused on acute pain, chronic pain, painful neuropathy, musculoskeletal pain, headache disorders, osteoarthritis, diabetic neuropathy, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, eye pain, sickle-cell pain, post-surgical pain, cancer pain, visceral pain, obstetric pain, gynecologic pain, post stroke pain, myofascial pain, painful disorders of the orofacial region, pain co-occurring with substance use disorders, pain across the lifespan and in the context of aging, and other conditions will be considered. Projects that seek to identify novel therapeutics for underrepresented patient populations are also responsive for this NOFO. Input from people with lived experience on the therapeutic goals of the project is highly encouraged.
The NIH HEAL Initiative will require a high level of coordination and sharing between investigators. It is expected that NIH HEAL Initiative recipients  will cooperate and coordinate their activities after awards are made by participating in Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) meetings, including an annual HEAL Scientific Meeting, as well as other activities.
Scope
This NOFO is intended to support early-stage translational activities including development and validation of assays, screening efforts to identify initial hits or bioactives, and in vitro characterization of potential analgesic agents. Therapeutic agents supported within this NOFO include small molecules, biologics (modalities such as peptides, proteins, oligonucleotides, gene therapies, cell therapies, and novel emerging modalities), and natural products. For the purposes of this NOFO, natural products are defined as extracts, chromatographic fractions, or isolated secondary metabolites derived from herbal, botanical, marine, microbial, or animal sources. Projects funded through this NOFO can include targeted or phenotypic assays (either cell-based or utilizing non-mammalian model organisms (e.g., D. rerio, C. elegans)). Except for limited studies of target deconvolution following phenotypic screening, projects designed for target identification are not covered under this NOFO.
Preclinical in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and efficacy studies may also be supported by this NOFO, however applicants will need to provide sufficient evidence demonstrating the proposed agent(s) or tool compound(s) have been sufficiently characterized to support interpretable in vivo studies (see Section IV.2 Research Strategy for details). For the purposes of this NOFO, in vivo efficacy measures reflect the effects of the therapeutic agent on endpoints that are closely tied to the desired clinical endpoints, but do not necessarily reflect target engagement. While PD measures may also reflect the effects of the therapeutic agent on endpoints closely tied to the desired clinical endpoint, they must also reflect in vivo target engagement. Note: Potential agents proposed for in vivo testing must be clearly described in the application.
 This NOFO is not intended to support projects that include both screening activities and follow-on in vivo testing of newly identified hits. 
This program is intended to support projects with a strong biological rationale for a druggable target, which can be a specific molecule(s), cell type(s), or molecular/cellular pathway(s) or circuits. Rationale for the chosen target should be supported by rigorous experimental evidence from in vitro, in vivo, and potentially clinical studies, confirming its role in the pathophysiology of a particular pain condition and supporting the hypothesis that modulating target activity will produce desirable therapeutic effects. Limited biology studies may be included as a part of applications to this NOFO, but only to fill specific gaps in an otherwise robust data package supporting a validated target. Applicants who are lacking this rationale are encouraged to consider other NIH HEAL Initiative opportunities (https://heal.nih.gov/funding/open) that support discovery and validation of targets that can be used to develop treatments that have minimal side effects and little to no abuse/addiction liability, such as, RFA-NS-22-034 “HEAL Initiative: Discovery and Validation of Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Pain Treatment (R01 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)”.
The goal of this NOFO is to advance projects to the point where they meet the entry criteria for the Pain Therapeutics Development Program (PTDP) or other later stage translational programs. PTDP projects are currently supported through RFA-NS-24-019,
 “HEAL Initiative: Non-addictive Analgesic Therapeutics Development [Small Molecules and Biologics] to Treat Pain (UG3/UH3 Clinical Trial Optional)”. Entry criteria include the following: applicants must have a promising biologic or small molecule starting point for optimization, robust biological rationale for the intended approach, and scientifically sound assays for optimization of the agent. The scope of PTDP includes preclinical optimization and early development activities, Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies, development of a pharmacodynamic/target engagement biomarker, assembly and filing of an IND application and Phase I clinical testing. While RFA-NS-25-012
 (this NOFO) may also support preliminary in vivo studies for sufficiently characterized therapeutic agents, applicants with such agents are strongly encouraged to review the PTDP criteria and to consult with NIH Program staff when determining which funding opportunity is most appropriate.
Entry Criteria
<ul><li>Novelty: This NOFO seeks to apply new knowledge around targets, mechanisms, pathways, or therapeutic modalities. Projects should aim to develop non-addictive analgesics/therapeutics that are significant improvements over existing pain management strategies.</li><li>Biological rationale and preliminary data: Projects must have strong biological rationale for the intended approach. Preliminary data should reflect rigorous, well-designed experiments (either from the literature, data from other sources, or, when available, from investigator-generated data). Examples of the most critical elements for a well-designed study are summarized on the NINDS website: https://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/preparing-your-application/preparing-research-plan/rigorous-study-design-and-transparent-reporting.</li><li>Relevance for therapy development: Projects should ultimately aim to discover novel therapeutic agents that can be advanced towards development of effective pain management strategies. Applications should be supported by a cogent rationale for how the proposed approach will result in new and promising non-addictive treatment(s) for pain.</li></ul>Research Objectives
This initiative is primarily focused on assay development and validation, screening for identification of initial hits, and in vitro characterization of potential therapeutic agents. Example activities can include, but are not limited to:
<ul><li>Development and validation of assay(s) to support a distinct testing funnel, including but not limited to:<ul><li>Assays to evaluate potency, specificity, selectivity, purity, identity, or stability of therapeutic agent(s).</li><li>Binding assays (e.g., radioligand, yeast-two hybrid, surface plasmon resonance, fluorescent polarization, biopanning, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)).</li><li>Assays for biophysical characterization of secondary or tertiary structure, conformational stability, aggregation, or oligomerization</li><li>Assays to evaluate cellular uptake, target engagement, transduction/infection, and downstream functional read-outs.</li><li>Optimization of assays for medium- or high-throughput screening (HTS).</li></ul></li></ul>A combination of assays may also be developed to demonstrate relevant biological activity when a single assay may not provide adequate measurement of overall potency due to a complex mechanism of action or multiple activities of a preliminary therapeutic agent.
<ul><li>Screening to identify initial hits, including application of biophysical and computational methods (e.g., virtual screening based on target structure, siRNA scanning).</li><li>Synthesis and in vitro characterization of a focused set of therapeutic agents. This could include for example, in vitro potency, selectivity, degradation products, or in vitro absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME).</li><li>Assessment of therapeutic agent properties using computational analysis and early physicochemical measurements, polar surface area, solubility, cell permeability and efflux.</li><li>Preparation of therapeutic agent(s) and confirmation of structure, sequence, purity, stability, or biological characteristics.</li><li>Development and selection of cell lines/vectors to produce bioactive agents (non-GMP/GLP).</li><li>Development of bioanalytical assays or detection methods to accurately quantify therapeutic agents (and potential metabolites).</li><li>Limited in vitro or ex vivo biology studies for validation of an agent’s mechanism of action or to fill specific scientific gaps that directly inform critical path activities in a drug discovery program.</li></ul>Applicants should consider the role the assay(s) will play in the therapeutic discovery and decision-making process for the intended target and its relevance for treatments of specific human pain conditions/disorders. The proposed assays should also have sufficient throughput for iterative screening of potential therapeutic agents. Applications proposing screening activities should clearly identify the source and the size of the library to be screened. There is no minimum required size, but the library should be suitable for screening and sufficient to identify promising analgesic hits. Projects conducting computational work must include follow up in vitro characterization to at least confirm hit activity and potentially other key characteristics. Projects may also include preparation of a focused set of therapeutic agents based on the hits identified, and in vitro characterization thereof. Follow-on studies for phenotypic screening and/or screening of natural product libraries may include medicinal chemistry efforts, but these must be limited to efforts designed explicitly to elucidate mechanism of action of the compound (e.g., target pull down, click chemistry, etc.). For use and development of iPSC lines, please see NOT-NS-24-019
.
 
For projects with potential therapeutic agents or tool compounds: Applications including in vivo studies must have a potential therapeutic agent or tool compound in hand with sufficient evidence to support its use for the proposed studies (see Section IV.2 Research Strategy for details). Example activities can include, but are not limited to:
<ul><li>Pharmacokinetic studies to determine direct or indirect therapeutic agent levels. For some biologic modalities, traditional PK might not apply; such applicants should still aim to measure the kinetics and distribution as needed for therapeutic development. For gene and cell therapy, these can include characterization of gene copy numbers or tropism in tissues or cell engraftment.</li><li>Studies to confirm that therapeutic agent(s) reach and engage the target site (directly or indirectly) at a concentration that exceeds in vitro pharmacological potency over the desired period.</li><li>Studies to confirm selectivity of the therapeutic agent(s) or mechanism of action.</li><li>Pharmacodynamic and/or in vivo efficacy studies in suitable animal models including positive and negative controls, as appropriate.</li><li>Assessment of potential off target activities, addictive potential, or other liabilities (e.g., preliminary safety).</li><li>Limited biology studies for validation of an agent’s mechanism of action.</li><li>Validation and replication studies to confirm observed results.</li></ul>Applicants proposing in vivo efficacy studies will be expected to provide strong rationale for the chosen model(s), outcome measures, and endpoints, and should consider the extent to which these have been rigorously validated. As pain is a multidimensional experience, applicants are highly encouraged to consider the sensory/discriminative, affective/motivational, and cognitive aspects of pain in the context of the chosen model(s). Preferred measures of pain in animals are those that are non-invasive, non-evoked, objective, and that permit a behavioral or functional assessment of pain and pain treatment outcomes.
Phased Award Mechanism and Transition to the R33 Phase
This NOFO uses the R61/R33 Phased Innovation Award mechanism in which the R61 phase is generally utilized to support preparatory or prerequisite activities that establish feasibility for execution of the R33 phase. The R61 and R33 phases cannot overlap in time. Applicants should propose R61 and R33 phase activities based on the stage of the project relative to identification of potential therapeutic agents and what is needed to inform downstream activities and/or further de-risk the project. Examples can include, but are not limited to:
<ul><li>Initial development, refinement, and validation of in vitro/ex vivo assays in the R61 phase with screening and hit confirmation/characterization in the R33 phase.</li><li>Assay optimization for increased throughput and a pilot screen in the R61 phase with a full-scale HTS in the R33 phase.</li><li>Small scale screening, synthesis, and/or bio- and physicochemical characterization of potential therapeutic agents in the R61 phase followed by cell-based functional and electrophysiology-based assays in the R33 phase.</li><li>For applications with predefined and well-characterized therapeutic agents, PK should be conducted in the R61 phase to inform dosage and timing of any in vivo studies in the R33 phase.</li></ul>Transition from the R61 to the R33 phase is contingent upon the successful completion of proposed project milestones. For the purposes of this NOFO, milestones are quantitative goals used for measuring success that support go/no-go decision-making. Milestones should have timelines and quantitative criteria associated with them, and all milestones should be useful as a measure of progress toward the overall goal of the project. NINDS emphasizes the importance of the robustness and reproducibility of experimental results in evaluating progress. Specific Aims or a list of activities planned for each year are not considered milestones because they do not provide decision-making goals. Section IV includes additional information regarding project milestones. For frequently asked questions and milestone examples, please see https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Current-Research/Research-Funded-NINDS/Translational-Research/Funding-Programs-Researchers/IGNITE.
Prior to funding an application, NIH Program staff may contact the applicant to discuss the proposed milestones and any changes suggested by the review panel or Program staff. A final set of approved milestones will be specified in the Notice of Award.
Leveraging Existing Resources 
Additional information on guidance for assay development may be found in the online comprehensive Assay Guidance Manual (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53196/), HTS assay protocols deposited in the PubChem BioAssay Database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pcassay) as well as the published literature. Applicants are also encouraged to take advantage of the resources provided by the NIH Molecular Libraries and Imaging Program (https://commonfund.nih.gov/molecularlibraries/index). One notable publicly available natural products library is managed by the National Cancer Institute (https://dtp.cancer.gov/organization/npb/introduction.htm).

<ul><li>Activities for both the R61 and R33 phases with a clear demarcation of which activities are in the R61 phase and which are in the R33 phase, as described in Section IV.2.</li><li>Quantitative Go/no-go Project Milestones in the Research Strategy, as described in Section IV.2.</li><li>An Intellectual Property (IP) Strategy as an attachment, as described in Section IV.2.</li></ul>Additional Considerations
CollaborationsDeveloping therapeutics requires a multidisciplinary approach. Investigators should form collaborations with those familiar with successful drug/biologic development (such as those from industry) as well as those familiar with what the desired end-product should look like (such as biostatisticians, technical experts, and clinicians). Applicants should consider how they will identify and foster relationships with potential licensing and commercialization partners early in the therapy development process once an award is made. PDs/PIs are expected to work closely with their institutional technology transfer officials to ensure that royalty agreements, patent filings, and all other necessary IP arrangements are completed in a timely manner and that commercialization plans are developed and updated over the course of the project.
In addition to scientific diversity, applicants should strive to incorporate diversity in their teams. Research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. There are many benefits that flow from a diverse NIH-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust. In spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. NIH encourages institutions to diversify their student and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences. Please refer to Notice of NIH's Interest in Diversity NOT-OD-20-031 for more details.
Engaging People with Lived Experience and Other Collaborators  People with lived experience (e.g., patients, patient advocates, caregivers, families, community leaders) have important insights that can improve meaningful outcomes, uptake of research findings, and health equity across the continuum of research from basic through implementation studies. The perspectives of other relevant collaborators (e.g., health service providers, payors, public health agencies, community-based organizations, biotech, pharma) can further improve research impact. The NIH HEAL initiative strongly encourages applicants to specify their plan for meaningful engagement of people with lived experience and other collaborators in the research process. Meaningful engagement will vary with the focus of the research but should at minimum ensure that researchers are connecting with relevant collaborators and incorporating their perspectives throughout the conception, implementation, and dissemination of the research. Meaningful engagement should address what the researchers will learn and how the people with lived experience and/or collaborators will benefit from the partnership. To promote health equity, as is relevant for the research proposed, it is recommended that at least two people with lived experience from populations who experience health disparities should be meaningfully engaged in these efforts (see this resource for more information in engaging people with lived experience: https://aspe.hhs.gov/lived-experience).
Rigor and TransparencyNIH strives for rigor and transparency in all research it funds. For this reason, the NIH HEAL Initiative explicitly emphasizes and provides supplemental guidance to NIH application instructions related to rigor and transparency (https://grants.nih.gov/policy/reproducibility/guidance.htm) and provides additional guidance to the scientific community (https://www.ninds.nih.gov/funding/preparing-your-application/preparing-research-plan/rigorous-study-design-and-transparent-reporting). For example, the biological rationale for the proposed experiments must be based on rigorous and robust supporting data, which means that data should be collected via methods that minimize the risk of bias and be reported in a transparent manner. If previously published or preliminary studies do not meet these standards, applicants should address how the current study design addresses the deficiencies in rigor and transparency. Proposed experiments should likewise be designed in a manner that minimizes the risk of bias and ensures validity of experimental results.

National Eye Institute (NEI)NEI is interested in applications that advance the understanding of, and potential therapy for, ocular pain. Ocular surface disease, and dry eye disease, present a currently unmet need despite clear clinical significance. Moreover, photorefractive surgery procedures can result in discomfort and pain in patients who undergo these procedures. While most such patients report an eventual resolution of ocular pain symptoms some patients report longer-term chronic pain. The underlying biology that may account for such individual differences in outcomes is not well understood. NEI encourages applications under this NOFO that may advance non-addictive analgesic therapeutics development in this critical area. Ultimately, the goal is to identify and validate novel or repositioned non-opioid analgesics for corneal pain.
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)The NIDDK encourages applications for research to develop therapies and technologies for pain conditions within the mission of NIDDK. Topics of special interest include, but are not limited to the pain associated with diabetic neuropathy; urologic chronic pelvic pain syndromes such as Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS) and Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome; urinary stone disease and post-ureteroscopy stent-associated pain; functional gastrointestinal and motility disorders such as gastroparesis and irritable bowel syndrome; inflammatory bowel disease; hepatobiliary diseases such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and biliary dyskinesia; and exocrine pancreatic diseases such chronic pancreatitis.

Specific Aims
: Within the Specific Aims section, include headers titled “R61 Phase Specific Aims” and “R33 Phase Specific Aims”. Under each header, state the specific objectives of the efforts, including the technical questions to be answered. Since the goal is therapy development, hypothesis testing, per se, may not be the driving force in developing such an application.
Research Strategy
: The Research Strategy must include the following sections:
A. SignificanceB. ApproachC. InnovationD. Therapeutic Discovery PlanE. Milestones and Timeline
Note: The HEAL Initiative strongly encourages applicants to form multidisciplinary teams that consist of academic/industry experts relevant to the research plan (i.e., biostatisticians, clinicians, drug development experts, technical experts). This multidisciplinary team should be able to define the goals of the research, outline specific gaps that need to be addressed during this funding period, and execute the research strategy. HEAL also strongly encourages applications from diverse teams of investigators, including PI/PDs and team members that are underrepresented in the biomedical workforce (defined in NOT-OD-20-031) as well as meaningful engagement of people with lived experience (see Section I of the funding opportunity for more information). Applicants should highlight elements of such collaborations within the research strategy.
A. Significance
:Applications must include a section that clearly outlines the biological and therapeutic rationale for the project, including: 1) a description of the biological rationale linking the proposed therapeutic target and the specific human pain condition(s) and/or disease of interest, 2) evidence for unmet medical need relevant to the targeted pain indication, 3) a brief description of the therapeutic landscape, including any pertinent history for therapeutic development in the disease area or for the proposed therapeutic target, 4) a description of why the target, therapeutic modality, and/or proposed plan are likely to have an impact on the unmet medical need, and 5) rationale supporting limited potential for addiction liability of the proposed therapeutic approach.
For applications proposing to conduct in vivo studies to assess initial PK, PD, preliminary efficacy, or safety:
 applicants MUST identify and clearly describe the therapeutic agent(s) to be tested and provide sufficient evidence such that reviewers can evaluate whether 1) the agent has been sufficiently characterized in vitro and 2) the physicochemical and/or biological properties of the agent are suitable and appropriate to justify in vivo efficacy testing. Evidence should include demonstration of the following, as appropriate for the therapeutic modality and intended target: confirmation of chemical identify, purity, stability, and biological activity (i.e., potency, selectivity, and specificity). Provide any additional evidence that demonstrates knowledge of the agent’s mechanism of action or intended impact on cell signaling pathways. Note: therapeutic agents should be characterized enough for meaningful initial preclinical proof of concept in an animal model. It is not required that compounds be at a lead stage. Hit-to-lead and lead-optimization work is supported in PDTP. Please see RFA-NS-24-019 for details.
Applicants should indicate whether data presented or cited in the application as key support for the proposed work were collected, analyzed, and reported in a rigorous and transparent manner as indicated above. A plan to address any ambiguity, weaknesses, or limitations in the prior research should be included in the application. Proposed experiments should similarly adhere to these high standards of rigor and transparency.
B. Approach
:
Describe the overall strategy, methodology and other considerations that will be used to accomplish the Specific Aims of the R61 and R33 phases. Applicants must describe both the R61 and the R33 phases. Clear demarcation of which activities are in each phase is required. The phases must not overlap in time.
Applicants must include detailed descriptions of their actual and proposed assays, including a definition of their intended purpose and data or plans to obtain data indicating the robustness, reliability, and throughput of the assay(s) (e.g., acceptable Z-factor or variability, and sufficient sensitivity, specificity, and dynamic range). Specify any reference standards, positive, and negative controls that will be used to assess assay behavior. Assays must be presented within the context of a screening and follow-up assay flow diagram or a distinct testing funnel for bioactive agent characterization. This can include, for example, a primary screening assay and downstream assays that are intended to verify specific activity of identified actives (e.g., counterscreens, orthogonal assays, selectivity assays, mode of action assays). Within the flow diagram or testing funnel, applicants must clearly indicate the process or criteria for selecting compounds/biologics at each stage or iteration.
Applications conducting a screen must include rationale for selection of the proposed library as well as provide sufficient characteristics of the library to justify its use against the proposed assay, such as composition, internal controls, storage conditions, and availability of compounds for follow-up testing. Applications must also outline the schema that will be used to follow up on hits to confirm activity, selectivity, and specificity as well as appropriate criteria for defining a useful active hit. Incorporating a pilot screen to verify suitability of the assay for future screening efforts is strongly encouraged, where appropriate (i.e., prior to initiating a large HTS).
Applications conducting in vitro characterization of a focused set of preliminary therapeutic agents must include a carefully designed plan for characterizing the agent(s) from a physicochemical, biophysical, and biological perspective, as appropriate for the therapeutic modality, intended target, and pain indication. Plans for establishment of a dose-response relationship to understand the concentration-dependent effects of the proposed therapeutic agent(s) are strongly encouraged.
For applications proposing to conduct in vivo studies to assess initial PK, PD, preliminary efficacy, or safety
: Describe how the PK studies and/or PD studies will be used to inform subsequent efficacy testing and provide rationale for the proposed route and timing of therapeutic dosing. Where appropriate, include data or plans to obtain data indicating the sensitivity and specificity of any proposed analytical methods for quantitative analysis of the therapeutic agent. Applicants must also provide strong rationale for the chosen model(s) as well as evidence to support the robustness of any proposed PD measure(s), behavioral outcome measure(s) or pathophysiological endpoints used therein. This includes rationale for what would be considered a clinically meaningful effect size along with justification of sample size and statistical methods. 
An R61/R33 Phased Innovation Award application in translational research should have a strong biological rationale for the intended approach, supporting data from rigorously designed experiments, and proposed studies that exhibit methodological rigor. Furthermore, sufficient information should be available about study design, execution, analysis, and interpretation in order to assess the predictive value of the research. NINDS urges investigators to follow the NIH guidance for rigor and transparency in grant applications (https://grants.nih.gov/policy/reproducibility/guidance.htm  and additionally recommends the research practices described https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Funding/grant_policy. This will ensure that robust experiments are designed, potential experimenter biases are minimized, results and analyses are transparently reported, and results are interpreted carefully. These recommended research practices include, where applicable, expressing clear rationale for the chosen model(s) and primary/secondary endpoint(s), describing tools and parameters clearly, blinding, randomizing, ensuring adequate sample size, pre-specifying inclusion/exclusion criteria, appropriately handling missing data and outliers, implementing appropriate controls, pre-planning analyses, and using appropriate quantitative techniques. It is also strongly recommended to indicate clearly the exploratory vs. confirmatory components of the study, consider study limitations, and plan for transparent reporting of all methods, analyses, and results so that other investigators can evaluate the quality of the work and potentially perform replications.
C. Innovation
: Applicants must include a section addressing how the project offers a novel approach to treating the proposed disease indication. Novelty of the therapeutic strategy over what is currently available in the clinic or under therapeutic development by the field should be emphasized. Comment on the novelty of proposed approach, target, pathway, assays, or models.
D. Therapeutic Discovery Plan
: At the completion of this project, it is expected that applicants will have made significant progress towards advancing projects to the point where they meet the entry criteria for the Pain Therapeutics Development Program (PTDP), or other later-stage NIH program or private investment.  Within this section, applicants must include a description of how knowledge gained from this work will support future therapeutic discovery efforts beyond the project period through to early clinical trials. As part of this consideration, attention should be paid to the intended patient population such that appropriate experiments (assays, targets, animal models, end point measures, routes of administration, etc.) are used in the current application. Applicants are strongly encouraged to review the PTDP entry criteria and associated funding opportunity RFA-NS-24-019 when preparing this section. More details can be found at https://www.ninds.nih.gov/current-research/trans-agency-activities/ninds-role-heal-initiative/pain-therapeutics-development-program-ptdp
E. Milestones and Timeline
: Provide a timeline with specific project milestones for progression from the R61 phase to the R33 phase. Within the timeline, indicate when it is anticipated that essential components of the project (e.g., validation of assays, identification of screening hits, generation and in vitro characterization of therapeutic agents, pharmacokinetics studies (if applicable)) will be completed.
Transition from the R61 to the R33 phase is contingent upon the successful completion of one set of proposed project milestones. The application MUST include milestones that are clearly specified, well-defined, measurable, and include quantitative criteria for success to allow objective assessment of progress and support go/no-go decision making. Project milestones must be scientifically justified and appropriate for the proposed objectives of the application, therapeutic approach, and indication. Discuss the suitability of the milestones for assessing progress in the R61 phase and the implications of successful completion of these milestones for the proposed R33 phase. Milestones will be used to evaluate the application in peer review as well as in consideration of the awarded project for funding of non-competing award years. 
Letters of Support: Applicants should include letters of support from consultants, contractors, and collaborators.
<ul><li>If applying from an academic institution, include a letter of support from the technology transfer official who will be managing intellectual property associated with this project.</li><li>If research will be performed at more than one institution, include a letter of support from each institution clarifying how intellectual property will be shared or otherwise managed across the institutions.</li><li>If collaborating with a private entity, include a letter of support that addresses any agreement to provide agent(s), any limits on the studies that can be performed with said agent(s), any limitations on sharing of data (including negative results), and whether a licensing agreement(s) is in place.

1. Criteria
Only the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process.  Applications submitted to the NIH in support of the NIH mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system.
For this particular NOFO, note the following:
The HEAL Initiative is encouraging applications for translational research that may involve standard methodologies applied toward novel therapeutic approaches. Therefore, a project that does not necessarily employ novel methodologies may still be essential to advance the field.
Overall Impact
Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). The overall impact score should also reflect reviewers’ assessment of the likelihood for the research to advance projects to the point where they can meet the entry criteria for RFA-NS-24-019 under the Pain Therapeutics Development Program (PTDP), or other later stage translational programs. 
Key entry criteria for PTDP include having the following: 
<ul><li>a promising biologic or small molecule starting point for optimization, </li><li>robust biological rationale for the intended approach, and </li><li>scientifically sound assays for optimization of the agent.</li></ul>
Scored Review Criteria
Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.
Significance
Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? Is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous?

Information regarding the disposition of applications is available in the NIH Grants Policy Statement Section 2.4.4 Disposition of Applications.
1. Award Notices
If the application is under consideration for funding, NIH will request ""just-in-time"" information from the applicant as described in the NIH Grants Policy Statement. This request is not a Notice of Award nor should it be construed to be an indicator of possible funding.
A formal notification in the form of a Notice of Award (NoA) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. The NoA signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the recipient's business official.
Recipients must comply with any funding restrictions described in Section IV.6. Funding Restrictions. Selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. Any costs incurred before receipt of the NoA are at the recipient's risk. These costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs.
Any application awarded in response to this NOFO will be subject to terms and conditions found on the Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants website.  This includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website.
Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.
2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements
All NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the NIH Grants Policy Statement as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General and Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Recipients, and Activities, including of note, but not limited to:
If a recipient is successful and receives a Notice of Award, in accepting the award, the recipient agrees that any activities under the award are subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other Department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions.
If a recipient receives an award, the recipient must follow all applicable nondiscrimination laws. The recipient agrees to this when registering in SAM.gov. The recipient must also submit an Assurance of Compliance (HHS-690). To learn more, see the Laws and Regulations Enforced by the HHS Office for Civil Rights website. 
HHS recognizes that NIH research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this NOFO.
In accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to System for Award Management (SAM.gov) requirements. SAM.gov requires Federal agencies to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently SAM.gov) prior to making an award. An applicant can review and comment on any information in the responsibility/qualification records available in SAM.gov. NIH will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to the information available in the responsibility/qualification records in SAM.gov, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR Part 200.206 “Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.
Not Applicable

Recently issued trans-NIH policy notices may affect your application submission. A full list of policy notices published by NIH is provided in the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts. All awards are subject to the terms and conditions, cost principles, and other considerations described in the NIH Grants Policy Statement.
Awards are made under the authorization of Sections 301 and 405 of the Public Health Service Act as amended (42 USC 241 and 284) and under Federal Regulations 42 CFR Part 52 and 2 CFR Part 200.",,National Institutes of Health,Scientific & High Quality,"Funding Opportunity RFA-NS-25-012 from the NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts. This funding opportunity is part of a suite of NOFOs within the NIH HEAL Initiative to support the development of safe, effective, and non-addictive therapeutics to treat pain. The goal is to encourage initial translational efforts that will support a drug discovery program and advance projects to the point where they meet the entry criteria for the Pain Therapeutics Development Program. The scope will therefore be focused on development of assays to support a distinct testing funnel, screening efforts to identify hits, and initial characterization of hits and potential therapeutic agents (including small molecules, biologics, and natural products).",community impact and support,0.36633333563804626
By Carmen Paun,‘No longer the 1960s’: Congress wants to treat drug users in mental hospitals,Lawmakers are on the verge of allowing Medicaid to cover substance use treatment in the facilities.,https://www.politico.com/news/2024/01/01/mental-hospitals-drug-users-congress-00132671,https://static.politico.com/2c/6a/5ccb8abd4b3592b0babf52ab67b9/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/1780559851,2024-01-01T12:00:00Z,"It is no longer the 1960s, and there is no longer the same stigma against the treatment of mental health, said GOP Rep. Michael Burgess, a doctor representing Dallas affluent northern suburbs who sponsored a House bill to change the rule.
The House passed it Dec. 12. It would give states the option to treat Medicaid patients suffering from addiction for up to a month in a mental hospital on the governments dime. The Senate Finance Committee approved a similar provision in November, so its prospects of enactment are good.
Burgess co-sponsor was Ritchie Torres, a Democrat from New York Citys poorest section, the South Bronx, 
who has spent time in the hospital for his own mental health struggles.
Public health groups including the Treatment Advocacy Center and the National Alliance on Mental Illness, as well as state Medicaid directors, support the change.
They say the 1965 rule barring Medicaid, the federal-state health care program for the poor and lower-middle income, from funding hospital treatment has had unintended consequences: a lack of psychiatric beds for people who need them. Instead, they said, many vulnerable people end up on the streets, in emergency rooms, in jails or dead.
They say the policy also 
perpetuates discrimination against people who suffer from drug addiction and mental illness compared to those with physical conditions, for which theres no such exclusion.
Republicans in Congress agree. Democrats are divided.
New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee that shepherded the bill, resisted the change, wary of a return to institutionalizing people with mental illness instead of caring for them in their homes, ideally, with a team of specialized health and social workers.
We know that one of the best ways to help people in recovery is to ensure they have access to care in their communities, he said.
Pallone ultimately relented because Republicans agreed to improve Medicaid coverage for some incarcerated people with substance use disorder.

But fears of reinstitutionalization have also animated civil rights advocates who support the restriction on Medicaid funds. They fear a slippery slope back to warehousing the sick and point to states like California and New York that are already experimenting with forcing patients into care.
Lifting the Medicaid rule would reduce pressure to do whats really needed, said Lewis Bossing, senior staff attorney at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law: increase services in communities.
People have better outcomes in terms of reduced hospitalization rates, reduced criminal legal system involvement, increased employment, increased measures of social integration when theyre served in the community, versus having to be at an institution to get care, he said.
The rise and fall of the mental hospital
States started building mental health hospitals in the 1800s, aiming to 
provide people with severe mental illness with care instead of throwing them in jail.
But 
the hospitals soon became overcrowded, understaffed and underfinanced. Abuse was rife, according to an 
investigation published in Life Magazine in 1946: Patients were restrained for days, thrown into solitary confinement, starved and sometimes beaten to death.
More than half a million people were in state mental health hospitals in 1963, half of them in facilities housing more than 3,000 people, President John F. Kennedy said 
in a speech that year.
Kennedy laid out a plan for states to build comprehensive community mental health centers, with federal support. They would combine diagnostic services, emergency psychiatric units, inpatient and outpatient services and rehabilitation.
The law establishing Medicaid two years later prohibited federal money from paying for care in mental health care facilities with more than 16 beds to avoid pouring money into what Kennedy called outdated institutional care. The rule now covers people between 21 and 64 years old.
Many state hospitals closed but the community mental health system, as Kennedy envisioned it, never came to fruition, advocates on both sides of the debate say.
Those who dont want the Medicaid funding ban repealed would like states and the federal government to focus on building that system, while those who want to see the policy gone say both community and hospital care are needed to provide people with what they need, depending on their circumstances.
A person diagnosed with mental illness and substance use disorder needs inpatient care for doctors to stabilize them, argued Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a gastroenterologist and top member of the two committees with power over the policy.
The people who were so opposed to this because they still want to do it in an outpatient [facility], you wonder if theyve ever actually lived with somebody who is seriously psychotic, Cassidy said.
Advocates argue that repealing the Medicaid policy is needed to provide people with the best treatment options.

Over the last decade, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has started allowing states to use federal dollars to pay for care in mental health hospitals for a limited time, as long as they obtain a waiver. Thirty-six 
states now have a waiver to treat people with substance use disorder and a dozen states have a waiver for treating other mental illnesses in psychiatric hospitals.
California found that its waiver to provide medication-assisted treatment for people with substance use disorder in mental hospitals helped individuals who need a relatively intensive level of care for short-term stabilization of acute needs, said Ann Carroll, the California Department of Health Care Services spokesperson.
Even so, the system as it stands is failing to provide state-of-the-art care to many patients. One-third of the 1.5 million Medicaid enrollees with opioid use disorder, for example, 
did not receive medication treatment in 2021, according to the HHS inspector general.
The 2018 SUPPORT Act, a landmark law meant to provide prevention, treatment and recovery for people with opioid addiction, gave states a new, albeit temporary, choice to provide care in psychiatric hospitals for up to a month without having to obtain a waiver.
That option, which only South Dakota and Tennessee have taken, expired in September. The SUPPORT Act reauthorization bill the House passed in mid-December would reup the option and make it permanent.
Pallone argued at a House Energy and Commerce hearing this summer that the low uptake showed that the waivers were sufficient. But Burgess and other Republicans said the waivers were burdensome and that making the option permanent would incentivize more states to use it.
The Senate Finance Committee also voted in November to 
make the option permanent. Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), 
who introduced the legislation with Republican Sens. John Thune of South Dakota and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, emphasized the 30-day limit and the requirement to provide medication. She described medication treatment using drugs like buprenorphine to wean patients off stronger opioids as the gold standard for treating addiction.
Its a rare issue on which Republicans arent at odds with the public health establishment.
A repeal of the funding ban wouldnt mean a return to the 1965 mental health care model because that is just not where the system is today, thats not where the clinical understanding is today and thats not where any of the conversation is today, said Jack Rollins, the director of federal policy at the National Association of Medicaid Directors.
Forced care and the slippery slope
But theres still a powerful perception among many in the public that mental hospitals are akin to prisons and that opening the door to voluntary care will lead to forced treatment.
When some people think of mental hospitals, they see the one in One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, the 1962 novel by Ken Kesey, or its 1975 film adaptation in which Jack Nicholson played a patient who was saner than the nurse caring for him.
A faulty assumption is that [mental health institutions] are like therapeutic settings. We know theres a history in this country of institutions not being particularly therapeutic places, Bazelon Center for Mental Health Laws Bossing said.
He pointed to reports in recent years from Washingtons disability rights watchdog alleging abuse and neglect at 
one public and 
one private mental health hospital in the capital. Representatives of the institutions said they were investigating the accusations and would make changes if necessary.
In 2021, 
Virginia announced and quickly reversed a decision to close five of the states eight psychiatric hospitals to new admissions due to overcrowding and understaffing.
And reinstitutionalization, albeit on a small scale, is happening.
New York has sent about 130 people per week, involuntarily, to hospitals for psychiatric evaluation since May as part of a plan by Mayor Eric Adams to treat people who are unable to meet their basic needs.
On the other side of the country, California Gov. Gavin Newsom 
has included ways to compel people into care in his mental health system overhaul. In March, Californians will decide on a $6.4 billion bond proposal Newsom has pitched to build nearly 25,000 psychiatric and addiction beds.
Representatives of community mental health organizations in California plan to oppose the changes.
In New York City, a group of civil rights lawyers filed a class-action suit against Adams directive and want more data on its implementation to see whether its disproportionately affecting people of color.

Weighing the politics
Still, Newsom and Adams are reacting to growing public and political pressure caused by a massive crisis of homelessness and drug addiction.
Drug use spiked during the Covid pandemic, as evidenced by the record levels of fatal overdoses now more than 100,000 a year.
Homelessness 
rose by 12 percent between 2022 and 2023 nationwide as rents surged and pandemic-era aid ended. More than 650,000 people were experiencing homelessness on a single night in January 2023, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
California is home to the most unhoused people of any state some 181,000 people followed by New York, with some 103,000.
Politicians fear open-air drug markets and tent encampments in their cities could hurt them at election time.
And theyre increasingly confident that caring for more of those suffering on the streets in mental hospitals wont become a similar political liability.
It doesnt have to become a warehouse, you know, One Flew Over a Cuckoos Nest. Absolutely not.
