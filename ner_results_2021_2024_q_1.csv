"{'Both cigarettes and opioids are highly addictive—and potentially deadly. Both substances are sold by profiteering companies using science distorted by spin or outright lies. And both have been the subjects of multi-billion-dollar lawsuits.\r\nBut opioids are not cigarettes. And as the opioid settlements finally near completion, it is crucial not to misapply lessons learned from tobacco. Fundamentally, this means accepting that—unlike cigarettes—opioids have genuine uses in both pain and addiction medicine.\r\nSo far, however, we are doing the opposite. Rather than recognizing that some people with intractable pain benefit from opioids, we continue to reduce access— typically without offering affordable and effective alternatives.\r\nRather than acknowledging that closing “pill mills” and identifying “doctor shoppers” more often drives people to dangerous street drugs than to recovery, we frequently abandon patients in withdrawal. And instead of admitting that the best treatment for opioid addiction—the only one proved to cut the death rate by 50 percent or more—is medical opioids (typically buprenorphine or methadone, but some countries use heroin), we primarily offer abstinence-based treatment.\r\nUnderstanding where the analogy between opioids and cigarettes holds—and where it goes astray—can guide better policy.\r\nFirst, unlike for cigarettes, interrupting the opioid supply can kill rather than cure. One recent study of more than 100,000 patients published in JAMA examined dose reductions among people who had taken opioids for at least a year. Researchers expected these cuts to lower overdose risk.\r\nInstead, regardless of how quickly or slowly drugs were tapered, opioid reduction nearly doubled the odds that patients would overdose. And compared with those whose dosages were stable, these patients had more than twice the risk of hospitalization for psychiatric problems, including suicide attempts.\r\nEarlier research bolsters these findings. One study found that patients who had their doses lowered rapidly were nearly four times more likely to die by suicide. Another study, conducted with veterans, showed that abrupt cessation hiked suicide risk by a factor of seven for those who had received opioids long term.\r\nBecause five million to eight million Americans currently take opioids for chronic pain, these data suggest that many of today’s overdose and suicide cases may actually result from our attempts to ameliorate the crisis.\r\nBy contrast, quitting smoking enhances life expectancy (though it can sometimes increase depression in vulnerable populations). And even so, our strategies for fighting Big Tobacco have not involved making cigarettes legally inaccessible to current smokers. Indeed, banning cigarettes outright—or making them available only by increasingly difficult to obtain prescriptions—was not even on the table during settlement talks because regulators appreciated that this would create a large, dangerous black market.\r\nThe same caution was not applied to opioids. Since 2011 prescribing has fallen by at least 60 percent, largely thanks to ramped up prescription-monitoring databases and prosecution of “pill mill” physicians. The crackdown scared even legitimate doctors into dropping chronic pain patients—as well as anyone else who might possibly be addicted.\r\nNot surprisingly, this created a bonanza for dealers—whose products, unlike legal drugs, are unregulated and vary widely in dosage and purity. Consequently, as prescribing dropped, overdose deaths more than doubled, reaching a record high of more than 93,000 in 2020.\r\nYet antiopioid crusaders have dug in their heels, continuing to take the wrong lessons from tobacco’s history. Big Pharma lied about opioid benefits, just as Big Tobacco lied about cigarettes. Therefore, they argued, any positive claims about opioids must be squelched and the medical supply must fall even further.\r\nThis approach obscures facts about addiction that are critical to prevention and treatment. For one, most opioid addiction does not start with medical care. Eighty percent of people who begin misusing prescription opioids get them from friends, family or other illegal sources, not physicians—and nearly all those who become addicted have already used other drugs such as cocaine or methamphetamine.\r\nMoreover, addictions typically start in youth, with 90 percent beginning as experimentation in adolescence or early adulthood. Chronic pain, in contrast, tends to arise in middle or late life.\r\nAs a result, fewer than 8 percent of people who take opioids long term for pain develop new addictions, according to a review co-authored by the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. In fact, the age group prescribed opioids at the highest rate—those older than 65—has the lowest rate of addiction and overdose. (And no, this research was not funded by Big Pharma, even though they used some of it extremely dishonestly.)\r\nIt is difficult to stop drug-seeking teens by leaving grandma in agony. Policies aimed at minimizing leftover pills prescribed for acute pain make sense—as does providing secure storage for needed meds. But our current strategy of reducing prescribing for chronic pain has failed.\r\nWhile care is needed when applying tobacco history to opioid policy, the settlements do offer one clear cautionary lesson: use the money well.\r\nSome $246 billion has already been paid out by cigarette makers—but nearly all of it falls into states’ general funds. In the 2021 fiscal year, for instance, less than 3 percent of the $27 billion allocated goes directly to smoking cessation and prevention.\r\nTo do better, we must target opioid funds narrowly and spend them smartly. This means moving away from cutting supply and toward offering help.\r\nFirst, doctors must be allowed to continue prescribing forpatients who already take opioids—without fear that doing so responsibly will cost them their license or their freedom. The millions of “legacy patients”—and future patients who have exhausted other options—need a legal safe haven so that they are not killed by dose reductions intended to save them.\r\nSecond, people with addiction need better care: arrest or expulsion from medical practices because of suspicion of misuse is not treatment. When physicians diagnose opioid addiction, they should legally be able to prescribe methadone or buprenorphine on the spot rather than having to send patients to restrictive clinics. In addition, no rehab that fails to offer medications or disparages them should receive government or insurance funding.\r\nIn short, we need to spend settlement funds on proved, effective care—and stop prioritizing\r\nprescription monitoring and enforcement. Despite their dangers, there is currently no substitute for these drugs. While a world without smoking is desirable, one without opioids is a world of pain.\r\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.': ""{'PERSON': ['None'], 'DATE': ['2021'], 'LOC': ['None'], 'ORG': ['Big Tobacco', 'Big Pharma', 'National Institute on Drug Abuse', 'Scientific American'], 'PROGRAMS': ['None'], 'IMPACT': ['interrupting the opioid supply can kill rather than cure', 'rapid dose lowering increased risk of suicide', 'strict prescription monitoring led to increase in black market activities', 'overdose deaths more than doubled as prescription dropped', 'reducing prescribing for chronic pain has failed', 'dose reductions intended to save them']}}""}"

"{'Part 1\xa0of a five-part USA TODAY series exploring\xa0chronic pain, the challenges of treatment\xa0and the scientific advances offering hope for the future.\xa0\r\nEvery morning, even before opening her eyes, Pamela Bobb begins to scan her body. She pays attention to how each foot feels, then each leg, working her way up. By the time she gets to her neck and shoulders, where people hold most of their tension, she\'s breathing deeply and relaxing.\r\nShe knows the shooting pain will strike as soon as her feet reach the floor, but this 20 minutes of meditative thinking and breathing means less misery to start her day.\r\nBobb, 59, who lives west of Knoxville, Tennessee, has never known life without pain. Born with a malformed pelvis, she had surgery within a day of delivery, and 18 more pelvic operations before she turned 40, until finally,\xa0there was nothing more surgeons could do.\r\nEvery day since ""every single minute of every day since"" Bobb has felt as if there\'s a rubber band stretched tightly between her belly button and her back.\r\nMany Americans know all too well the reality of such endless suffering.\xa0\r\nAt least\xa01 in 5 live\xa0with chronic pain. Some experts put the figure at 100 million. And nearly 1 in 10 are\xa0disabled by it.\r\nOn any given day, almost half of working-age men who are not in the labor force take pain medication,\xa0and people with chronic pain miss nine more days of work a year than those without it.\r\nPain is also expensive. Pain treatment cost $261 billion to $300 billion in 2010, and the cost has only grown.\xa0Add the value of days of work missed, hours of work lost and lower wages, and the total price of pain exceeds the cost of managing\xa0heart disease\xa0and cancer combined.\r\nTo better understand America\'s pain problem, USA TODAY spoke with more than 50 pain experts anesthesiologists, neurologists, psychologists, geneticists and people living with chronic pain. The reporting resulted in this\xa0five-part series exploring\xa0the reality of pain, pain medications,\xa0nondrug alternatives for children and adults, and scientific advances offering hope for the future.\r\nThe vast majority of chronic pain patients will have stories about providers who have been dismissive, said Dr. Tina\xa0Doshi, a pain expert at the\xa0Johns Hopkins\xa0University School of Medicine.\r\nThey are told their pain is imagined, all in their head. But advanced brain imaging has shown that those with chronic pain have clear differences in their brain activity.\r\n""They\'re not making it up. This is not a psychological\xa0disorder,"" said Dr. Clifford Woolf, a neurobiologist at Boston Children\'s Hospital. ""Their nervous system is malfunctioning or there\'s a chronic, persistent pathology which is driving the pain.""\r\nPain\xa0is often unrelenting.\xa0\r\nA new study of Britons born in 1958 and followed ever since\xa0shows that pain in childhood predicted pain in midlife. More than 80% of those who said they were in chronic pain at age 44 reported\xa0very severe pain at age 50.\r\n""Where you were in your pain journey a long time ago continues to affect your life course in an adverse way,"" said Alex Bryson,\xa0the University College London\xa0researcher who helped lead the study.\r\nHaving chronic pain at age 44 also significantly raised\xa0the probability patients\xa0would get COVID-19 in their early 60s, showing that ""even getting COVID is partly a function of the pain you\'ve experienced over your life course,"" he said.\r\nThe opioid epidemic is inseparable from the pain\xa0crisis.\xa0\r\nPeople often start\xa0taking the painkillers on a doctor\'s order, after a surgery or an injury, and then need more and more to get the same benefit. At least\xa0100,000 people died from drug overdoses last year, most of them from opioids, a dramatic increase from\xa040,000\xa0deaths\xa0five years earlier. Experts believe opioid addiction only increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nYet nothing else is as effective at treating excruciating pain. Efforts to keep\xa0opioids off the street have often gone overboard, experts say, depriving those in real need.\r\nPamela Bobb of Tennessee, has been in pain her whole life. She manages it with a combination of meditative breathing, diet, exercise, yoga and medications.\r\nTamara Reynolds, For USA TODAY\r\nPatients like Bobb and others\xa0say they shouldn\'t be treated as addicts looking for a fix, but rather\xa0as people with a serious medical problem that needs attention and support.\r\nRobert Kerns\r\nCourtesy Robert Kerns\r\nFederal guidance, updated last month, makes it clear that unless there\'s a life-threatening\xa0issue such as signs of overdose, doctors should not abruptly discontinue or rapidly reduce\xa0opioid dosages.\xa0After an earlier set of guidelines restricted opioid use even among those in severe chronic pain,\xa0an online survey of about 3,000 patients\xa0found 84% reported more pain and worse quality of life, and 42% said they had considered suicide.\r\n""Separate\xa0but related to the opioid crisis is the public health crisis of undermanaged pain,"" said Robert Kerns, an expert in chronic pain at Yale University, noting that every drugstore in American has an entire aisle devoted to painkillers. ""This is a very serious public health concern.""\r\nAfter Bobb gritted\xa0her way through her 30s and 40s, her pain eventually became unbearable. In 2004, her doctor prescribed\xa0high doses of opioids. She didn\'t develop an addiction, but she didn\'t like what the opioids did to her brain and how they made her feel like a victim. ""I wasn\'t really living. I was just kind of existing,"" she said.\r\nEven when opioids don\'t lead to addiction, as they do in about 10% of people, they have side effects. Terrible constipation is common, as are nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, powerfully itchy skin\xa0and feelings of sedation\xa0 sleepwalking through life.\r\nAbout five years ago, Bobb, a nurse\xa0now semi-retired, decided she needed to take a different\xa0path.\r\nNow, every morning\xa0she washes a small dose of opioids down with an anti-inflammatory\xa0""special little concoction"" for breakfast, stir-frying fresh ginger, rosemary, basil, lemon juice and three cups of spinach.\r\nThe meditation, diet and other strategies have helped her\xa0cut her opioid use by about 75%.\xa0\r\nAll pain medications,\xa0including opioids,\xa0over-the-counter painkillers\xa0and nerve blockers, blunt\xa0but don\'t erase suffering. They often become inadequate over time or even contribute to the cycle of pain and desperate search for relief. Misused, every drug treatment\xa0can\xa0destroy\xa0organs and lives.\r\n""A cold hard look at what we have right now should depress anyone,"" said Jeffrey Mogil,\xa0who studies pain at McGill University in Montreal.\xa0\r\nDr. Nora Volkow\r\nKeren Carrion, USAT\r\nBut just because a pill can\'t solve chronic pain doesn\'t mean people are doomed to suffer forever,\xa0said Dr. Nora\xa0Volkow,\xa0who directs the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The institute is part of\xa0the National Institutes of Health, which has spent more than\xa0$600 million since 2020\xa0on pain research.\r\nMany approaches help reduce pain, and many people, like Bobb, manage to live full, vibrant lives, despite\xa0a background of discomfort. Non-pharmaceutical therapies including physical therapy, yoga, acupuncture and Bobb\'s meditative breathing have been shown effective at helping people cope with pain.\r\nWhile providers can offer guidance, support and access to certain kinds of care, fundamentally, people need to learn how to manage their own pain, Kerns said.\r\n""It\'s really about reinforcing the power of the person,"" he said, ""once they understand how much of the experience of pain is within their grasp.""\r\nPain is an essential part of life. It\'s protective and aids\xa0survival.\r\nIn a classic experiment, squid\xa0put in a tank with sea bass are less likely to get eaten if they\'re already in pain. The suffering makes the squid hypervigilant.\xa0""Pain is there to remind you you\'re injured so you don\'t take crazy chances,"" Mogil said.\r\nIsaac Chiu\r\nHarvard Medical School\r\nPain can be protective in other ways, too.\xa0Isaac Chiu, an immunologist at\xa0Harvard Medical School, recently showed\xa0that pain triggers the gut to release\xa0mucus, which coats the gut wall and prevents bacteria and other factors\xa0from\xa0causing\xa0damage.\xa0\r\nMice bred to not have pain fibers in their guts have decreased mucus, which makes them more susceptible to inflammation and colitis, Chiu found.\r\n""I don\'t want to have pain, but maybe in this case, the pain fibers in the gut are protecting us,"" he said.\r\nBut pain is not just the result of an immediate crisis, a twisted ankle, a burned finger, a broken limb. Chronic pain is defined as suffering that lasts more than three months\xa0 longer than it takes that\xa0ankle muscle to be restored, the finger to scab over and grow new skin, the bone to heal.\r\nSuch long-lasting misery\xa0has what\'s called a psychosocial aspect to it. Of course, unrelenting\xa0pain itself is depressing. But if your life is a dead end with few prospects for improvement, you\'re more likely to feel chronic pain. That hopelessness manifests in physical suffering.\r\nHow some Americans feel pain at the extremes: constantly, intensely, or never.\r\nFrom intense, chronic pain to no pain at all, some Americans experience that sharp sense of danger in a very different way.\r\nIt doesn\'t mean the pain is made up;\xa0rather, what\'s going on in your head can magnify or mitigate the sensation.\xa0A busy life full of compelling activities can distract from pain; a lonely life spent on the couch can compound it.\r\nThe high pain rates in the United States have a lot\xa0""to do with just poor general health in our country,"" said Dr. John Mafi,\xa0a\xa0primary care doctor and\xa0associate professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.\r\nPeople who have few financial resources\xa0or are from disadvantaged groups or both are more likely to have poorhealth, which contributes to pain. Obesity can trigger arthritis and low back problems; diabetes causes neuropathic pain; bad circulation can cause painful\xa0blocked arteries. Mental illness and stress exacerbate all kinds of pain, such as chronic migraine headaches. Limited or lack of health insurance coverage compounds all these problems.\r\n""We love to talk about magic pills in this country, but we don\'t ask enough: What are the social, psychosocial\xa0and economic\xa0root causes of this bigger issue?"" Mafi said.\xa0\r\nThe human nervous system has its own painkillers. Put your hand on a hot stove and your body will quickly release a squirt to numb the pain.\xa0\r\nFor thousands of years, maybe even longer, humans have relied on opioids in nature to supplement that innate pain relief. The ancient\xa0Sumerians\xa0and Greeks knew all about the pain-relieving potential of poppy seeds. Civil War veterans became addicted to opioids.\xa0\r\nStories about opium and morphine use from 1900 ""read just like today,"" Mafi said. ""It\'s crazy how much of this repeats over time.""\r\nIn the 1920s and \'30s, the federal government passed regulations restricting their use. Then in the 1980s and 1990s, amid\xa0a growing recognition that severe pain was undertreated,\xa0the pharmaceutical industry reassured the public that new twists on opioids, like oxycontin, were less addictive than earlier forms. ""We fell for it,"" Mafi said.\r\nOpioids are properly used as third- or fourth-line therapies in patients who cannot function normally without chronic pain relief, he said. He trains residents to consider opioids after determining the underlying cause of the chronic pain, other conservative approaches have failed, and when a patient\xa0says their pain prevents them from climbing stairs, showering, holding down a job or taking\xa0care of\xa0their kids or grandkids. If such activities of daily living are impaired, Mafi said, ""we would be a\xa0little more willing to continue opioids or prescribe the opioids.""\r\nMillions of people, prescribed courses of opioids for pain from sports injuries and other seemingly short-term sources of pain, began\xa0taking the drugs long-term, needing more and more to receive the same amount of pain relief.\r\nIn the early 2010s, as awareness of the problem rose, doctors stopped providing unlimited supplies. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended doctors ""deprescribe"" their patients, which led to unexpected consequences.\xa0\r\nDr. John Mafi\r\nAs it got harder to get prescribed opioids, people stopped trying to get it from their doctor and they started to go to the street. Thats when you started seeing a rise in heroin use and then later, illicit fentanyl use leading to a lot of the overdose deaths.\r\n""As it got harder to get prescribed opioids, people stopped trying to get it from their doctor and they started to go to the street,"" Mafi said. ""That\'s when you started seeing a rise in heroin use and then later, illicit fentanyl use leading to a lot of the overdose deaths."" By 2021, studies had\xa0linked aggressive deprescribing to an increased\xa0risk of overdose or death.\xa0\r\nIt used to take several years for a heroin\xa0addiction to lead to overdose and death. Now, with extremely potent fentanyl, people are overdosing as early as their first foray, Mafi said.\r\nThe opioid crisis resulted from aggressive promotion by pharmaceutical companies and others, overprescribing of opioid medications\xa0and\xa0a lack of investment in pain treatment research, Volkow said.\r\n""What the crisis brought to light is that we cannot continue to neglect the importance of research and facilitating the development of therapeutics for pain.""\r\nShe and other pain experts\xa0agree that there isn\'t much else to offer at the moment and that\xa0opioids are appropriate and necessary for people like Bobb, as well as for patients after surgery or trauma and those fighting the pain of advanced cancer.\r\nBut not everyone, even in the medical world, understands the correct use of opioids. Patients\' pain is often poorly controlled.\r\nBobb switched doctors after hers abruptly decided she shouldn\'t be taking opioids anymore. She\xa0now drives 110 miles each way every month to see a different\xa0physician\xa0and\xa0worries about the patients who\xa0can\'t make such choices.\xa0\r\nMany people ""don\'t understand that using opioids doesn\'t make you a criminal,"" Bobb said. ""There\'s a place for this. There\'s a usefulness for this.""\r\nJeffrey Mogil\xa0knows he\'s going against common wisdom when he says women are more sensitive to pain\xa0than men.\r\nBut the research is clear.\xa0""The evidence is as close to incontrovertible as anything gets in biology."" About 70% of chronic pain patients are women.\r\nJeffrey Mogil\r\nMcGill University\r\nDifferent genes and cells are involved in pain between\xa0the sexes. The immune system, the\xa0nervous system and the microbes that live on and in the body vary\xa0between males and females. ""It\'s just massively different,"" Mogil said, noting current treatments and drug\xa0development don\'t take account of that sex difference, with drugs often tested just in male mice.\r\nPain also differs by age.\r\n""The aging population has more sources of pain but the nervous system is not as healthy,"" so pain isn\'t felt as acutely,\xa0said Dr.\xa0Christopher Gharibo, a pain management specialist at NYU Langone. Older patients need less powerful pain medications. ""They\'re fine with physical therapy,"" he said.\xa0\r\nPain differs by race, too, though not in a simple way.\r\nChronic pain is felt pretty universally by all races, said Roger Fillingim,\xa0who directs the Pain Research and Intervention Center of Excellence\xa0at the University of Florida\'s College of Dentistry in Gainesville. But ""the burden of pain appears to be greater in Black individuals,"" he said, with more people of color suffering disabling pain.\r\nHistoric and current undertreatment of pain in Black people has been persistent and based on the false belief that\xa0they feel less pain.\r\nIn fact, Fillingim and others have found the opposite: Black people report\xa0higher levels of pain with the same stimulus and lower tolerance of a given pain stimulus compared with white people. Whether Black people need more powerful painkillers to get the same relief\xa0or just need to get the added stress of racism out of the equation isn\'t yet known, he said.\r\nCulture also affects pain.\r\nIn Mexico, people are rarely prescribed opioids, said Volkow, who grew up there, and the Catholic culture venerates pain as a way of proving faith. ""People\xa0are taught to tolerate pain at a level that is different from what it is in the United States,"" she said. ""There is absolutely a cultural element of how we manage pain and its significance.""\r\nThe indigenous Mi\'kmaq people, whose ancestral territory stretches across Nova Scotia, Canada, down to Quebec and into Maine, don\'t have a word in their native language\xa0for ""pain,"" and the pictures doctors show of grimacing faces to rate misery don\'t fit their experience.\r\nSharon Rudderham\r\nJohn Ratchford, Ratchford Photography\r\n""It goes right to the core of the disconnect,"" said Sharon Rudderham,\xa0a member of the Mi\'kmaq who is director of health transformation\xa0for the health organization Tajikeimik.\xa0""We\xa0are literally speaking a different language when it comes to pain.""\r\nProviders are taught to assess pain in children based on outward signs, such as crying and facial expression, but because of their history and negative experiences in Canadian residential schools, similar to American Indian boarding schools, many Mi\'kmaq, even very young children, remain reserved around doctors and nurses.""\xa0\r\n""As a health provider, if I\'m looking at children in an emergency department\xa0and one is crying and screaming and looking uncomfortable and one isn\'t, the one looking more uncomfortable may be triaged sooner,"" said Margot Latimer,\xa0a professor at the Dalhousie School of Nursing in Halifax, Canada.\r\nThe\xa0zero to 10 scale doctors use for patients to rate their pain\xa0can also be challenging, especially for those\xa0without\xa0much\xa0experience with the medical system, said Carmen Reneé Green,\xa0dean of the CUNY School of Medicine.\xa0\r\n""A zero\xa0to 10 scale makes great sense for clinicians, but it doesn\'t work well for patients in many, many cases,"" Green said, particularly those who have traditionally received substandard medical care.\r\n""All\xa0those histories come into how we perceive pain, how pain is assessed and how pain is treated,"" Green said. ""We\'ve got to do better.""\r\nAfter about 15 years of taking\xa0high-dose opioids, Bobb made an appointment with Dr. Wayne Jonas, an integrative health\xa0specialist in Virginia.\r\nHe taught her strategies to manage the pain that opioids weren\'t touching.\r\nBobb said her pain used to be at a 9 out of 10 all day every day. Now, it usually hovers around a 3. It\'s not gone, but it\'s not paralyzing either.\xa0\r\nAfter her light dose of opioids\xa0and anti-inflammatory breakfast, Bobb allows herself an hour to move.\r\nDepending on how she feels that day, she might go for a brisk walk on her treadmill, do yoga\xa0or meditate some more. Exercise, she said, ""helps\xa0me to be at that level where I can function well.""\xa0\r\nPeace, diet &amp; meditation: how one chronic pain patient has learned to deal with discomfort\r\nChronic pain can be invisible, constant, and unbearable. Pamela Bobb, of Eastern Tennessee, has never known life without it.\r\nShe drinks water throughout the day and notices that her pain is worse if she doesn\'t sleep enough.\r\nIf her pain does start to\xa0wear\xa0her down, Bobb takes a time-out in her favorite chair. ""My space, my corner, my view, and just bring it down. Just bring it down.""\r\nFiguring out how to do what was best for her body took about a decade of trial and error. Time, energy and attitude change are all essential, she said, plus prioritizing self-care.\xa0\r\n""The key is stopping, turning, facing it, feeling it in all of its glory. Feeling every aspect of it and coming up with a way to say:\xa0\'No, no.\xa0The pain doesn\'t win,\'"" Bobb said.\xa0\r\nShe wishes other people coping with chronic pain could have the advantages she\'s had: a good doctor, attentive nurses, the time and resources to take care of herself. And most of all, hope.\r\n""If someone can understand that having a sense of empowerment over the pain by learning everything you can to treat it, to control it,"" she said, ""maybe they won\'t feel as overwhelmed and hopeless.""\r\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com.\r\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

"{'Narcan, the nasal spray that can stop opioid overdoses as they are happening, will soon be sold over the counter. | Getty Images\r\n\n \n\n Over-the-counter Narcan is a big win for slowing overdose deaths. But there is more to do. A long-sought tool in the fight against America’s opioid crisis is becoming available later this year: Narcan, the nasal spray that can stop opioid overdoses as they are happening, will finally be sold over the counter.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the change on Wednesday, a regulatory overhaul that patient advocates and community health groups have been pushing for. Emergent BioSolutions, the manufacturer of Narcan, said the product should be stocked on store shelves by the end of the summer.\nIt’s a welcome sign of progress amid America’s worsening opioid crisis. Nationally, nearly 107,000 Americans died after overdosing on some kind of drug in 2021, up from about 92,000 in 2020 and 70,600 in 2019. The majority of those overdoses involved opioids and specifically fentanyl, the synthetic opioid that is much more potent than heroin and has become ubiquitous in the country’s drug supply over the past decade, contributing to the increasing number of overdose deaths.\nNarcan, the first-of-its-kind spray version of the anti-overdose medication naloxone, is remarkably effective at stopping overdoses. The drug blocks the receptors in a person’s brain that are targeted by opioids, reversing the dramatic slowdown in respiration that can lead to sudden death. It works quickly, within two to three minutes of being administered.\nNearly 17 million doses of naloxone were distributed nationwide in 2021, according to a report from the Reagan-Udall Foundation on behalf of the FDA, continuing a surge in the drug’s availability since Narcan first debuted in 2015. Previous studies have found that the expansion of naloxone access decreased opioid overdose deaths by 10 percent or more in state and local jurisdictions that tried to make the drug more available.\nBut despite that progress, the United States has still been struggling to get naloxone into the hands of people who really need it. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly half of overdose deaths in 2021 occurred with another person nearby who could have potentially intervened. Public health advocates have also long encouraged the co-prescribing of naloxone and prescription opioids, but that’s still extremely rare.\nTwo problems have stood in the way of getting Narcan to people who may depend on it to save their life: stigma and cost. The FDA’s decision to allow Narcan sales over the counter could help to address the first, but may not do much on the second — with a current retail price of $50 or more, cost is still a factor. This week’s news is a step in the right direction, but far from the end of America’s battle to prevent drug overdose deaths.\nHow making Narcan available over the counter could help prevent overdose deaths\nBefore Wednesday’s FDA decision, Narcan was already available at retail pharmacies nationwide. Almost every state had issued a standing order to pharmacists, allowing them to distribute the drug to anyone who asks for it.\nBut that required people to be comfortable approaching the pharmacy desk and making that request, which implies that either they or someone in their life is abusing drugs. Some people also reportedly worried about the information being shared with their health insurer if they produced an insurance card, even though most insurers have been covering Narcan at no cost to the patient. They might also need to pay for it, and 20 percent of people with substance use disorder do not have health insurance, according to the Reagan-Udall Foundation. That means they would have to pay the full price in order to get naloxone.\nTellingly, out of those 17 million naloxone doses that were distributed in 2021, only a small share, about 2.6 million, passed through retail pharmacies. The other 14 million-plus doses were provided to patients by other medical providers, such as doctors and hospitals, or other groups such as health departments, harm reduction groups, first responders, schools, and community health organizations.\nMaking Narcan available over the counter, instead of requiring somebody to confer with a pharmacist, should help to reduce the risk that stigma will prevent somebody from obtaining the drug in the first place. CVS and Walgreens, the country’s two largest retail pharmacy chains, said they both plan to stock their shelves with Narcan as soon as the over-the-counter version becomes available.\nIn addition, convenience stores, gas stations, and other retail stores will now be able to carry Narcan. New York City is planning to set up vending machines with two packs of Narcan.\nThat should make it easier to put Narcan in the hands of people who need it. The FDA determined, as part of its decision this week, that Narcan is simple enough to be used with appropriate instructions on its packaging. Some experts do worry that the opportunity to educate users will be missed by cutting out pharmacists, so here are some general tips:\n<ul>\n<li>\nSigns of an overdose include a person being non-responsive, having slowed or stopped breathing, becoming purple or blue in their extremities, and their pupils becoming small</li>\n<li>To administer a dose of Narcan, lean the person’s head back and insert the spray plunger into one of their nostrils, then press to administer the dose</li>\n<li>After administering the medicine, call 9-1-1</li>\n<li>If the person does not respond within a few minutes of the first dose being administered, a second dose may be necessary</li>\n</ul>\nBut while the FDA’s decision should remove some barriers to naloxone access, it has not eliminated them entirely.\nThe barriers that still exist to getting Narcan to the people who need it\nThe primary obstacle remaining to naloxone access is cost. Emergent BioSolutions did not immediately say what price it would set for over-the-counter Narcan, but the drug currently retails between $50 and $100, according to news reports.\nPrevious research has found that costs as low as $10 can prevent people from buying medications that they need. That may prove especially true for people who are using — and therefore purchasing — illicit substances. \nAs one recovery specialist in Minnesota who himself was in recovery told the Associated Press: “There was no way I would spend $10 for something to save my life when I needed that money to buy drugs.”\nStakeholders convened by the Addiction Policy Forum suggested a top-end price of $20 per unit, with a suggested retail price between $5 and $20, in order to prevent cost from being a barrier to people obtaining the medication.\nHealth insurance generally covers Narcan for free or a minimal copay with a prescription, but health insurance does not typically cover over-the-counter medications. Public health advocates are urging insurers to continue covering the over-the-counter version at zero cost, but it remains to be seen whether they will. That would still raise the possibility that people will choose not to purchase the drug rather than alert their health insurer that they or somebody in their household is using drugs.\nUltimately, cheaper versions of Narcan and other forms of naloxone would help to solve the cost crisis and this week’s FDA decision may open the door for their approval.\nHarm Reduction Therapeutics has already asked the FDA to approve its naloxone spray for over-the-counter sales, and experts said the agency’s decision on Narcan likely opened the door for that product’s approval. Generic competition would also help to reduce the sticker prices for people purchasing the drug directly off the shelf.\nPublic health experts are also urging the government to make other forms of naloxone available over the counter. Liquid vials of the medication, sold with syringes, can often be much cheaper (as little as $4) than the spray version and, according to people who work in recovery, are sometimes preferred by people familiar with syringe use because of their drug abuse.\nSo there is still work to be done to make naloxone as widely available as possible. And the need is only growing more urgent.\nNarcan is more important than ever as fentanyl rips through the US\nDrug overdose deaths have been steadily rising for the past two decades. About 20,000 Americans died of overdoses in 2000, a fifth of the lives lost by 2021. Part of the problem is the proliferation of dependency, something that began with the over-prescription of opioids starting in the 1990s.\nBut the other problem is the increased potency of the drugs that people are taking.\nIn the mid-2000s, most overdose deaths were from commonly prescribed opioids, the most well-known version of which is OxyContin. People either took too many pills after getting a prescription because of an injury or chronic pain, or those drugs entered into the black market.\nBut by the 2010s, the opioid crisis started to change. Between the high costs associated with prescription opioids and government efforts to begin restricting their supply, heroin started to become the drug of choice. Criminal drug gangs seized on the opportunity to bring that cheaper alternative to America, as was chronicled in Sam Quinones’s 2016 book Dreamland.\nBy the middle of the last decade, commonly prescribed opioids and heroin were almost even in the number of overdose deaths attributed to them. But another culprit was quickly picking up momentum: synthetic opioids, the best known of which is fentanyl. Over the past 10 years, those drugs have become by far the most common cause of overdose death in the US. \n \n \n Reagan-Udall Foundation\n \nFentanyl is now the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18 to 49. On the same day as the FDA’s Narcan decision, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told a Senate committee that fentanyl was the “single greatest challenge we face as a country.” The drug is 50 times more potent than heroin but cheap to manufacture. Mexican drug cartels have been producing fentanyl and smuggling it into the US in increasing quantities since 2015, sometimes selling illicit pills for as little as $5 each.\nThat increase in supply has coincided with a growing number of overdose deaths every year, which accelerated even further during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation.\nSlowing that loss of life will be a long and multi-pronged project, covering everything from border security to criminal justice to public health. This week’s FDA decision is an important step in the right direction. But the work goes on.': ""{'PERSON': ['Getty Images', 'Alejandro Mayorkas'], 'DATE': ['Wednesday', 'later this year', 'the end of the summer', '2021', '2020', '2019', '2015', 'this week', 'the past decade', 'the past two decades', '2000', 'the mid-2000s', 'the 2010s', 'the last decade', 'the same day'], 'LOC': ['America', 'US', 'United States', 'New York City', 'Minnesota'], 'ORG': ['Food and Drug Administration', 'FDA', 'Emergent BioSolutions', 'Reagan-Udall Foundation', 'US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'CVS', 'Walgreens', 'Addiction Policy Forum', 'Harm Reduction Therapeutics', 'Senate committee', 'Homeland Security', 'Kaiser Family Foundation'], 'PROGRAMS': ['Over-the-counter Narcan', 'Narcan', 'resource hub'], 'IMPACT': ['stop opioid overdoses', 'slowing overdose deaths', 'decreased opioid overdose deaths by 10 percent', 'reducing the risk of stigma', 'reduce the sticker prices', 'help to solve the cost crisis', 'slowing the loss of life']}""}"
"{""In one way or another, Thomas Gooch has spent more than 30 years struggling with illegal drugs. The 52-year-old Nashville, Tenn., native grew up in extreme poverty. He was first incarcerated in 1988 and spent the next 15 years in and out of jail for using and selling narcotics. “Until 2003,” Gooch says. “That was the first time I went to treatment and the last time I used.” Since then, for most of 19 years, Gooch has been trying to get others into recovery or just keep them alive. He handed out clean needles and injection-drug equipment—which reduce injuries, infections and overdose deaths—in Nashville’s hardest-hit communities. In 2014 he founded My Father’s House, a transitional recovery facility for fathers struggling with substance use disorder.\r\nBut despite Gooch’s long experience, the opioid epidemic recently has brought a level of devastation to the Black community that has shocked him. “I had never seen death the way I’ve seen death when it comes to opioid addiction,” he says. “There’s been so many funerals, it doesn’t even make sense. I personally know at least 50 to 60 individuals who died from overdoses in the last 10 years.” That staggering body count includes Gooch’s recently estranged wife in 2020 and a former partner in 2019.\r\nA million people in the U.S. have died of opioid overdoses since the 1990s. But the face—and race—of the opioid epidemic has changed in the past decade. Originally white and middle class, victims are now Black and brown people struggling with long-term addictions and too few resources. During 10 brutal years, opioid and stimulant deaths have increased 575 percent among Black Americans. In 2019 the overall drug overdose death rate among Black people exceeded that of whites for the first time: 36.8 versus 31.6 per 100,000. And with the addition of fentanyl, the synthetic opioid that’s 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine, Black men older than 55 who survived for decades with a heroin addiction are dying at rates four times greater than people of other races in that age group.\r\nThe reasons for this dramatic change come down to racial inequities. Research shows that Black people have a harder time getting into treatment programs than white people do, and Black people are less likely to be prescribed the gold standard medications for substance use therapy. “If you are a Black person and have an opioid use disorder, you are likely to receive treatment five years later than if you’re a white person,” says Nora D. Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of Health. “Treatments are extraordinarily useful in terms of preventing overdose death so you can actually recover. Five years can make the difference between being alive or not.” Black people with substance use problems are afraid of being caught up in a punitive criminal justice system and are less likely to have insurance good enough to allow them to seek help on their own. And the COVID pandemic disrupted many recovery and harm-reduction services, particularly for people of color.\r\nGooch blames straight-out racial discrimination in the health-care system, too. “When we call different places to try to get people into treatment, the question they ask is ‘What drug do they use?’” he recounts with exasperation. “If you say ‘crack,’ all of a sudden they ain’t got no bed available. If you say opioids and heroin, they will find a bed because that’s the demographic they want. A couple of times I told patients that the only way they’re going to get help is to get drunk and turn themselves into Vanderbilt Hospital because Vanderbilt will hold them for five days, and that’ll get them into treatment.”\r\nGooch is one of the people trying to improve access to therapies for addiction and change the overall dysfunctional dynamic. Other groups are bringing more effective addiction treatments within prison walls, reducing the chances of recidivism on release. A proposed federal law would make therapy with the commonly used addiction medication methadone less onerous for an impoverished population, as well as less stigmatizing. And Volkow is using her platform at the NIH to highlight the overwhelming research-based evidence for better ways to understand and treat addiction.\r\nLoftin Wilson, program manager for the NC Harm Reduction Coalition in Durham, N.C., uses his van (first image) to reach people with substance use disorders. He gives out supplies, including opioid overdose rescue kits (forth image), safe single-use cookers for drug injections (third image), and condoms (second image). Credit:\xa0Gioncarlo Valentine\r\nAccess to Treatment\r\nThe nation’s historic reluctance to treat addiction as a health-care issue rather than a criminal justice one has resulted in a health-care system where too few people of any race—just 10 percent—receive treatment for substance use disorder. Several factors, such as stigma and an inability to afford or access care, make the numbers considerably more dismal among people of color. Even after a nonfatal overdose, Black patients are half as likely to be referred to or access treatment as non-Hispanic white patients, according to federal government data.\r\nA growing recognition that criminalization and incarceration do little to curb illegal drug use or improve public health or safety has led to harm-reduction policies such as Good Samaritan laws—statutes that provide limited immunity for low-level drug violations and increase availability of naloxone, a drug that can reverse overdose. But racial disparities have emerged in the application and effectiveness of both measures. A study from RTI International found that Black and Latino intravenous drug users have inequitable access to the medication.\r\nYvonne Alloway, who has opioid use disorder, sits in her doctor's Washington, D.C., office after being treated with Suboxone. The medication reduces dependence on opioids and decreases the severity of withdrawal symptoms. Credit:\xa0Gioncarlo Valentine\r\nLoftin Wilson, program manager for the NC Harm Reduction Coalition in Durham, N.C., who has worked in the field for more than a decade, says the problems with inequality lead to distrust in the system, which creates a vicious cycle in which people who need help won’t go to institutions that can provide help. People entering treatment worry, with good reason, that dealing with the social service system can cause them to lose their employment, housing or even custody of their children. “That’s another example of the negative experiences people who use drugs have. They definitely don’t land equally on everybody, and people don’t experience them all the same way. It is a vastly different experience to be a Black drug user seeking health care than for a white person,” Wilson says.\r\nUniversity of Cincinnati psychologist Kathleen Burlew notes, as Volkow does, that when Black patients enter treatment, they are more likely to do so later than white people and are less likely to complete it. In addition to mistrust, she says, the less favorable outcomes result from factors such as clinician bias and lack of racial and ethnic diversity among treatment providers.\r\nFederal resources, such as grants to support local opioid use disorder clinics and programs, also tend to favor white populations. According to 2021 data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 77 percent of the clients treated with grant funding were white, 12.9 percent were Black and 2.8 percent were Native American. The disparity is even more pronounced in some states. For example, in 2019 North Carolina announced that white people made up 88 percent of those served by its $54-million federal grant, compared with 7.5 percent for Black people. Native Americans accounted for less than 1 percent of those served.\r\nMedication Inequality\r\nResearch has shown that there is a bias among health-care providers against using medication-assisted treatment (MAT), which combines FDA-approved drugs with counseling and behavioral therapies. Substance use specialists consider it the best approach to the opioid use problem. Yet a study published in JAMA Network found that about 40 percent of the 368 U.S. residential drug programs surveyed did not offer MAT, and 21 percent actively discouraged people from using it. Many addiction treatment programs are faith-based and see addiction as a moral problem, which leads to the conclusion that relying on medication for abstinence or sobriety simply trades one form of addiction for another. Many general practitioners who lack training in addiction medicine have this misconception.\r\nThe three medications approved by the FDA are buprenorphine, methadone and naltrexone. Buprenorphine and methadone are synthetic opioids that block brain opioid receptors and reduce both cravings and withdrawal. Naltrexone is a postdetox monthly injectable that blocks the effects of opioids. Very few insurance providers in the U.S. cover all three medications, and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the full range of medications is far less available to Black people.\r\nResearch suggests that economics and race influence who receives which medications. Buprenorphine, for instance, is more widely available in counties with predominantly white communities, whereas methadone clinics are usually located in poor communities of color.\r\nCredit: Jen Christiansen (charts); “Evaluation of Increases in Drug Overdose Mortality Rates in the US by Race and Ethnicity before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic,” by Joseph R. Friedman and Helena Hansen, in JAMA Psychiatry, Vol. 79; March 2022 (drug overdose data); “African Americans Now Outpace Whites in Opioid-Involved Overdose Deaths: A Comparison of Temporal Trends from 1999 to 2018,” by Debra Furr-Holden et al., in Addiction, Vol. 116; March 2021 (opioid-involved death rate data)\r\nTo use methadone, patients must make daily visits to a clinic to receive and take the medication under the supervision of a practitioner. This requirement makes it difficult to do things that build a normal life, such as attending school and obtaining and maintaining a job. There is also the stigma of standing in a public line known to everyone passing by as a queue for addiction treatment. “The treatment model was developed [during the Nixon administration] based on racism and a stigmatized view of people with addiction without any thought of privacy or dignity or treating addiction like a health problem,” says Andrew Kolodny, medical director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative at Brandeis University. The stigma is made worse by methadone’s classification as a Schedule II controlled substance, which is defined as a substance with a high potential for abuse, potentially leading to severe psychological or physical dependence. This categorization pushed the medication into a quasicriminalized status and the clinics into minority communities.\r\nBuprenorphine, however, is a completely different story. When opioid use problems increased in white communities, Congress acted to create less stigmatizing treatment options. The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (“DATA 2000”) lifted an 86-year ban that prevented treating opioid addiction with narcotic medications such as buprenorphine, which today is sold under the brand names Subutex and Suboxone. The majority of doctors who got special federal licenses to prescribe it accept only commercial health insurance and cash, so the drug is usually offered to a more affluent population, which in the U.S. means white people. About 95 percent of buprenorphine patients are white, and 34 percent have private insurance, according to a national study of data through 2015.\r\nJohn Woodyear is an addiction treatment specialist in Troy, a small rural town in south central North Carolina where the epidemic is exacting an increasingly heavy toll on the Black and Native American populations. Overall overdose death rates increased 40 percent from 2019 to 2020, but death rates among those two groups in particular went up 66 and 93 percent, respectively. Yet Woodyear, who is Black and practices in a town that is 31 percent Black, says his patients are 90 percent white. People come to the clinic through word of mouth or referrals from friends. As long as Woodyear’s patients are mostly white, new patients will be mostly white as well, he says.\r\nOne exception to this racial pattern is Edwin Chapman’s clinic in the Northeast neighborhood of Washington, D.C., one of the district’s predominantly Black and most impoverished communities. Chapman, a physician, often prescribes buprenorphine to his patients with opioid use problems, and the overwhelming majority of them are Black. He says that to prescribe the drug, physicians like him must get past certain roadblocks. “The insurance companies in many states put more restrictions on patients in an urban setting, such as requiring prior authorization for addiction treatment,” he says. Further, “to increase the dose above 16 or 24 milligrams, you may have to get a prior authorization. The dosing standards were based on the white population and people who were addicted to pills. Our surviving Black population often needs a higher dose of buprenorphine.”\r\nEdward Chapman, a doctor in Washington, D.C., treats patients with opioid use disorder in his office. He offers them medication-assisted treatment such as buprenorphine, which blocks opioid receptors in the brain. Credit:\xa0Gioncarlo Valentine\r\nChapman says few physicians in private practice are willing to treat these patients. “They don’t really feel comfortable having these patients in their office, or they aren’t really prepared to deal with the economic and mental health issues that come with this population,” he explains; those disorders include bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, among others.\r\nPeople have their own biases that keep them away from medication such as buprenorphine, Wilson says. Many view it as simply trading one drug for another. “They think, ‘If I’m going to take this step, why not just go to detox and not take any medications at all?’” he says. “There’s a big cultural misunderstanding about the fact that [these] medications are the only evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder. Short-term detox isn’t the most appropriate intervention for most people.”\r\nGooch agrees that the bias is real. He facilitates recovery groups at a program operated by a group from Meharry Medical College, a historically Black institution. Yet “I haven’t seen one Black person yet,” Gooch says. “Some think it’s a setup. There’s so much distrust, they have a hard time thinking it’s legal. It’s just the culture of Black people. Many are religious and think [taking the drug] is wrong.”\r\n“Those [misconceptions] are holdovers from our having been miseducated from the outset,” Chapman says. “Whites have done a tremendous job educating their community that this is a medical problem, a disease. In the African American community, drug addiction has always been and continues to be seen as a moral problem, and incarceration was the treatment.”\r\nHope for Change\r\nIn the November 2021 issue of Neuropsychopharmacology, Volkow argued that it is long past time for a new approach to drug addiction that would address these misconceptions within the most affected populations and biases among providers. “We have known for decades that addiction is a medical condition—a treatable brain disorder—not a character flaw or a form of social deviance,” she wrote.\r\nVolkow argues that treatment reform should start with prison and the criminal justice system. Even though there is no difference along racial lines in who uses illegal drugs, Black people nonetheless were arrested for drug offenses at five times the rate of white people in 2016. The racial disproportionality in incarcerated drug offenders does not reflect higher rates of drug law violations, only higher rates of arrest among racial and ethnic minorities. Currently the number of arrests for heroin (which more Black people use) exceeds the arrests for diverted prescription opioids (which more white people use), even though the latter is more prevalent.\r\nGooch (right) sits in the kitchen of My Father's House, a recovery facility he founded in Nashville, alongside Charles Gordon, a resident. Gooch says the health-care system discriminates against the Black population, and Black people with addiction problems have difficulty getting treatment from private doctors and hospitals. Credit:\xa0Gioncarlo Valentine\r\nThese unequal arrests and incarcerations add to the racial inequalities in drug treatment and survival rates. An estimated two thirds of people in U.S. correctional settings have a diagnosable substance use disorder, and approximately 95 percent will relapse after their release. In the two weeks postrelease, the risk of overdose increases more than 100-fold, and the chances of death increase 12-fold.\r\nParadoxically, that makes prisons and jails—institutions with the most obvious and overt racial disparities—the places with the greatest potential to bring about effective change. Volkow points to a recent NIH study as proof that starting substance disorder treatment during incarceration lowers the risk of probation violations and reincarcerations and improves the chances of recovery. But only one in 13 prisoners with substance use problems receives treatment, according to a Pew data analysis.\r\nSome local programs have started to tackle some of these issues. In Pittsburgh, the Allegheny Health Network’s RIvER (Rethinking Incarceration and Empowering Recovery) Clinic opened in May 2021. Its goal is to reduce recidivism among people with addictions by providing care for the formerly incarcerated immediately on their release from jail, regardless of their ability to pay. Since opening, the clinic’s caregivers have engaged with hundreds of people.\r\nNew York City recently became the first municipality in the country to sanction overdose prevention centers where people with substance use disorder can use drugs under medical supervision. Two sites, one in East Harlem and the other in Washington Heights, opened in December 2021. They have had more than 10,000 visits and prevented nearly 200 overdoses by administering the medication naloxone.\r\nThere are other signs of change, too. California signed a law that requires every treatment provider in the state to provide a “client bill of rights” to notify patients of all aspects of recommended treatment, including no treatment at all, treatment risks and expected results. And federal authorities loosened methadone regulations during the pandemic. Instead of daily in-person visits, more patients were allowed to use telehealth consultations and take doses home. Senators Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Rand Paul of Kentucky have introduced a bill that would make that change permanent. Among other programs and initiatives across the country, these are an indication that drug treatment policy may be headed in a more equitable, evidence-based direction."": ""{'PERSON': ['Thomas Gooch', 'Nora D.

"{'Today is April 20th, otherwise known as 4/20 day or ""Weed Day,"" a day that has become associated with cannabis use across the world. But it also provides an opportunity to shed light on interesting recent research surrounding medical cannabis, some of which indicates that the judicious use of medical cannabis could help reduce the misuse of prescription opioids.\r\nUnderstanding prescription opioid misuse\r\nPrescription opioids are a class of painkillers often prescribed by physicians for people experiencing chronic pain. Such pain can derive from a variety of sources, including accidents, injuries, or military service, as well as from the wear and tear of everyday life.\r\nDespite their ability to dull and lessen pain, prescription opioids have many side effects; specifically, they can be addictive. This can lead to opioid misuse by unwary individuals who started taking opioids on a doctors advice in a sincere effort to control pain. One survey indicates that over 10 million Americans misuse prescription opioids. Such misuse can be very dangerous. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that opioids were implicated in around 450,000 deaths in the U.S. from 1999 to 2018, and around 35,000 Americans died from overdoses related to the misuse of prescription opioids in 2019 alone. Moreover, the misuse of prescription opioids can lead to severe impairments in areas such as employment, education, and relationships.\r\nImportantly, surveys indicate higher rates of prescription opioid misuse in men than women; men account for around 70 percent of opioid overdose deaths. Some research suggests that men are disproportionately driven to prescription opioid misuse to control pain incurred in dangerous workplaces such as manufacturing, transportation, the military, or law enforcement fields in which men comprise the vast majority of the workforce.\r\nSuch men may be prescribed opioids by physicians and become slowly addicted over time. This can lead them to seek greater dosages from their doctors or to try obtaining prescription opioids on the black market, contributing to more severe addiction and a downward spiral resulting in the aforementioned impairments and overdoses.\r\nCan medical cannabis help?\r\nA growing corpus of research indicates that certain strains of medical cannabis (particularly strains rich in cannabidiol) have powerful pain-killing properties and can be a beneficial agent in chronic pain management. Indeed, some emerging research suggests that medical cannabis can provide a much-needed alternative to prescription opioids and may even mitigate some aspects of the opioid crisis. \r\nFor example, one seminal research study showed that U.S. states with medical cannabis laws had significantly lower rates of opioid overdose deaths compared to U.S. states without such laws, implying that pain sufferers often choose medical cannabis over opioids when such a choice is available.\r\nThis is consistent with my own research on Canadian military veterans living with chronic pain. Many reported that they were originally prescribed opioids for pain relief but that the side effects became intolerable. Given that cannabis is legal in Canada, they decided to use medical cannabis instead, which brought many benefits. This is illustrated in the veterans own words in the short but poignant video below:\r\nThe way forward\r\nA solid body of research indicates that the misuse of prescription opioids remains a massive health and social issue in the U.S. Meanwhile, a related body of research shows that medical cannabis can be an effective pain killer and is a preferred agent for many people living with chronic pain.\r\nHowever, the medical establishment has been slow to integrate such knowledge into everyday practice, perhaps due to (i) lack of training in medical cannabis; (ii) enduring stigmas associated with cannabis use and cannabis users; and (iii) concerns about prescribing a substance of ambiguous legal status. All this implies a need for concerted efforts to destigmatize cannabis use and raise awareness about emerging medical research on the topic, with such efforts targeted at medical practitioners and other influential stakeholders (e.g., teachers and employers), as well as the general public.\r\nThis could help create a climate in which medical cannabis becomes an accepted and legitimate option for people suffering from chronic pain, providing an alternative to opioid prescriptions. This, in turn, may help mitigate some aspects of the opioid crisis.\r\nLets weed out the cannabis myths now.': ""{{'PERSON': ['None'], 'DATE': ['April 20th', '1999 to 2018', '2019'], 'LOC': ['the U.S.', 'Canada'], 'ORG': ['Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'CDC'], 'PROGRAMS': ['None'], 'IMPACT': ['the misuse of prescription opioids can lead to severe impairments in areas such as employment, education, and relationships', 'certain strains of medical cannabis (particularly strains rich in cannabidiol) have powerful pain-killing properties and can be a beneficial agent in chronic pain management', 'cannabis can provide a much-needed alternative to prescription opioids and may even mitigate some aspects of the opioid crisis', 'the misuse of prescription opioids remains a massive health and social issue in the U.S.', 'medical cannabis can be an effective pain killer and is a preferred agent for many people living with chronic pain']}}""}"
"{""Drug overdoses have claimed more than one million lives in the U.S. since 1999, most tied to illicit opioids such as heroin and the nonmedical use of fentanyl. Although people from all walks of life die each day from overdoses, poverty stands out as a driver of this staggering toll. The risk of dying from an overdose is 36 percent higher among people living at or below the poverty line, compared with people living at five times that line, a typical middle class income.\r\nThat’s why expansion of Medicaid, the state and federal health insurance program for low-income individuals, has been hailed as an essential policy to prevent this disproportionate suffering. Implemented in 40 states, Medicaid expansion is a pillar of the Affordable Care Act that extends its coverage to all adults living at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty line (equivalent to a yearly income of $20,120 for an individual). Health insurance can help tackle the overdose crisis because it allows people in need to afford substance use disorder treatment, and treatment is a highly effective way to reduce overdoses.\r\nSo far, however, Medicaid expansion has not fully realized its lifesaving potential for helping to end the overdose epidemic. One reason why is that it takes more than insurance alone to stave off overdoses.\r\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\r\nIn fact, our recent analysis of all overdose deaths in the U.S. from 2008 to 2018 found that Medicaid expansion did not prevent fatal overdoses among people facing poverty; the opioid overdose mortality rate was the same—about 14.5 deaths per 100,000 residents—in states that expanded Medicaid and in states that did not.\r\nThis was not the result we expected.\r\nSo, we dug deeper by analyzing nationwide data gathered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on people who inject drugs. We looked at 19,946 people who subsisted below 138 percent of the poverty line (Medicaid expansion’s eligibility threshold). Some of the states we analyzed had expanded Medicaid, while others had not, allowing us to compare individuals who injected drugs in states that had and had not expanded coverage.\r\nThese comparisons highlight a breakdown in a key pathway that should link Medicaid expansion to improved substance use disorder treatment and thus to reduced overdoses. In a sign of the policy’s success, we found\r\n that insurance coverage rates increased by 19 percentage points among people facing poverty who inject drugs and live in states that had expanded Medicaid, while rates remained unchanged among similar residents of states that had not. Moreover, we also found\r\n people experienced a nine percentage point increase in their probability of getting needed medical care if they lived in expansion states, with no parallel bump in states that did not expand Medicaid.\r\nStrikingly, increased rates of insurance did not,however, lead to increased utilization of substance use disorder treatment; we found\r\n no difference in treatment use across these two groups of people who inject drugs. Other studies have reached similar conclusions.\r\nSo, why might health insurance not be enough to effectively link people to treatment? First, the U.S. has long suffered a marked shortage of treatment slots, so insured individuals who want treatment may still not be able to get it. For example, residential treatment programs operated at 90 percent capacity in 2022, but about three quarters of the people needing treatment that year did not receive it. We need investments to increase treatment capacity, particularly in low-income and rural areas, which have been historically underresourced.\r\nSecond, even with enhanced capacity, Medicaid expansion can only substantially impact overdoses among individuals facing poverty if treatment providers accept its insurance. Unfortunately, in 2020 only 71 percent of treatment facilities nationwide accepted Medicaid. Residents of expansion states do not fare better; a previous study by one of us found\r\n that Medicaid expansion did not result in greater increases in treatment programs accepting Medicaid in expansion states versus states that had not expanded. Low reimbursement rates are a longstanding barrier to provider acceptance of Medicaid. In 2021, the national average Medicaid reimbursement for methadone treatment—a common treatment for opioid use disorder—was nearly half that of Medicare, the federal insurance program for people age 65 and over. This Medicaid–Medicare reimbursement gap was larger than that seen for other services, including primary care. To help ensure that Medicaid expansion truly translates into increased financial access to substance use disorder treatment, policy makers must increase reimbursement for providers.\r\nThese days, people with an opioid use disorder don’t have to rely only on formal programs for treatment; they can also access the pharmaceutical treatment buprenorphine through their primary care physicians and other health care providers. Buprenorphine is a highly effective medication to treat opioid use disorder that also greatly reduces overdose risk. “Secret shopper” studies in which undercover researchers pose as potential patients, however, have found that potential patients struggle to get appointments with physicians who prescribe buprenorphine when they disclose that they are on Medicaid. Increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates, bolstering buprenorphine prescribing among providers within federally qualified health centers (which provide care for low-income individuals) and expanding the role of telemedicine are three pathways toward effectively linking insured people in need to lifesaving treatment.\r\nFinally, even insured individuals who can access treatment may still not be able to use it because of oppressive policies. Methadone, for example, is a highly effective treatment for opioid use disorder that also reduces overdoses. Federal law, however, requires that only specialized clinics can offer it, and that patients must come in person daily for observed medication dosing. These mandates are contemporary practices of the war on drugs, which created barriers to care by punishing even public health programming for drug-related harms. Daily travel to clinics may be impossible for people who have jobs, for people who lack transportation and for those juggling childcare or eldercare. These barriers are common among impoverished people who use drugs, particularly those who are Black, Indigenous or people of color, or those who live in rural communities.\r\nDuring the COVID pandemic, the federal emergency declaration temporarily replaced these punitive policies with a more patient-centered model. Emergency policies permitted some patients to take home up to a 28-day supply of methadone. While this policy has remained in effect even after the federal emergency declaration ended, it is only temporary. The Department of Health and Human Services should make this policy permanent, and support states and treatment programs as they revise policies to support this federal change.\r\nOur study showed expansion was successful at enrolling people facing poverty who use drugs in Medicaid, and that it also helped them access needed medical care. However, our analysis also served as a compelling reminder that insurance coverage alone is insufficient to reverse the overdose crisis for this vulnerable population, because it is not adequately connecting those in need to substance use disorder treatment. We must bolster treatment to meet demand, expand program and provider acceptance of Medicaid, and permanently relax oppressive methadone policies before another million lives are lost.\r\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American."": ""{{'PERSON': ['None'], 'DATE': ['1999', '2008 to 2018', '2022', '2020', '2021'], 'LOC': ['U.S.'], 'ORG': ['Medicaid', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Medicare', 'Department of Health and Human Services', 'Scientific American'], 'PROGRAMS': ['Medicaid expansion', 'Affordable Care Act', 'residential treatment programs', 'buprenorphine treatment'], 'IMPACT': ['claimed more than one million lives', 'risk of dying from an overdose is 36 percent higher among people living at or below the poverty line', 'Medicaid expansion has not fully realized its lifesaving potential', 'insurance coverage rates increased by 19 percentage points', 'nine percentage point increase in their probability of getting needed medical care', 'no difference in treatment use']}}""}"
"{'A woman with substance use disorder pauses under the bridge where she lives in the Kensington section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on July 21, 2017. Substance use disorder and homelessness are risk factors for syphilis. | Spencer Platt/Getty Images\r\n\n \n\n The trend is likely a symptom of failed drug, education, and health policy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a big chunk of the past two decades, sexual health experts generally thought of syphilis as a disease of greatest concern to gay men and their sexual networks. In 2014, more than 90 percent of US cases were diagnosed in men, the vast majority of whom had sex with other men. \nBut in 2015, that began to change: Syphilis began ticking upward in heterosexual adults, too — especially among women. By 2021, women accounted for about a quarter of new syphilis cases; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released data detailing the dramatic rise. \nSyphilis causes skin rashes in its early stages and if untreated, in its later stages, can lead to complications ranging from neurologic problems to cardiovascular disease to death (in around 10 percent of cases). \nBetween 2017 and 2021, infection rates in women rose more than threefold, from two per 100,000 people to seven per 100,000 — a much larger increase than the rise among men, and larger still than the uptick in other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), like chlamydia and gonorrhea. (In absolute numbers, the majority of syphilis infections continue to occur among men who have sex with men, and their infection rates are rising, too. But that increase has been sluggish compared with the meteoric increase among women.) \nSyphilis is particularly concerning when it affects women of childbearing age because of the catastrophic effects it can have on pregnancy. Infections in pregnant people can lead to congenital infections in their newborns, placing them at high risk for stillbirth or severe disability. Indeed, congenital syphilis rates have risen precipitously alongside rates in adult women over the past five years. \nThe reasons for syphilis’s rising rates in women are complex. An unfortunate fact of biology likely plays a part: People with vaginas are more susceptible to STIs than those with penises. \nBut that anatomical reality, while extremely annoying, isn’t enough to explain why an easily curable STI (with just one dose of antibiotics!) is newly and uncontrollably surging among women. Rising syphilis rates in women — and their babies — signal that multiple societal failsafes have, in fact, failed. This is a big red flag that should provoke us to wonder what’s gone wrong, and to think urgently about fixes. \nHere are three theories for how social changes in the US might be contributing to syphilis’s shifting dynamics.\n1) Homelessness and substance abuse increase syphilis risk more for women — and those at highest risk are getting less of the care they need. \nAmong both heterosexual men and women, some of the biggest socioeconomic risk factors for syphilis include drug use — especially opioid, methamphetamine, and heroin use — poverty, homelessness, and transactional sex. Several of these factors have been on the rise in recent years, and they often travel together. \nAlthough these trends affect all genders, it’s among women where they most strongly translate into syphilis risk. Among youth, homelessness raised the risk of syphilis and other STIs far more in girls than in boys. And among people with substance use disorders, women in one study were nearly twice as likely to have transactional sex as men. That led to big negative consequences that fell largely to women: In the same study, people who had transactional sex were three times as likely to have syphilis as those who didn’t.\nMeanwhile, the safety-net sexual health services that are supposed to provide preventive care, testing, and treatment for uninsured Americans, including those at highest risk of syphilis, have dwindled. Since 2004, funding for STI prevention has fallen 41 percent, and many counties don’t have a safety-net sexual health clinic at all. \nThat means many women with the highest vulnerability and the lowest resources — and the men who are most likely to be their sources of infection — are facing bigger barriers than ever to getting tested and treated for syphilis. This is perhaps especially true in rural America. There, the disproportionate impact of the opioid epidemic raises the infection risk for a higher proportion of women — and the disproportionate closure of health facilities more broadly reduces their access to care.\nThe declines in sexual health care have been going on for decades: Nearly 18,000 women got STI testing and treatment at publicly funded clinics in 2018 — about half as many as in 2010. Simultaneously, more people are getting STI care in emergency rooms, where providers often altogether skip testing for syphilis, Irene Stafford, an OB-GYN and syphilis researcher at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, told me in an interview last fall. \nIn these settings, providers more often test patients for chlamydia and gonorrhea than for syphilis, she said, as they are more common.\nOnly about a third of women Stafford sees for syphilis infection complete their treatment, she said, largely because of a mix of socioeconomic challenges and despair. “We have patients who are already mistrusting the government, mistrusting health care, can’t get insured, the health clinics are closed, they’re being trafficked,” she said. \nSyphilis’s persistence and growth among women who are already so marginalized shows how poorly equipped the US health care system is for finding and treating disease in the most vulnerable Americans.\n2) It’s getting harder to access prenatal care, a key catch-and-treat point for syphilis.\nRising syphilis rates in women may also be linked to another burgeoning crisis: declining access to maternal health care.\nMost states require some form of syphilis testing during pregnancy. For that reason, prenatal care is an important tool for catching and treating women’s syphilis infections — and a critical opportunity for preventing these infections from leading to devastating effects in newborns. \nBut prenatal care is becoming increasingly hard to find. Rural hospitals with birth centers —which usually also offer prenatal care — have been closing at an astonishing rate, and obstetricians have been leaving rural communities for urban centers.\nAccording to the March of Dimes, nearly 7 million women of childbearing age have low or no access to maternity care, and the trend disproportionately affects rural parts of the South and the Plains states. \nThe lack of access is concerning considering that in 2021, one-fifth of women diagnosed with syphilis were pregnant. How many more cases might be caught if prenatal care access was closer to women in need? \nBut it’s not just geographic distance that forms a barrier to accessing prenatal care. In 2020, about 11 percent of American women were uninsured — and women without health care coverage are less likely to seek prenatal care. \nAdditionally, while pregnant women who use drugs are at higher risk for getting infected with syphilis, they face state policies that harshly punish substance use during pregnancy. \n“Sometimes people are afraid to seek prenatal care because of the consequences,” said Robert McDonald, a medical epidemiologist who works on syphilis prevention efforts at the CDC, in an interview last fall. \nTwenty-four states have laws on the books that consider drug use while pregnant to be child abuse. Several states go even further, allowing women to be jailed or involuntarily committed to rehabilitation if they are found to be using drugs during pregnancy.\nThe result is that women at highest risk for having syphilis — those with substance use disorders — often avoid the very system that’s intended to protect themselves and their pregnancies.\n3) School sex education is failing to give young women practical STI-prevention tools.\nIn an ideal world, people would learn how to keep themselves from catching syphilis before the opportunity to do so came up. But in many American classrooms, students are getting sex education that simply doesn’t prepare them to avoid STIs.\nSex education in the US is quite the patchwork when it comes to scientific accuracy: Only 17 states require sex ed content to be medically accurate. Meanwhile, 19 states require programs to teach that sex should only happen within marriages, and 29 states require programs to emphasize sexual abstinence.\nPrograms grounded in religious dogma rather than reality leave young people with more questions than answers about their bodies and about their own sexual health, and make many feel like they’ve done something wrong by being sexually active, or even having sexual thoughts. And their effects are particularly detrimental to young women. \nSo-called “abstinence-only until marriage” (AOUM) programs reinforce gender stereotypes about passive women and aggressive men. Studies have shown that women who buy into these gender roles are less likely to use condoms, making them more vulnerable to STIs, including syphilis. Studies also showed students who made virginity pledges had higher STI and non-marital pregnancy rates, and were less likely to use condoms and to be tested for STIs. \nStigmatizing sexual activity among teens — whether intentionally or not — also reduces the likelihood that a young woman with an STI will seek care for it. Because syphilis can hang around in the body for years before causing severe symptoms, that means the negative effects of low-quality sex ed in high school can lead to health problems that manifest well into adulthood.\nIt’s not like there’s no better way: Inclusive, medically accurate sex ed that includes education on healthy relationships and communication has been proven not only to reduce STI rates, but also to lead to lower rates of unwanted pregnancy. \nEffective sex ed goes well beyond teaching students the basics of sexual biology, said Michelle Slaybaugh, a former school sex educator who directs social impact and communications at SIECUS, a nonprofit comprehensive sex ed advocacy organization, in an interview last summer.\n“Students have to understand what it means to be turned on, what does pleasure feel like,” said Slaybaugh. “Then they can understand, when they are in those moments, how they need to move forward to safely protect themselves and their partners.”\nIt’s wildly unlikely that such a nuanced brand of sex ed will hit all the US classrooms where it’s needed anytime soon. \nPunitive, stigmatizing policies make the situation worse — not better \nWhat so many of the above trends have in common is that they result from policies attempting to incentivize desired behaviors by punishing or stigmatizing undesired ones. \nIt’s clear in the case of opioids, where the strict punishments for abuse keep people from seeking care. \nSimilarly, comprehensive sex education could actually reduce young women’s risk for syphilis. But a preference for programs that systematically stigmatize young people’s sexuality means many are deprived of the tools they need to negotiate safe sex. \nThese policies reduce women’s autonomy, their trust in health care providers, and their ability to get their needs met. Syphilis is just one signal of these punitive approaches’ harms — but it’s one we should heed.': ""{'PERSON': ['Spencer Platt', 'Vivian Peng', 'Robert McDonald', 'Michelle Slaybaugh'], 'DATE': ['July 21, 2017', '2014', '2015', '2021', 'Since 2004', '2018', '2010', '2020'], 'LOC': ['Kensington', 'Philadelphia', 'Pennsylvania', 'US', 'America', 'University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston', 'South', 'Plains states'], 'ORG': ['Getty Images', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'March of Dimes', 'CDC', 'SIECUS'], 'PROGRAMS': ['resource hub', 'safety-net sexual health services', 'STI prevention', 'syphilis prevention efforts', 'sex education'], 'IMPACT': ['Syphilis has risen in women of childbearing age leading to complications ranging from neurologic problems to cardiovascular disease to death, congenital infections in newborns leading to high risks for stillbirth or severe disability.

"{'Cammie Wolf Rice launched the Christopher Wolf Crusade (CWC) in 2018 in memory of her son, Christopher, who died from an opioid overdose. He became addicted due to the overprescribing of opioids for his pain after multiple surgeries as a teenager and young adult. In Cammie\'s experiences with her son\'s hospitalizations, not one health-care provider gave her family information about the dangers of pain medication. Her experience was the catalyst to conceptualize the role of Life Care Specialist and the need to add this new level of health-care provider to hospital systems nationwide. \r\nOpioid use and misuse are public-health emergencies, and innovations are needed to address the overprescribing epidemic. Neuman (2019) reports that the U.S. and Canada are two countries where opioid overprescribing after surgery appears to be common. Ladha (2019) finds that excessive postoperative opioid prescribing has been associated with increased risks of drug diversion, new long-term opioid use, and the development of opioid use disorder. \r\nIn the United States, thousands of families are grieving from losing a family member due to opioids. The Centers for Disease Control (2022) report that overdose deaths involving opioids increased from an estimated 70,029 in 2020 to 80,816 in 2021. Cammie\'s journey has been torturous and ladened with grief, and she is not alone. We at the Trauma Resource Institute, along with Emory University, Grady Hospital, Usher\'s New Look, the Cambodian Children\'s Fund, and Mercer University School of Medicine, have partnered with her and the CWC to try to introduce innovation to the public health issue of opioid addiction.\r\nDamiescu\'s (2021) review evaluated the risk factors associated with opioid overdoses. It investigated the rates of chronic opioid misuse, particularly in the context of chronic pain and post-surgery treatments, as those typically represent the entrance of opioids into people\'s lives. Damiescu (2021) stated that opioid abuse and misuse have led to an epidemic that is spreading worldwide and suggests that fighting it requires a structured public health approach. \r\nIn the immense sea of needed interventions to address the public health emergency of the opioid crisis, the Christopher Wolf Crusade launched, in conjunction with Emory University and Grady Hospital in Atlanta, the Life Care Specialist Program. Dr. Mara Schenker, Dr. Nicholas Giordano, and their colleagues have launched research titled, ""The effect of a Life Care Specialist on painmanagement and opioid-related outcomes among patients with orthopedic trauma."" Their preliminary results are promising.\r\nThe Life Care Specialist Program\'s goal is to establish Life Care Specialists (LCS) within hospitals nationwide. The LCS is part of an interdisciplinary treatment team collaborating on assessment and treatment. The specialist\'s primary focus is to introduce an integrated behavior-specific intervention during inpatient hospitalization to decrease opioid utilization and improve pain management post-hospitalization.\r\nThe Life Care Specialist Training follows a multi-modal approach. The training educates about the nature of opioids and the impact of opioid use, misuse, and addiction on individuals and families. LCS training includes the development of skills and information to optimize the LCSs\' interactions with patients. The specialist learns to use nonpharmacological interventions that promote well-being and that can be integrated into the patient\'s Life Care Plana personalized comprehensive pain-management plan created by the patient in collaboration with their LCS. The plan aims to optimize pain management strategies and help the patient learn about the array of nonpharmacological interventions that can be integrated into daily living activities to reduce or eliminate the use of opioid medication. \r\nThe Healing Wheel is the hub of the Life Care Specialist Program. The components of the Healing Wheel are delivered by Life Care Specialists trained to be the bridge between the hospital and home, providing much-needed information about how to taper off opioid medication prescribed after orthopedic surgery. The Healing Wheel includes a Personalized Pain Management Plan, Mental Health Wellness Skills, Relaxation Exercises, Empathic Listening, Care Coordination and Referral, Continued Care after Hospitalization, Caregiver Support, Sleep Coaching, Music Therapy, and Pain Medication Education.\r\nCammie Wolf Rice\'s new book, The Flight: My Opioid Journey, describes her path and the purpose and meaning that came out of her grief over her son\'s avoidable and tragic death. Cammie poignantly describes the events that inspired her to create the CWC and her mission to create prevention strategies to end opioid dependence. The book can be helpful for therapists and clients addressing the opioid crisis personally and systemically.\r\nCammie has a message for families struggling with opioids: ""Your loved one is suffering and don\'t give up on them. Creating a support team around you is crucial, so you have someone to reach out to when you need help."" Cammie encourages all parents to be health advocates for their children: ""We must protect our kids and ask questions if your child must have surgery. Do you have a non-narcotic for my child? How long does my child need to be on this? We assume that just because something is prescribed, it\'s safe.""\r\nTo learn more, visit CammieWolfRice.com.': ""{'PERSON': ['Cammie Wolf Rice', 'Christopher', 'Neuman', 'Ladha', 'Damiescu', 'Dr. Mara Schenker', 'Dr. Nicholas Giordano'], 'DATE': ['2018', '2019', '2020', '2021'], 'LOC': ['United States', 'Canada', 'Atlanta'], 'ORG': ['Christopher Wolf Crusade (CWC)', 'Trauma Resource Institute', 'Emory University', 'Grady Hospital', 'Usher's New Look', 'Cambodian Children's Fund', 'Mercer University School of Medicine', 'Centers for Disease Control'], 'PROGRAMS': ['Life Care Specialist Program', 'Life Care Specialist Training', 'Healing Wheel'], 'IMPACT': ['Overdose deaths involving opioids increased from an estimated 70,029 in 2020 to 80,816 in 2021', 'The Life Care Specialist Program\\'s goal is to establish Life Care Specialists (LCS) within hospitals nationwide.', 'Decrease opioid utilization and improve pain management post-hospitalization', 'Help the patient learn about the array of nonpharmacological interventions that can be integrated into daily living activities to reduce or eliminate the use of opioid medication', 'Provide much-needed information about how to taper off opioid medication prescribed after orthopedic surgery']}""}"
"{'Responding to a backlash from pain patients, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released updated guidelines Thursday that offer clinicians more flexibility in the way they prescribe opioids for short- and long-term pain.\r\nThe new recommendations eliminate numerical dose limits and caps on length of treatment for chronic pain patients that had been suggested in the landmark 2016 version of the agency\'s advice, which was aimed at curbing the liberal use of the medication and controlling a rampaging opioid epidemic. Those guidelines cautioned doctors that commencing opioid therapy was a momentous decision for patients.\r\nParts of that nonbinding document were widely misinterpreted, resulting in unintended harm to patients who were benefiting from use of opioids without much risk of addiction. Patients reported they were rapidly tapered off medication by doctors or saw their medication abruptly discontinued, the CDC acknowledged in the new document. Some insurers and pharmacies set rigid limits on duration of prescriptions or dropped patients altogether.\r\nThe new 100 pages of guidance - which remain only recommendations for doctors, nurse practitioners and others authorized to prescribe opioids - emphasize returning the focus to the caregiver and patient deciding on the best course of treatment.\r\n""This guideline is really intended to be a mechanism to help patients and providers work together,"" Christopher Jones, acting director of CDC\'s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, said in an interview Thursday. ""We have leaned in on more principles, rather than thresholds.""\r\nThough a record 107,000 Americans died of opioid overdoses in 2021, much about the epidemic has changed since 2016. The number of prescriptions for opioids, which peaked at more than 255 million in 2012, was still at nearly 215 million when the CDC released the first set of guidelines.\r\nBy 2020, that number had declined to 142 million, a reflection of efforts to reduce opioid use in favor of other approaches to pain and a recognition that many addictions begin with prescribed medication.\r\nThe ongoing overdose epidemic is now caused mainly by illegal fentanyl, which is laced into a wide variety of street drugs and consumed, sometimes unknowingly, by users.\r\nYet chronic pain - defined as pain that lasts more than three months - remains one of the most common conditions suffered by U.S. patients. In 2019, 1 in 5 adults reported chronic pain, and 1 in 14 said it limited life or work activities, according to the CDC. Chronic pain is blamed for $560 billion to $635 billion in direct medical costs, lost productivity and disability each year, and contributes to 9 percent of suicides, the agency said.\r\nThe new recommendations were proposed in February and sent out for comment from the public and experts before being adopted by the CDC. They took into account research on opioids conducted since 2016. Like the previous version, they are not intended for treatment of pain from sickle cell disease and cancer, or palliative and end-of-life care, which demand special consideration from caregivers.\r\nAt least one group had hoped the guidelines would retain numerical caps in one of the boldfaced recommendations for prescribers. In a March 25 letter, Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, one of the fiercest critics of liberal opioid use, advised highlighting a cap of 50 morphine milligram equivalents as the daily line at which prescribers are likely to face ""diminishing returns."" That number is noted deeper in the guidance.\r\nLike the previous guidelines, the new version recommends that caregivers try non-opioid approaches to pain control before initiating the medication. They also note disparity in the care of people of color, some of whom are less likely to be referred to a pain specialist or receive postpartum pain assessments than White people. Black people also receive lower doses of pain medication than their White peers.\r\nThe new recommendations also include advice on ways doctors and patients can discuss tapering off drugs; a warning that clinicians should ""weigh benefits and risks and exercise care when changing opioid dosage""; and a notice that they should ""regularly reevaluate benefits and risks of continued opioid therapy with patients.""\r\nIn no way is there an intent that they be applied as a one-size-fits-all, Jones said. These are just guideposts.': '{\'PERSON\': [\'Christopher Jones\'], \'DATE\': [\'Thursday\', \'2016\', \'2021\', \'2012\', \'2020\', \'2019\', \'February\', \'March 25\'], \'LOC\': [\'U.S.\'], \'ORG\': [\'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\', ""CDC\'s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control"", \'Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing\'], \'PROGRAMS\': [\'new resource hub\', \'updated guidelines\', \'new guidelines\'], \'IMPACT\': [\'offer clinicians more flexibility in the way they prescribe opioids\', \'controlling a rampaging opioid epidemic\', \'reduce opioid use in favor of other approaches to pain\', \'ongoing overdose epidemic\', \'guidelines careful approach to pain control\']}'}"
"{'The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday issued new guidance for doctors who treat pain patients that reverses a 2016 version used to sharply curtail opioid prescriptions, ultimately leading to devastating results for some pain patients.\r\nThe new guidance avoids strict figures on dosage and length of opioid prescriptions, recommends how and when to prescribe opioids, and describes harms and benefits. But the CDC emphasized the recommendations are voluntary and flexible and should not be used to support a one-size-fits-all policy.\r\nThe original version was meant for primary care doctors who treat chronic pain patients but ended up being used by states, licensing boards, insurers, pharmacies and others to force millions of Americans to rapidly reduce or discontinue prescription opioids.\r\nPain patient advocates said the update improves the original version that led to abrupt changes for 8 to 13 million Americans who take opioids to manage pain. But they said prescribers, insurers and others must adopt more nuanced policies to avoid harms such as addiction, suicide and diminishing quality of life.\r\n""The CDC is sending a pretty strong message to all payers, states and health systems that they need to reverse course, that they misapplied the (2016) guideline and they need to change because they\'re causing harm,"" said Kate Nicholson, executive director and founder of the National Pain Advocacy Center.\r\nMORE: Pain patients left in anguish by doctors \'terrified\' of opioid addiction\r\nWhat are the new recommendations?\r\nThe guidance addresses whether to prescribe opioids for pain, determining dosages, length of initial fills, and how and when to follow up with patients.\r\nThe CDC guidance says doctors should:\r\n<ul><li>Discuss alternative therapies and prescribe the lowest dosage for patients who have not taken opioids before.\r\n</li><li>Recommend pain pills for chronic pain patients only if the benefits and ability to do daily tasks outweigh known risks, which can include addiction, overdose and death.\r\n</li><li>Discuss risks and benefits, and consider how opioid prescriptions will be discontinued.\r\n</li><li>Rely on other therapies and try to gradually lower dosages or discontinue opioids for patients already on higher dosages.\r\n</li></ul>Unless there\'s a life-threatening issue such as signs of overdose, doctors should not abruptly discontinue or rapidly reduce opioid dosages, the guidance says.\r\n""Patients with pain should receive compassionate, safe and effective pain care,"" said Christopher Jones, acting director of CDCs National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. ""We want clinicians and patients to have the information they need to weigh the benefits of different approaches to pain care, with the goal of helping people reduce their pain and improve their quality of life.\r\nHow is it different from the old recommendations?\r\nUnder the old recommendation, chronic pain patients complained of being cut off from pills they had taken for months or even years. Some in the middle of cancer treatments, sickle cell disease or recovering from operations could not get pain medications even though the policy did not focus on these individuals.\r\nThe updated guidance has recommendations for those with short-term pain of less than one month, lingering pain of one to three months, and chronic pain of more than three months.\r\nThe original guidance stressed that doctors should be careful to avoid daily opioid doses that exceed 90 morphine milligram equivalents. The new version recommends doctors be cautious but does not forbid prescribing daily doses of more than 50 morphine milligram equivalents. If doctors do prescribe that much, the guidance recommends doctors offer overdose education and the overdose-reversal drug naloxone.\r\nHow will the CDC monitor the guidance?\r\nWhile the guidance is voluntary, the CDC will evaluate and monitor how doctors and patients adjust to the new recommendations.\r\nThe CDC plans to educate doctors and others if the agency sees evidence people are misinterpreting the guidance or using it as ""justification for taking some rigid action that applies to all patients,"" Jones said in a call with reporters.\r\n\'Wake-up call\': Allergy medications may play a deadly role in the opioid epidemic\r\nWhat are the lingering effects from the original guidance?\r\nStudies show more than half of primary care doctors won\'t see a patient who takes opioids to manage pain, Nicholson said.\r\nAbruptly tapering or discontinuing opioids increases pain patients\' risk of addiction and suicide. Jones said abrupt tapering ""creates a very real risk"" for patients, including mental health, thoughts of suicide or seeking illicit opioids to stave off withdrawal.\r\nAfter the 2016 guidance, more than half of states passed laws that limited initial opioid prescriptions for acute pain to seven days or less. Many states limited pain pill fills for Medicaid enrollees, and private insurers and pharmacies also curtailed opioid prescriptions. Some states enacted strict limits on doses, prompting doctors to aggressively taper patients who had been on opioids for years, and medical boards sanctioned doctors who ran afoul of the tighter requirements.\r\nAfter the original guidelines, a non-peer-reviewed survey of more than 3,000 patients found 84% reported more pain and worse quality of life, and 42% said they had considered suicide, according to the CDC.\r\nMORE: States detail $26B settlement to resolve opioid lawsuits with Johnson &amp; Johnson, drug distributors\r\nDo disparities exist among pain patients?\r\nBlack patients have lower overdose rates from prescription pain pills than white patients, Latinos and Native Americans, but one study cited by the CDC showed Black patients were more likely than whites to have early refills restricted.

"{'By John C Messinger, Anand Chukka, and J. Wesley Boyd\r\nIsolation and anxiety caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have fueled an already out-of-control overdose crisis. In 2020 alone, more than 100,000 individuals died from an overdose. With overdose rates reaching such unfathomable heights, dramatic steps are needed to stem the loss of life.\r\nThe Department of Health and Human Services took one important step by eliminating a special training requirementobtaining a so-called ""X waiver""for clinicians to be able to prescribe buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist used to treat opioid use disorder. This drug helps people avoid opioids by reducing opioid cravings and withdrawal symptoms.\r\nWhile the waiver elimination aims to expand access to this lifesaving medication, some critics say that deregulation would lead to increased ""diversion"" of buprenorphine, meaning its use for some purpose other than its intended use, or by someone other than the person it was prescribed for.\r\nAlthough it is difficult to get high on buprenorphine, some people do use it as a recreational drug. Rates of overdose, however, are low; for example, buprenorphine accounted for less than 5 percent of overdose deaths in Tennessee in 2020.\r\nPeople who use buprenorphine prescribed for someone else generally use it to help treat their opioid use disorder. One study from Massachusetts found that greater than 90 percent of individuals who had used diverted buprenorphine did so to prevent opioid craving or withdrawal, while less than 10 percent used it to get high.\r\nAlthough medication diversion of any sort is generally considered harmful, as we argue in a commentary published on March 22 in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine, the potential of diverted buprenorphine to save lives outweighs any hypothetical harms of its use.\r\nThe effects of buprenorphine are stunning. One meta-analysis found that people taking buprenorphine are 64 percent less likely to die from overdose than those not taking medications for opioid use disorder. For reference, statins, regarded as one of the most beneficial and universally supported medications used in the treatment of heart disease, reduce the risk of major coronary events by roughly 30 percent.\r\nThough we recognize the potential dangers of buying and selling drugs ""on the street,"" we must point out that the lifesaving effect of buprenorphine remains even when it is being diverted. A recent study found that the use of nonprescribed buprenorphine, even when used less than once a week, reduced the risk of unintentional overdose. Buprenorphine in and of itself, even when separated from structured medical care, is a powerful tool to reduce the risk of overdose.\r\nAnother benefit of diverted buprenorphine is that it offers a stepping stone for people who are not being treated for addiction to seek medical care. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that only 10 percent of individuals who need substance use treatment received care from an addiction specialist. While some of the deficit is due to a lack of available clinicians or treatment centers, there are many people who intentionally avoid seeking medical care due to a long history of mistreatment, stigma, and marginalization of people who use drugs.\r\nAnecdotally, a large proportion of those seeking medications for treating opioid use disorder has tried buprenorphine theyve been given by a friend or bought on the street. For those who have reasons to distrust the medical system, diverted buprenorphine from a close contact offers an important gateway into medically supervised treatment. Indeed, studies have demonstrated an association between the use of nonprescribed buprenorphine and that individuals willingness to participate in treatment with a medical provider.\r\nOver the last few years, opioids sold on the street have become dramatically more potent. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 70 percent of overdose deaths since the COVID-19 pandemic started have been caused by synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. Fentanyl has dominated the opiate market and is now found in many other recreational drugs sold on the street, potentially contributing to the increasing rates of overdose nationwide.\r\nWhile buprenorphine carries its own risk of overdose, it is minuscule compared to that posed by fentanyl. A recent study of 534 opioid-involved deaths found that only one death was solely attributable to buprenorphine. The presence of diverted buprenorphine as an alternative to fentanyl offers a safer option for people who use drugs.\r\nThe availability of buprenorphine is particularly important as medications for opioid use disorder prescribed by a medical provider can be difficult to access. In one study done in New York, people who use heroin, a historically marginalized and underinsured group, have high levels of interest in using buprenorphine but low levels of access to it. And these difficulties in accessing buprenorphine disproportionately affect racially minoritized populations. While buprenorphine access increased between 2004 and 2013 for all New York City zip codes, this increase was greatest in primarily wealthy, white neighborhoods.\r\nThe availability of diverted buprenorphine may help increase access to communities that have historically been excluded from medically-directed buprenorphine. However, it is important to acknowledge that this is not a legitimate long-term solution and that additional work must be done to bridge the gap in care for these populations.\r\nThe overdose crisis shows no signs of abating; the last twelve months have been the deadliest in history, with over 100,000 overdose deaths for the first time. In times of crisis, we need to prioritize saving lives over and above our personal comfort zones or individual morals and values otherwise. With respect to overdose deaths, this means that buprenorphine should be available to everyone who needs it, whether that\'s via prescriptions or otherwise. Making that happen, we argue, requires easing concerns about the diversion of buprenorphine and decriminalizing its sale.\r\nThis is more than just a pipe dream: In June of 2021, Vermont and Rhode Island became the first two U.S. states to decriminalize possession of nonprescribed buprenorphine.\r\nBuprenorphine saves lives. It\'s time to promote its use for those with opioid use disorders.\r\nJohn C Messinger is a third-year student at Harvard Medical School in Boston.

"{'US life expectancy increased this past year, from 76.4 to 77.5 years, according to a report published Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, after declining for two years in a row. \r\nIts not exactly a cause for celebration. Americas life expectancy has been lower than that of other wealthy countries for decades, and declined more than other nations during the pandemic. The trends were bad before the pandemic, and awful during it. Now theyre on their way back to being merely bad.\r\nAs a measure of a nations well-being, life expectancy is useful, but its meaning is sometimes misunderstood. Life expectancy isnt about individual people its about the moments theyre born into. The metric doesnt refer to the number of years a baby born today can expect to live. Instead, it reflects how long a baby born today would live if nothing in their environment changed over their lifetime. Its like saying: If every year of this childs life was like the year 2023, how long would they live? \r\nThat means that if a baby is born during a period when lots of people are dying at relatively young ages e.g., during a pandemic or a war their estimated life expectancy would be lower than if they were born during happier times. And obviously, the babys individual life expectancy will change if their environment and conditions change if the pandemic or war ends, for example. \r\nThe point is that life expectancy changes in response to the social, cultural, environmental, and political environments countries create. That makes it a helpful tool for tracking the health of nations populations over time, and for comparing the health of different countries populations.\r\nA closer look at this years figures offers some pointed reminders that the USs life expectancy curve isnt an accident, but a response to choices its elected officials have made.\r\nHere are four takeaways from the report.\r\n1) Covid-19 killed fewer people in 2022 than it did in 2021 but it still killed a lot of people. \r\nThe historic drop in life expectancy that occurred in the first two years of the pandemic was the worst the US had seen since World War II. The CDC estimates 375,000 Americans died due to Covid-19 infection in 2020, and about 460,000 in 2021 an almost incomprehensible loss of human potential. \r\nIn 2022, there were fewer Covid-19 deaths, but still a lot: 244,000. \r\nThis is the main reason for the increase of life expectancy in the CDC report: Covid-19 is killing fewer people.\r\nBut Covid-19 may also help explain why the US is not yet all the way back up to its pre-pandemic life expectancy of 78.8 years.\r\nMost other countries around the world also saw big dips in their life expectancies during the first year of the pandemic. But the USs decrease was bigger than other countries and its rebound has been slower. \r\nThe authors of a study assessing pandemic-era life expectancy changes across a range of countries hypothesized that US mortality due to Covid-19 was higher than that in European countries due to higher rates of underlying conditions like obesity and diabetes. A recent analysis by the Washington Post suggests that stalled progress on preventing and treating chronic illness is responsible for the majority of deaths among Americans in their prime.\r\nWere starting from a lower spot, and we sunk faster than other countries, said Joshua Sharfstein, a physician and epidemiologist who directs the Bloomberg American Health Initiative at Johns Hopkins Universitys public health school. And now were trying to crawl our way out.\r\n2) Racial/ethnic groups that lost the most when Covid was at its most lethal had the most to gain as the virus got weaker. \r\nThe figures in the report suggest certain racial and ethnic groups made particularly big gains in life expectancy. For example, life expectancy went up by 2.3 years for American Indians and Alaska Natives; by 2.2 years for Hispanic Americans; and by 1.6 years for Black Americans. \r\nDoes this mean the US has fixed health disparities?\r\nNo. This reflects that those groups that had the highest rates of pandemic-related deaths had the most to gain when Covid-related mortality went down. Groups had a little bump that was in proportion to the loss that they had, said Sharfstein.\r\nOver the course of the pandemic, American Indians and Alaska Natives died of Covid-19 at more than twice the rate of white Americans, and Black and Hispanic Americans also died at much higher rates. \r\nThe disproportionate increase in life expectancy in these groups just indicates they were further from their baseline during the worst of the pandemic.\r\n3) Infant mortality rose. Its likely due to abortion bans and failing maternal health care. \r\nAnother factor holding down US life expectancy, according to the report, is infant mortality. \r\nIn 2022, rising death rates due to perinatal conditions (that is, fetal deaths later in pregnancy or newborn deaths ) and congenital malformations kept the topline numbers from creeping higher. \r\nThat hadnt been the case in 2021, or in 2020. In fact, in those years, death rates due to these types of conditions actually decreased.\r\nThis is likely a consequence of ending the constitutional right to abortion, said Sharfstein. Theres a very strong relationship between access to abortion and infant mortality and infant mortality went up, he said. (Multiplestudies have linked restrictions to abortion access with higher infant death rates. According to the Society for Family Planning, there were about 32,000 fewer abortions in the six months after the Supreme Court overturned a national right to the procedure in June 2022.)\r\nSome of this is related to changes in how doomed pregnancies are managed in the face of criminalized abortion. When OB-GYNs cannot safely provide a full spectrum of medical care, they cannot provide the abortions that would prevent pregnant people from carrying nonviable pregnancies to term. That means pregnancies that previously would have ended long before labor and delivery are instead progressing to birth and the infants who result from those pregnancies are dying shortly thereafter. \r\nBut its also likely related to the impact of abortion restrictions on the availability of prenatal care and that directly affects both infant and maternal mortality. As I wrote earlier this month, maternal care providers are leaving states with abortion restrictions, and medical trainees are avoiding these states because they know that in states that dont permit abortion, they wont get training in a key part of pregnancy care. \r\nPrenatal care reduces the risk of infant death and may also reduce risks to mothers and a lack of prenatal care increases the risk babies will die. \r\nTheres no question that the reduction in reproductive health care access has implications for population health, said Sharfstein.\r\n4) Our baseline compared to other countries both before and after peak pandemic is low, and we havent taken any steps to address the root causes.\r\nIn 1980, US life expectancy was among the highest in the developed world now, its one of the lowest. There are many possible reasons for this: Compared with other countries, the USs health care system is one of the most difficult to afford and navigate, and invests less in preventive care than in high-tech treatment. The nation wildly underfunds public health, has a high prevalence of processedfoods, and promotes overwork and underrest. And access to guns and opioids has made high rates of deathduetoboth a uniquely American problem.\r\nThe prevalence of many chronichealthconditions along with smoking cigarettes, another important contributor to premature death and Covid-19 mortality can be changed by policy choices.\r\nImproving the public health system, rebalancing the health care system more toward prevention, thinking about the social drivers of health more intensely, addressing major social challenges that sometimes are right in front of our eyes and associated with a lot of death, said Sharfstein all of those things are going to be necessary to improve Americans overall health.\r\nWill you support Voxs explanatory journalism?\r\nMost news outlets make their money through advertising or subscriptions. But when it comes to what were trying to do at Vox, there are a couple of big issues with relying on ads and subscriptions to keep the lights on:\r\nFirst, advertising dollars go up and down with the economy. We often only know a few months out what our advertising revenue will be, which makes it hard to plan ahead.\r\nSecond, were not in the subscriptions business. Vox is here to help everyone understand the complex issues shaping the world not just the people who can afford to pay for a subscription. We believe thats an important part of building a more equal society. And we cant do that if we have a paywall. \r\nSo even though advertising is still our biggest source of revenue, we also seek grants and reader support. (And no matter how our work is funded, we have strict guidelines on editorial independence.)\r\nIf you also believe that everyone deserves access to trusted high-quality information, will you make a gift to Vox today?

"{'Menthol cigarettes and cigars would be banned from sale under two proposed rules released Thursday, marking a long-awaited step in the FDAs efforts to address tobacco-related health disparities.\r\nThe Food and Drug Administration issued new product standards targeting menthol and other flavored tobacco products that can make smoking harder to quit, especially among youth. These products are often disproportionately used by Black Americans and other minority groups. \r\nWe need a care package to help them quit. People dont realize that the addictiveness of nicotine ranks right up there with opioids, FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said Thursday at a hearing.\r\nThe first proposed rule (\r\nRIN 0910-AI60) would prohibit tobacco manufacturers and retailers from making, distributing, and selling cigarettes containing menthol as a flavor. The second (\r\nRIN 0910-AI28) would ban all characterizing flavors, including menthol, in cigars. Both need to be finalized after a public comment period.\r\nThe move is a potential boon for public health if it causes menthol smokers to quit or deters people from taking up cigarettes in the first place. Its also a blow to cigarette makers that are already struggling with declining sales, as well as governments that rely on tax income from cigarettes.\r\nAround 37% of cigarettes sold in 2020 were menthol, up from 34% in 2015, according to data from the Federal Trade Commission. Companies that would be hurt by a menthol ban include \r\nAltria Group Inc., \r\nImperial Brands Plc, which makes Kool cigarettes, and \r\nBritish American Tobacco Plc.\r\nTobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death and disease in the United States. Menthols flavor and sensory effects increase appeal and make menthol cigarettes easier to use, particularly among youth and young adults, the FDA said in the proposed rule for cigarettes.\r\nThe agency said the product standard for cigars would reduce the appeal particularly for young adults and thereby decrease the likelihood of experimentation, development of nicotine dependence, and progression to regular use.\r\nLong-Awaited Plan\r\nIn April 2021, the agency \r\nannounced that it would pursue the menthol bans as part of its efforts to reduce disease and death caused by combusted tobacco product use. Menthol flavoring gives cigarettes a minty taste and soothes the throat, but the FDA has warned that it can also make smoking more addictive and appealing.\r\nThe FDA has previously said that it wouldnt impose penalties on individual consumers who possess or use menthol-containing products, while still ensuring that no new unlawful cigarette or cigar products are added to the market. \r\nAnti-tobacco groups, like the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, \r\napplauded the FDA on its plans, but cigarette makers have pushed back. \r\nAltria has argued that smokers will keep using regular cigarettes or move to black-market products if there arent enough desirable alternatives to menthol available.\r\nWhen finalized, the cigarette menthol ban will be the single most significant action that the FDA has taken on tobacco, Erika Sward, assistant vice president of national advocacy at the American Lung Association, said.\r\nHealth Equity\r\nNearly 85% of all non-Hispanic Black smokers report using menthol cigarettes, compared with just 30% of non-Hispanic White smokers, according to the FDA. The agency has also said that in 2020, the 30-day cigar smoking levels for non-Hispanic Black high school students were twice as high as White students.\r\nFor decades the tobacco industry has deliberately targeted Black communities with marketing for menthol cigarettes, with tragic consequences. The industry also uses these flavored products to lure kids into a deadly addiction, said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.\r\nThese rules will, once and for all, put an end to these predatory and deadly practices, Myers said in a statement.\r\nThe FDA has been reviewing the use of menthol in cigarettes since the passage of the 2009 Tobacco Control Act, which banned characterizing flavors in cigarettes but didnt include menthol. That law helped to fuel a sharp increase in flavored cigar use, especially among youth and racial minority populations, according to the FDA.\r\nFlavored cigars were marketed as a starter product, particularly in black communities, Sward said.\r\nFor far too long, specific populations have been targeted and disproportionately impacted by tobacco use, especially when it comes to characterizing flavors that entice them to start and keep smoking, then-Center for Tobacco Products Director Mitch Zeller, who retired earlier this month, said in \r\na January statement. \r\nMarket Issues\r\nNot everyone however is praising the FDAs move.\r\nTim Andrews, Americans for Tax Reforms director of consumer issues, called the FDAs proposal misguided, noting it will have disastrous impacts on public health and public safety while failing to curb smoking.\r\nIf the FDA were serious about reducing smoking rates, they would accept the science and follow the recommendation of over 100 of the worlds leading medical bodies to embrace reduced risk tobacco alternatives, such as e-cigarettes, which have been proven 95% safer than combustible cigarettes, Andrews said in a statement.\r\nThis proposed rulemaking will inevitably lead to further growth of illicit markets, put members of minority communities in danger, and divert law enforcement resources away from real crime, he added.\r\nThe FDA is currently reviewing vape products that are already on the market, and deciding whether they are appropriate for the protection of public health and can remain on shelves. Its highly-anticipated decision on products made by \r\nJuul Labs Inc. is expected at any time.\r\nA federal menthol ban may cost the U.S. government $6.6 billion in lost excise taxes, which can represent up to 40% of the cigarettes retail price, according to a March report from the \r\nTax Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on tax policy. \r\nThat potential loss is still just a fraction of what the government might save if the menthol ban leads to fewer smokers, however. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \r\nestimates that smoking-related illnesses cost the U.S. more than $300 billion a year, including $5.6 billion alone due to second-hand smoke exposure.\r\nMichael R.

"{'Potentially life-saving medication will be made readily available at hundreds of sites across New Hampshire as part of a public health initiative to curb the opioid crisis, state officials announced Tuesday.\r\nThe plan is to install a NaloxBox in more than 700 public places across all 10 counties in a coordinated effort involving the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services and the states partners in substance misuse prevention, officials said.\r\nThe hard acrylic boxes will contain naloxone, a medication that can block the toxic effects of opioid overdoses. The boxes will be mounted to exterior walls to offer round-the-clock public access, while also working to reduce the stigma associated with opioid overdoses, officials said.\r\nThe publicly available naloxone will add to the resources already provided by groups like the New Hampshire Harm Reduction Coalition, which operates an overdose prevention van and runs weekly programs in Concord, Manchester, Rochester, Dover, and Somersworth. The group reported that its participants reversed 1,459 drug overdoses statewide in 2022.\r\nStill, the states Office of Chief Medical Examiner reported 463 confirmed drug overdose deaths in 2022. Most were accidental, and most were caused by opioids.\r\nHealth and Human Services Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Ballard said lives are saved when naloxone is administered at the first sign of an overdose.\r\nDuring a medical emergency, every minute counts, and providing public access to life-saving medication that can reverse the impact of an overdose while it is occurring is a critical step in reducing the number of lives lost to substance use disorder, Ballard said in a statement.\r\nGovernor Chris Sununu, a Republican, said these boxes will be yet another tool in New Hampshires efforts to build a robust treatment and recovery system, while prevention remains the states top goal.\r\nAny business or community entity can request a NaloxBox unit to install in an accessible and highly visible area, officials said. Businesses or organizations can contact state opioid response director Jennifer Sabin at Jennifer.A.Sabin@dhhs.nh.gov.\r\nOthers who would like to access naloxone for individual purposes, including first responders, families, and caregivers, can contact their local Doorway location.\r\nOfficials said they will work with the states 13 regional public health networks, the Harm Reduction Coalition, and Recovery Friendly Workplace locations to distribute the units. Those that receive a NaloxBox unit will be responsible for monitoring it and requesting refills.\r\nThis wont be the first time a NaloxBox has been installed in New Hampshire. The units have been placed at individual sites in the Granite State and elsewhere.

"{'Responding to a backlash from pain patients, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released updated guidelines Thursday that offer clinicians more flexibility in the way they prescribe opioids for short- and long-term pain.\r\nThe new recommendations eliminate numerical dose limits and caps on length of treatment for chronic pain patients that had been suggested in the landmark 2016 version of the agencys advice, which was aimed at curbing the liberal use of the medication and controlling a rampaging opioid epidemic. Those guidelines cautioned doctors that commencing opioid therapy was a momentous decision for patients.\r\nParts of that nonbinding document were widely misinterpreted, resulting in unintended harm to patients who were benefiting from use of opioids without much risk of addiction. Patients reported they were rapidly tapered off medication by doctors or saw their medication abruptly discontinued, the CDC acknowledged in the new document. Some insurers and pharmacies set rigid limits on duration of prescriptions or dropped patients altogether.\r\nThe new 100 pages of guidance which remain only recommendations for doctors, nurse practitioners, and others authorized to prescribe opioids emphasize returning the focus to the caregiver and patient deciding on the best course of treatment.\r\nThis guideline is really intended to be a mechanism to help patients and providers work together, Christopher Jones, acting director of CDCs National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, said in an interview Thursday. We have leaned in on more principles, rather than thresholds.\r\nThough a record 107,000 Americans died of opioid overdoses in 2021, much about the epidemic has changed since 2016. The number of prescriptions for opioids, which peaked at more than 255 million in 2012, was still at nearly 215 million when the CDC released the first set of guidelines.\r\nBy 2020, that number had declined to 142 million, a reflection of efforts to reduce opioid use in favor of other approaches to pain and a recognition that many addictions begin with prescribed medication.\r\nThe ongoing overdose epidemic is now caused mainly by illegal fentanyl, which is laced into a wide variety of street drugs and consumed, sometimes unknowingly, by users.\r\nYet chronic pain defined as pain that lasts more than three months remains one of the most common conditions suffered by US patients. In 2019, 1 in 5 adults reported chronic pain, and 1 in 14 said it limited life or work activities, according to the CDC. Chronic pain is blamed for $560 billion to $635 billion in direct medical costs, lost productivity, and disability each year, and contributes to 9 percent of suicides, the agency said.\r\nThe new recommendations were proposed in February and sent out for comment from the public and experts before being adopted by the CDC. They took into account research on opioids conducted since 2016. Like the previous version, they are not intended for treatment of pain from sickle cell disease and cancer, or palliative and end-of-life care, which demand special consideration from caregivers.\r\nAt least one group had hoped the guidelines would retain numerical caps in one of the boldfaced recommendations for prescribers. In a March 25 letter, Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, one of the fiercest critics of liberal opioid use, advised highlighting a cap of 50 morphine milligram equivalents as the daily line at which prescribers are likely to face diminishing returns. That number is noted deeper in the guidance.\r\nLike the previous guidelines, the new version recommends that caregivers try non-opioid approaches to pain control before initiating the medication. They also note disparity in the care of people of color, some of whom are less likely to be referred to a pain specialist or receive postpartum pain assessments than white people. Black people also receive lower doses of pain medication than their white peers.\r\nThe new recommendations also include advice on ways doctors and patients can discuss tapering off drugs; a warning that clinicians should weigh benefits and risks and exercise care when changing opioid dosage; and a notice that they should regularly reevaluate benefits and risks of continued opioid therapy with patients.\r\nIn no way is there an intent that they be applied as a one-size-fits-all, Jones said. These are just guideposts.': '{\'PERSON\': [\'Christopher Jones\'], \'DATE\': [\'Thursday\', \'2016\', \'2021\', \'2012\', \'2020\', \'2019\', \'February\', \'March 25\'], \'LOC\': [\'US\'], \'ORG\': [\'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\', ""CDC\'s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control"", \'Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing\'], \'PROGRAMS\': [\'new resource hub\', \'updated guidelines\', \'new 100 pages of guidance\', \'new recommendations\'], \'IMPACT\': [\'more flexibility in the way they prescribe opioids for short- and long-term pain\', \'eliminate numerical dose limits and caps on length of treatment for chronic pain patients\', \'control a rampaging opioid epidemic\', \'unintended harm to patients who were benefiting from use of opioids without much risk of addiction\', \'Patients reported they were rapidly tapered off medication\', \'medication abruptly discontinued\', \'insurers and pharmacies set rigid limits on duration of prescriptions\', \'returning the focus to the caregiver and patient deciding on the best course of treatment\', \'help patients and providers work together\', \'reflection of efforts to reduce opioid use\', \'effort to confront the ongoing overdose epidemic\', \'patients and providers being able to engage in discussions about tapering off drugs\', \'regular reevaluation of benefits and risks of continued opioid therapy\']}'}"
"{'President Joe Biden will meet with Mexican officials Monday\xa0to discuss how to stop\xa0illicit drugs from coming through the southern\xa0border, a problem that continues to fuel a new wave of the deadly fentanyl\xa0crisis\xa0across the United States.\r\nCONTEXT: There were\xa0107,622 drug overdose deaths in 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and\xa0two-thirds of those\xa0deaths were caused by\xa0fentanyl, a synthetic opioid.\r\nMost\xa0illicit fentanyl is mass-produced in ""secret factories"" in Mexico with chemicals obtained from China, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.\r\nFentanyl is highly addictive,\xa050 times more potent than heroin, and only a tiny amount enough to rest on a pencil tip can be fatal.\r\n""Fentanyl is making its way everywhere and into everything,"" said Nick Stavros, CEO of Community Medical Services. Today, the state of Arizona averages 4.5 drug overdoses a day, which is one of the highest overdose rates in the United States. ""It is becoming a huge problem in the state of Arizona,"" said Stavros.\r\nHere\'s what health researchers and overdose prevention workers say are the top solutions to\xa0curb fentanyl addiction and overdose deaths in the United States:\r\nMore medications needed to\xa0treat opioid addiction\r\nPeople who use opioids\xa0need different\xa0exits points and off ramps to get off the drugs, said Susan Sherman, a health behavior professor at the\xa0John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Maryland.\r\nWhether illicit fentanyl is ""sourced from Mexico or whether its sourced\xa0from China, the issue is here with consumption, with lack of scaled-up evidence-based medication-assisted drug treatment,"" Sherman said.\r\nOnly a\xa0small fraction\xa0 roughly 10%\xa0 of people with an opioid addiction\xa0are on medication to treat it, according to\xa0Joseph Friedman, a substance use researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles.\r\n""So there\'s just this huge unmet need, and that\'s an uncontroversial point of failure of our drug policy,"" he said.\r\nUnequal access to health care\xa0means many people have no way to get the life-saving medication, unlike more widely available, government-funded treatment programs for other epidemics, like HIV, he said.\r\nFriedman said the government and the health care system should especially work to make Buprenorphine, which\xa0has ""historically been prescribed to middle and upper class white people,"" more accessible and affordable.\xa0Unlike other treatments that must\xa0be administered\xa0at a clinic each day, Buprenorphine is the first opioid addiction treatment that can be dispensed by family doctors and everyday pharmacies, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\r\nIt\'s not hard to accidentally consume fentanyl.\r\nIllicit drug tablets\xa0laced with fentanyl are often being disguised to look like prescription pain-relief pills. Many\xa0non-opioid drugs including marijuana and\xa0cocaine can\xa0contain fentanyl, unbeknownst to people who use it.\r\nRecent research has\xa0pointed to overwhelming racial disparities\xa0in\xa0synthetic opioid deaths, with mortality rates for Black people more than tripling from 2010-2019, compared to an increase of 58% for non-Hispanic whites.\r\n\'TRASH CANS\': Fentanyl laced with animal tranquilizer fuels already dangerous pill crisis\r\nMore tests are needed to check for fentanyl\r\nAcross the country, people with opioid addictions who use illicit drugs rely on\xa0fentanyl\xa0test strips to know if the substance they\'re about to take\xa0contains fentanyl.\r\n""Imagine you went to a bar and ordered a drink and you don\'t know if they made your cocktail with a tenth of a shot of alcohol or ten shots of alcohol, and the only way you can figure that out is by starting to drink and see how you feel,"" Friedman said.\r\nThe strips use\xa0the same technology as workplace drug tests, they\'re\xa0cheap and they\xa0prevent overdoses\xa0because the fentanyl they\xa0detect is so potent.\r\n""There\'s\xa0all these things that would be great to avoid, so drug checking is a very common sense way to reduce the harm of a really, really toxic drug market,"" Friedman said.\r\nBut the paper test strips, which are considered drug paraphernalia, are illegal\xa0according to\xa0laws on the books in nearly every state\xa0intended to crack down on illicit drugs.\r\nDrug paraphernalia laws\xa0make people who use illicit drugs fearful of seeking help to do so safely because ""theyre viewed as criminals,""\xa0said Alex Kral, an epidemiologist and drug policy expert at the non-profit Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina.\r\nBesides test strips, a small number of U.S. harm reduction programs have machines called Fourier-transform infrared\xa0spectrometers that can test a drug\xa0and detect every substance it contains and its concentration.\r\nIf more places in the United States\xa0could access the machines, Kral said, they could\xa0serve as a surveillance system to alert\xa0the community when dangerous substances enter the supply of drugs.\r\nIf\xa0youre continually testing peoples drugs, you get a sense about whats in the drug supply in general in the city, or neighborhood or town,"" Kral said.\r\n379 million deadly doses: In 2022 the DEA seized enough fentanyl to kill every American\r\n""Rainbow fentanyl"" pills found at the Nogales Port of Entry in Arizona.\r\nWhat are overdose prevention centers?\r\nVulnerable people\'s lives are at risk every day, Kral said, because opioid addiction and overdoses stem from poverty, poor mental health and the availability of contaminated drugs. It\'s important people on the margins of society have a ""trusted"" place they can go to use drugs more safely, he said.\r\nIn New York City, two sanctioned safe consumption sites allow people who use drugs to test them for fentanyl without worrying about getting arrested. The sites, run by OnPoint NYC,\xa0prevented almost\xa0700 overdoses in the past year, executive director Sam Rivera told USA TODAY.\r\nThe sanctioned sites in New York City were the first of their kind\xa0in the United States, according to the Drug Policy Alliance.\r\n""Imagine\xa0 weve had 700 overdose preventions in a little over a year,"" Rivera said.

"{'Over the past year, there have been a number of large settlements with pharmaceutical companies, medical distributors, and pharmacies to account for the harms caused by the overmarketing, distribution, and prescribing of opioids in the late 90s and 2000s. Most recently, Rite Aid reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with the state of West Virginia, and Walmart, CVS, and Walgreens were ordered to pay $650.5 million to two counties in Ohio. These are just some of thecases among dozens that have resulted in billions of dollars in payments to public coffers.\r\nAt the same time, cities and states across the country have made plans to open overdose prevention centers where people can bring pre-obtained substances to use under the presence of trained staff who can intervene in case of overdose. Two sites have opened in New York City and Rhode Island is making plans to open itsfirst site. Meanwhile, Safehouse, a proposed overdose prevention center, is in settlement talks with the Department of Justice to open a site in Philadelphia. The City of Somerville has shown interest in opening a site,but Governor Charlie Baker has refused to address the issue and the Legislature continues to drag its feet. All of this comes on the heels of the Biden administration indicating that it is interested in pursuing a harm-reduction approach,something the Trump administration actively worked against.\r\nWith such large sums of money being doled out, questions arise about the best way to use such funds. Thankfully many of the agreements thus far require the funds to be used to mitigate the overdose crisis, a shift from the 1990s tobacco settlement in which few funds ended up going toward smoking prevention.\r\nNew York City and Rhode Island have recently announced that they will allocate funds toward the operations of overdose prevention centers, allowing these sites more flexibility and freedom to operate than they would have with money from private sources and donations alone. Rhode Island is committing $2.25 million from the $20 million 2023 opioid settlement budget for overdose prevention centers alone.\r\nItsa critical moment for states and cities to approve and financially support these sites using settlement dollars. In 2021 alone, more than 107,000 people across the United States died of an overdose. Research in other countries has shown that overdose prevention centers save lives. Study after study has shown that these sites would save cities considerable amounts of money by preventing infections and fatal and nonfatal overdoses. They also reduce emergency calls, ambulance rides, and emergency department visits for overdoses and drug-related infections.\r\nFor instance, a study released in July by the Rhode Island Department of Health and our team at the Brown University School of Public Health found that one site in Providence has the potential to avert 261 ambulance runs, 244 emergency department visits, and 117 hospitalizations for overdoses in one year. This averted need for emergency care would end up saving more than $1 million annually. But beyond saved costs, reduced overdoses and infection mean a better quality of life for people who use drugs.\r\nOverdose prevention centers also serve as nexus points for naloxone distribution, syringe exchange, wraparound support services, and referrals to health care, housing, and treatment approving these sites and providing them with funds strengthens other harm-reduction and treatment strategies as well.\r\nHowever, running these sites requires real investment. Our study shows that one site in Providence could cost at least $700,000 a year to run. Apart from the costs of running a site and obtaining equipment, its important to recognize that this work like all front-line harm-reduction work is not easy and can expose staff to potentially traumatizing and difficult scenarios. Providing substantial and stable funding that fairly compensates overdose prevention center staff and provides medical and ancillary benefits is essential to ensure staff are adequately supported. Too often, harm-reduction organizations are asked to do this work with shoestring budgets that can barely cover operational costs and yet are asked to play a key role in our societys response to the overdose crisis. Supporting them adequately will mean increases far beyond what states currently provide.\r\nCity and state governments have made slow but important progress in opening overdose prevention centers across parts of the country; however, we are still in the midst of a massive public health crisis and only two sanctioned sites are operating nationwide. For these sites to be as effective as they can be, there needs to be multiple locations and models. More research needs to be undertaken to understand how these centers can operate most effectively in both large urban centers and smaller urban and rural communities.\r\nFinally, we cannot ignore the disproportionate toll the overdose crisis has taken on people of color Black and Indigenous people specifically have faced steep increases in overdose deaths over the past few years and these communities often face barriers to treatment. Previous data on access to treatment show people having differential access to methadone and buprenorphine along lines of racial and ethnic segregation for instance. Since overdose prevention centers provide wraparound services that include access to treatment, its essential that they be accessible, including on-site multilingual staff and support for safe inhalation of substances as not everyone injects drugs.\r\nOpioid settlement funding provides a critical opportunity to turn the tide on overdose deaths. Policymakers across the nation must fund overdose prevention centers as part of a comprehensive and evidence-based response to this crisis.\r\nAbdullah Shihipar directs narrative projects and policy impact initiatives at the People, Place &amp; Health Collective at Brown University School of Public Health.

"{""The approved branded nasal spray from Gaithersburg, Maryland-based Emergent BioSolutions is the best-known form of naloxone.\r\nIt can reverse overdoses of opioids, including street drugs such as heroin and fentanyl and prescription versions including oxycodone.\r\nMaking naloxone available more widely is seen as a key strategy to control the nationwide overdose crisis, which has been linked to more than 100,000 U.S. deaths a year. The majority of those deaths are tied to opioids, primarily potent synthetic versions such as fentanyl that can take multiple doses of naloxone to reverse.\r\nAdvocates believe it's important to get naloxone to the people who are most likely to be around overdoses, including people who use drugs and their relatives.\r\nPolice and other first responders also often carry it.\r\nNarcan will become available over-the-counter by late summer, the company said.\r\nOther brands of naloxone and injectable forms will not yet be available over the counter, but they could be soon.\r\nThe nonprofit Harm Reduction Therapeutics Inc., which has funding from OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, has an application before the FDA to distribute its version of spray naloxone without a prescription.\r\nEven before the FDA's action, pharmacies could sell naloxone without a prescription because officials in every state have allowed it.\r\nBut not every pharmacy carries it. And buyers have to pay for the medication either with an insurance co-pay or for the full retail price. The cost varies, but two doses of Narcan often go for around $50.\r\nThe drug is also distributed by community organizations that serve people who use drugs, though its not easily accessible to everyone who needs it.\r\nEmergent has not announced its price and it's not clear yet whether insurers will continue to cover it as a prescription drug if it's available over the counter.\r\nIt clears the way for Narcan to be made available in places without pharmacies convenience stores, supermarkets and online retailers, for instance.\r\nJose Benitez, the lead executive officer at Prevention Point Philadelphia, an organization that tries to reduce risk for people who use drugs with services including handing out free naloxone, said it could help a lot for people who don't seek services or who live in places where they're not available.\r\nNow, he said, some people are concerned about getting naloxone at pharmacies because their insurers will know they're getting it.\r\nPutting it out of the shelves is going to allows people just to pick it up, not have stigma attached to it and readily access this life-saving drug, he said.\r\nBut it remains to be seen how many stores will carry it and what the prices will be. The U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, which now cover prescription naloxone for people on the government insurance programs, says that coverage of over-the-counter naloxone would depend on the insurance program. The centers have not given any official guidance.\r\nMaya Doe-Simkins, a co-director of Remedy Alliance/For The People, which launched last year to provide low-cost and sometimes free naloxone to community organizations, said her group will continue to distribute injectable naloxone.\r\nOne concern is whether people who buy Narcan over-the-counter will know how to use it properly, said Keith Humphreys, a Stanford University addiction expert, though the manufacturer is responsible for clear directions and online videos on that.\r\nOne benefit of having pharmacists involved, he said, is that they can show buyers how to use it. One key thing people need to be reminded of: Call an ambulance for the person receiving naloxone after it's been administered.\r\nHe also said there are fears that if the drug isn't profitable as an over-the-counter option, the drugmaker could stop producing it.\r\n___\r\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Science and Educational Media Group.

"{'Gomez, 22, of Providence, said he is on methadone and not using drugs. But I know a lot of people who are using, he said. So I have Narcan with me just in case.\r\nIn 2020, accidental overdose deaths reached record levels in Rhode Island. While its still awaiting toxicology reports and final tallies for October, November, and December, the state Department of Health had already recorded 359 accidental overdose deaths through September of last year surpassing the previous record of 336 set in 2016.\r\nJennifer Koziol, the Health Departments drug overdose prevention program administrator, said health officials dont know for certain why accidental overdoses have increased, but said it may be in part from the increasing toxicity of the drug supply. She said a wider variety of drugs are now laced with fentanyl, an extremely potent narcotic that can prove fatal in smaller doses than other opiates.\r\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated widespread loss of jobs is likely also a factor, Koziol said.\r\nIt is definitely exacerbating substance abuse disorders, she said. A lot of people who have been in long-term recovery, feeling solid in their recovery, are relapsing because of everything that is happening.\r\nKoziol said that between COVID-19 and the overdose crisis, Rhode Island finds itself in a syndemic, which she defined as two or more crises impacting a population simultaneously.\r\nYou cant address one without acknowledging the other, she said.\r\nAs part of its response, Rhode Island is using federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act funding to distribute 10,000 kits of naloxone, the overdose reversal medicine, through community organizations such as RICARES. Each kit contains two doses.\r\nGovernor Gina M. Raimondos Overdose Prevention and Intervention Task Force launched Rhode Islands 10,000 Chances Project earlier this month.\r\nWe are trying to saturate the community with naloxone, Koziol said. We are hoping we will see a reduction in overdose fatalities.\r\nThe state is also working with community nonprofits to increase street outreach work with certified peer recovery workers, she said.\r\nCommunity groups are targeting the states hardest hit areas, including Providence, Pawtucket, and Woonsocket, Koziol said. And theyre trying to get naloxone to vulnerable populations, such as people experiencing homelessness, and to the family members and friends of people with substance abuse disorders, she said.\r\nAny Rhode Island resident can get free naloxone delivered to them by going to the preventoverdoseri.org website. Naloxone is safe to use and only works if a person has opioids in their body. If you give naloxone to someone who is overdosing, you are protected by the states Good Samaritan Law and cannot be arrested, the website says.\r\nOn Thursday, Arene-Morley parked a 2006 Subaru Outback next to McAuley House, the Elmwood Avenue meal site and community center sponsored by the Sisters of Mercy, and he began distributing supplies from the rear hatch.\r\nAfter picking up food at McAuley, people formed a line behind the Subaru to receive draw-string bags filled with a pair of socks, a granola bar, and a face mask, along with naloxone kits and fentanyl test strips.\r\nArene-Morley said he has seen the toll taken by accidental overdose deaths up close.\r\nAlmost everyone that I talk to, almost everyone in Rhode Island whether they are a Brown University grad student or whether they are part of this (McAuley House) ministry they know someone who has been lost, he said. And at RICARES we have plenty of close friends who we dont have anymore.\r\nThe majority of the RICARES staff and board members are in long-term recovery from substance use disorder, he said.\r\nWe know that addiction is not really just an issue of the drug, its an issue of childhood trauma, an issue of the undiagnosed mental illness, an issue of systemic oppression in the criminal justice system that keeps people from getting to that next step, he said. So as people with lived experience, we help people go from step to step.\r\nThat help could be as simple as providing someone with a bus pass or as crucial as connecting people with a recovery program or primary-care doctor, he said.\r\nArene-Morley said overdose deaths had been rising even before the pandemic, but COVID-19 is making matters worse. People are losing their jobs, getting behind on the rent, and growing more anxious, he said. All of those are factors that are not helping, he said.\r\nAlso, he said fentanyl is being found not only in opioids but in cocaine, methamphetamines, and counterfeit benzodiazepines like Xanax. It is in almost every drug that people can buy on the street, he said. So that person may not have a problem, but they may still be in danger.\r\nThats why RICARES is distributing fentanyl test kits and naloxone.\r\nNo one thinks, Im going to need the naloxone tonight, Arene-Morley said. But people think Well, Ill test it, and give me the naloxone, why not? So its not a silver bullet, but it gets a foot in the door.\r\nHe said that about half of the people that he gave naloxone kits to on Thursday told him theyd used the medication before to save someone from an overdose.\r\nArene-Morley called for Rhode Island to adopt a more long-term solution by opening overdose prevention sites where people could use drugs under the supervision of health professionals.\r\nSenate Health and Human Services Committee Chairman Joshua Miller, a Cranston Democrat, has introduced a bill that would create an advisory committee and pilot program to establish such harm reduction centers. And Representative John G. Edwards, a Tiverton Democrat, has introduced a similar bill.\r\nArene-Morley said similar programs have proven successful in Canada and Europe. This is not a fringe thing, he said. We know that this is the way to reduce overdose deaths.\r\nHe also called for passing legislation to expand the Good Samaritan Law.\r\nMeanwhile, the focus is on keeping people alive amid the twin threats of the pandemic and the overdose crisis.\r\nOn Thursday, McAuley House case manager Shannon Rivers made sure that Gomez walked away with some food, a new pair of boots, and a tent.\r\nAnd Arene-Morley made sure Gomez left with a naloxone kit. He said RICARES hands out naloxone and basic supplies at McAuley House at lunchtime on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, and at the Mathewson Street Methodist Church in Providence on Sunday mornings.\r\nWith the overdose death toll rising in Rhode Island, it is crucial to get naloxone into as many hands as possible, Arene-Morley said.\r\nIts like a face mask now, he said.

"{'The first wave of funding from multibillion dollar settlements with the opioid industry will go toward expanding treatment programs, increasing the availability of supportive housing for people with substance use disorders, reversing racial disparities in overdose deaths and providing relief for families devastated by the unrelenting opioid epidemic, according to a plan unveiled Friday by Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and the Boston Public Health Commission.\r\nThe new strategies include the creation of a Family Overdose Support Fund, which will provide financial support to Boston families who have lost a loved one to an opioid overdose. The fund will launch later this year with $250,000 to cover child care, funeral expenses, legal services, and other financial burdens faced by those with firsthand experience with the deadly scourge.\r\nThe grief and trauma of losing a loved one to overdose has a lasting impact on our communities, Wu said in a written statement. This fund will help support our families and our communities by easing the financial burdens that undermine a healthy grieving process.\r\nThe announcement culminates months of planning and deliberation by the Boston Public Health Commission, and comes as local and state governments nationwide struggle to reverse year after year of rising overdose fatalities. So far, Boston has collected $6 million through legal settlements from opioid manufacturers and distributors the most of any municipality in the state. Yet like many cities and towns across Massachusetts, Boston has not spent any of the money as it has grappled with how to address the public health disaster.\r\nApart from the new fund, the city did not lay out specific spending amounts for the other proposed investments.\r\nBoston, which ultimately expects to receive $22 million through 2038 from the legal settlements, has taken a deliberative approach to deploying the settlement funds, first seeking input directly from Boston residents and those directly affected by the overdose crisis. Since last summer, the commission has collected more than 400 submissions from an online survey and held eight listening sessions around Boston with more than 200 participants. A majority of respondents wanted to prioritize the needs of grieving families by providing direct financial support, the health commission said.\r\nThere is an overwhelming need to hold these drug manufacturers accountable, said Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, the executive director of the Boston Public Health Commission. And I think that, if allocated appropriately, these funds could help right tragic wrongs, they could save lives, and ... mitigate some of those ongoing harms.\r\nMassachusetts expects to receive almost $1 billion over 18 years from settlements with opioid manufacturers and distributors sued for their roles in the nations staggering toll of overdoses, which remain near record highs and claimed more than 2,300 lives in Massachusetts in 2022.\r\nForty percent of the money is being distributed among municipalities, with the dollar amount based on such factors as the number of opioid-related deaths and the amount of opioids flowing into that community, calculated by population. The remaining 60 percent is being deposited into the statewide Opioid Recovery and Remediation Fund, overseen by the state Executive Office of Health and Human Services.\r\nUnder an agreement, cities and towns that receive the settlement money must spend it on substance abuse prevention, treatment, recovery programs, support for pregnant women with opioid use disorder, as well as harm-reduction strategies that seek to reduce a drug users risk of getting sick or dying, among other strategies.\r\nMassachusetts is slated to receive another $90 million under a separate 2021 settlement deal with Purdue Pharma, producer of OxyContin; but that deal has been held up as the US Supreme Court weighs whether the companys former owners, the wealthy Sackler family, can be shielded from civil lawsuits under the terms of its bankruptcy deal.\r\nIn 2022, 352 people died from opioid overdoses in Boston, up nearly 7 percent from the previous year and more than quadruple the number from a decade ago. From 2019 to 2022, Boston experienced a 36 percent increase in opioid related deaths, more than twice the statewide rate of increase (16 percent) over the same time period. The crisis is disproportionately affecting Black and Hispanic people: Overdose fatalities among Black residents of Boston soared by 29 percent last year, according to state data.\r\nThe increase in overdose deaths has been propelled by the increasingly toxic illicit drug supply, the proliferation of the cheap and highly potent opioid fentanyl, which is deadly even in tiny amounts, and the mixing of opioids with stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine.\r\nOne of the reasons that it took us a long time ... to do this community engagement process is that we wanted to make sure that we were inclusive of communities that have been disproportionately impacted and sometimes left out, Ojikutu said. All of these things have made it so incredibly important that we also acknowledge their desires and needs.\r\nChris Serres can be reached at chris.serres@globe.com.

"{""Now, lawmakers led by Senators Maggie Hassan, Democrat from New Hampshire, and Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, who are joined by four members in the House are reintroducing legislation that would eliminate the rules and urging the president to support the bill, calling on Biden to 'deliver on your promise to expand access to medication-assisted treatment' in a letter shared with The Washington Post.\r\n'This burdensome requirement does not improve patient safety, but does lead to treatment bottlenecks and a lack of providers across the country, particularly in rural areas,' the lawmakers wrote Tuesday, adding that their legislation is the 'best way' to accomplish 'our shared goal.\r\n'We respectfully request that you prioritize the elimination of the X-waiver in order to deliver on your promise to expand access to medication-assisted treatment.'\r\nThe Biden administration is reviewing options to eliminate the waiver, said three administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it.\r\n'Were trying to do things the right way, and that will take some time,' one official said. 'We look forward to working with stakeholders on this issue, including Congress.'\r\n'As overdose deaths rise, its critical that the federal government find ways to expand access to lifesaving medications for opioid use disorder,' said a spokesman for the White House drug policy office. 'For its part, the Office of National Drug Control Policy will continue its efforts to identify the best ways to provide greater access for these medications, reduce overdoses, and save lives.'\r\nMedical groups have hailed buprenorphine as a lifesaving treatment, particularly as the opioid crisis has accelerated during the coronavirus pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that more than 81,000 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United States during the 12-month period ended in May 2020, the highest 12-month death count on record.\r\nPhysicians also have long clamored to be able to more easily prescribe the drug, which blocks the effects of opioids and limits the symptoms of withdrawal.\r\n'Perhaps the Biden administration will eliminate the X-waiver in its own manner. But how can it justify further delay with overdose deaths increasing amid the pandemic?' two Cleveland Clinic psychiatrists wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Monday. 'If the administration lacks the courage to act now, we implore Congress to do so.'\r\nThe Trump administrations plan to get rid of the X-waiver, announced Jan. 14, sought to go around Congresss requirement that physicians obtain a waiver by issuing new 'clinical guidelines' that would have enabled doctors with a Drug Enforcement Administration narcotics-prescribing license to avoid the training. But the plan had legal and operational problems, including a failure to receive necessary clearance from the White House budget office, said two officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter, and the Biden administration formally killed it in a terse 61-word announcement on Jan. 27.\r\nHassan and Murkowski had introduced their bill, the Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment Act, in the previous session of Congress, but it died in committee. The office of Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, Democrat from New York, did not respond to requests for comment about whether he would support it.\r\nThe bill is also supported in the House by New York Democrats Paul Tonko and Antonio Delgado, and Ohio Republicans Anthony Gonzalez and Michael Turner."": ""{{'PERSON': ['Senators Maggie Hassan', 'Lisa Murkowski', 'Biden', 'Chuck Schumer', 'Paul Tonko', 'Antonio Delgado', 'Anthony Gonzalez', 'Michael Turner'], 'DATE': ['the previous session of Congress', 'Jan. 14', 'Tuesday', 'Jan. 27', 'on Monday', '12-month period ended in May 2020'], 'LOC': ['New Hampshire', 'Alaska', 'United States', 'Cleveland', 'New York', 'Ohio'], 'ORG': ['The Washington Post', 'the White House drug policy office', 'the Office of National Drug Control Policy', 'The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Cleveland Clinic', 'Wall Street Journal', 'Drug Enforcement Administration', 'The Trump administration', 'the White House budget office'], 'PROGRAMS': ['Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment Act', 'medication-assisted treatment', 'buprenorphine'], 'IMPACT': ['does not improve patient safety', 'lead to treatment bottlenecks', 'a lack of providers across the country', 'treatment', 'particular in rural areas', 'provide greater access for these medications', 'reduce overdoses', 'save lives', 'blocks the effects of opioids', 'limits the symptoms of withdrawal', 'more than 81,000 drug overdose deaths occurred', 'the highest 12-month death count on record', 'overdose deaths increasing amid the pandemic']}}""}"
"{'Pierre Poilievre, Conservative leader, posted his video Everything feels broken, which features him criticizing the status quo on dealing with overdose issues.Handout\r\nA former public safety and justice adviser to Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper has condemned Pierre Poilievres new video on Vancouvers toxic drug crisis, describing the current party leaders opposition to safe supply as unsubstantiated.\r\nI was really disgusted by it. I honestly was so disturbed to see Pierre Poilievre using peoples really desperate situation here in the city I live in as a backdrop for a political propaganda ad, said Benjamin Perrin, a law professor at the University of British Columbia, in an interview on Monday.\r\nMr. Perrin was referring to a post Sunday titled, Everything feels broken, which features Mr. Poilievre criticizing the status quo on dealing with overdose issues particularly Vancouvers approach of safe supply, or providing drugs that are not contaminated with toxic opioids, to those grappling with addiction.\r\nIt was a five-minute long diatribe thats not informed by any research evidence or expertise. Its just Mr. Poilievre rehashing Conservative, war-on-drugs tropes that have been long since discredited and have been found to be not only ineffective but costly and deadly.\r\nAccording to a report this month from BC Coroners Service, at least 171 people died from toxic drugs in September, amounting to 1,644 fatalities thus far this year. That monthly figure is an 8-per-cent increase over the number of deaths in September, 2021.\r\nPrior to working for Mr. Harper from 2012 to 2013, Mr. Perrin was a law clerk at Canadas Supreme Court. He now teaches criminal and international law, and is the author of several books, including Overdose: Heartbreak and Hope in Canadas Opioid Crisis, published in 2020.\r\nHe also took issue with Mr. Poilievre posting the footage without meeting the media to talk about his policy.\r\nPoliticians should be courageous enough to answer questions when they are going to propose that they have got solutions to a problem as complex and diverse as the opioid crisis instead of just posting a video on their social-media channels and just walking away without being responsible for what they said.\r\nMeanwhile, British Columbias Mental Health and Addictions Minister accused Mr. Poilievre of spreading a dangerous message with his video.\r\nIn a statement, Sheila Malcolmson cited the finding from the recent BC Coroners Service that the vast majority of toxic drug deaths in the province are due to people using illicit substances alone.\r\nPeople hide their drug use due to stigma and shame which is why the message the leader of the Federal Conservative party is perpetuating is dangerous, Ms. Malcolmson said.\r\nOne of the most important ways to save lives from toxic drugs is to separate people from toxic drugs thats why B.C. prescribes safer supply and is the first province in Canada to do this. Its toxic, illicit drugs that are killing people not the provinces prescribed safer supply program.\r\nMr. Poilievres video features him sitting on a downtown Vancouver beach with a tent community behind him.\r\nIn that tent city are people hopelessly addicted to drugs, putting poisons in their bodies, he says.\r\nAs the footage shifts to images of the Downtown Eastside, Mr. Poilievre cites escalating overdose deaths in the province, saying they have soared since Justin Trudeau became Prime Minister in 2015.\r\nHe calls the addictions part of a failed experiment, describing a deliberate policy by woke Liberal and NDP governments to provide taxpayer-funded drugs, flood our street with easy access to these poisons.\r\nHe says Conservatives support increasing resources on Canadas borders to keep precursor ingredients used to make the drugs out of the country, as well as bringing in tougher laws for violent reoffenders and criminal actors preying on those with addiction issues. He adds that he opposes the so-called and ironically named safe-supply approach: There is no safe supply of these drugs.\r\nMr. Perrin criticized Mr. Poilievres suggestion that the crisis is caused by taxpayer-supported drugs as false, attributing the problem instead to street drugs contaminated with the potent opioids fentanyl and carfentanyl.\r\nThere is no indication that prescribed safe supply is contributing to illicit drug deaths, Mr. Perrin said, citing the recent BC Coroners Service report.\r\nSafer supply has been tested and found to be beneficial for people who have been unable to have treatment for whatever reason, and are long-term substance-abuse users. Were talking about essentially substituting a contaminated street drug with a drug that has known contents and potency to help people stay alive, first of all, and also to be able to stabilize.\r\nB.C. introduced prescribed safer supply in May, 2020 and expanded it in July, 2021 with more than 14,000 people from March 2020 to June, 2022 prescribed safer supply medications, include opioids, stimulants and benzodiazepines, and more than 10,000 of those prescribed an opioid, according to a statement from Ms. Malcolmsons ministry.\r\nCarolyn Bennett, the federal Mental Health and Addictions Minister said in a statement that theres a need for a multi-faceted approach to the toxic drug crisis that uses prevention, harm reduction, treatment and enforcement. Safer supply, she said, can reduce hospitalizations, prevent ER visits and save lives.\r\nThe Harper government removed the harm reduction pillar based upon ideology instead of science. We are now continuing to work hard to save lives after those failed policies. Because there is no recovery model for people who are dead. Instead, Mr. Poilievre wants to take Canada back to them, Ms. Bennett said.': ""{'PERSON': ['Pierre Poilievre', 'Stephen Harper', 'Benjamin Perrin', 'Sheila Malcolmson', 'Justin Trudeau', 'Carolyn Bennett'], \n'DATE': ['Monday', 'September, 2021', '2012 to 2013', '2020', 'May, 2020', 'July, 2021', 'March 2020 to June, 2022'], \n'LOC': ['Vancouver', 'the city', 'University of British Columbia', 'Canadas Supreme Court', 'British Columbia', 'Canada'], \n'ORG': ['Conservative', 'BC Coroners Service'], \n'PROGRAMS': ['Everything feels broken', 'safe supply,' 'Overdose: Heartbreak and Hope in Canadas Opioid Crisis', 'prescribed safer supply'], \n'IMPACT': ['1,644 fatalities', '8-per-cent increase over the number of deaths', 'more than 14,000 people from March 2020 to June, 2022 prescribed safer supply medications, include opioids, stimulants and benzodiazepines, and more than 10,000 of those prescribed an opioid']}""}"

BINDIYA:\r\nTHE SEMICONDUCTOR SUPPLY CHAIN\r\nCONTINUES TO BE DISRUPTED.\r\nWE ARE NOT SEEING ANY END IN\r\nSIGHT IN THE NEAR TERM.\r\nWE EXPECT THIS TO CONTINUE INTO\r\n2023. COMPANIES WHO ARE ENTIRELY\r\nRELIANT ON SEMICONDUCTORS\r\n-- ESSENTIALLY FOR THE LONG\r\nTERM. DAVID:\r\nIS THE REASON WHY THIS WILL\r\nWORK ITS WAY OUT IN TWO OR\r\nTHREE YEARS BECAUSE WE ARE\r\nDOING SOMETHING TO FIX IT OR IT\r\nJUST HAS TO WORK ITS WAY OUT?\r\nARE WE DOING ANYTHING TO HELP\r\nTHE SITUATION? BINDIYA:\r\nTHE SITUATION HAS BEEN A LONG\r\nTIME BUILDING AND SO THERE IS\r\nNO TERM -- THE CAPACITY HAS THE\r\nCAPACITY AND IT TAKES SEVERAL\r\nYEARS TO BRING IT UP TO WHERE\r\nIT NEEDS TO GO.\r\nRIGHT NOW WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS\r\nDEMAND FOR SEMICONDUCTORS\r\nCOMING OUT HARD AND FAST FROM\r\nMANY DIFFERENT WAYS.\r\nLOOK AT THE PROLIFERATION OF\r\nDEVICES LIKE AIRPODS WHICH\r\nAPPLE WANTS TO SELL AT HIGH\r\nVOLUME.\r\nALL OF THE WEARABLES ARE NOW\r\nUSING SEMICONDUCTORS.\r\nTHERE IS SO MUCH INCREDIBLE\r\nDEMAND FOR THESE DEVICES THAT\r\nTHE CAPACITY -- DAVID: THE\r\nWHITE HOUSE MEETING IS MAINLY\r\nINFORMATION SHARING.\r\nIT IS NOT THE WHITE HOUSE\r\nSAYING WE WILL DIRECT THE\r\nSUPPLY CHAIN.\r\nHOW MUCH CAN BE HELPED BY\r\nUP-TO-DATE AND ACCURATE\r\nINFORMATION, SOMETHING THAT\r\nRESILINC IS VERY MUCH INVOLVED\r\nIN? BINDIYA:\r\nWE HAVE BEEN WORKING IN SUPPLY\r\nCHAIN TRANSPARENCY FOR THE LAST\r\nDECADE AND I PERSONALLY HAVE\r\nBEEN DOING THIS FOR FAR LONGER\r\nTHAN THAT.\r\nI WILL SAY THERE IS SO MUCH\r\nWORK TO BE DONE.\r\nSUPPLY CHAIN PARTNERS ARE NOT\r\nTRANSPARENT WITH EACH OTHER.\r\nTHEY\'RE NOT WILLING TO SHARE\r\nINFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THEY\r\nBUILD THE PARTS COMPANIES BUY\r\nFROM THEM, WHO ARE THE\r\nSUPPLIERS AND THAT SUPPLY\r\nCHAIN, AND IN PARTICULAR IN\r\nSEMICONDUCTORS IT IS A BIG\r\nPROBLEM BECAUSE THERE IS SO\r\nMANY SMALLER PLAYERS, IT IS A\r\nDIAMOND-SHAPED SUPPLY CHAIN.\r\nTHE MOMENT YOU LOOK AT THE\r\nSUPPLIERS SUPPLIERS YOU LOOK AT\r\nA FEW SMALL, HIGHLY DOMINANT\r\nPLAYERS.\r\nIT IS AN INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT\r\nTOPIC THAT THERE WAS MORE\r\nTRANSPARENCY.\r\nDAVID:\r\nTHERE IS THE SEMICONDUCTOR\r\nPROBLEM, BUT THERE A LOT OF\r\nOTHER SUPPLY PROBLEMS. THINGS\r\nLIKE THE PORTS BEING CONGESTED\r\nAND SHIPPING CONTAINERS.\r\nGIVE US A SENSE OF WHERE WE ALL\r\nOVERALL IT OTHER SUPPLY CHAINS.\r\nBINDIYA:\r\nIS A PERFECT STORM RIGHT NOW.\r\nEVERY AREA YOU CAN THINK OF YOU\r\nFIND SOME LEVEL OF DESTRUCTION.\r\nIF PORTS KINSHIP FROM CHINA\r\nWHERE THEY DID SHUT DOWN GAS\r\nFOR A PERIOD OF TIME DUE TO\r\nCOVID CASES, BUT NOT JUST CHINA.\r\nWE SAW THE SAME ISSUES IN\r\nMALAYSIA.\r\nSHIPS THAT WERE STUCK THERE\r\nCAME BACK.\r\nIN PARALLEL WE HAD DEMAND\r\nBECAUSE OF COMPANIES TRYING TO\r\nFILL HOLIDAY SEASON.\r\nTHEN WE HAVE THE STIMULUS\r\nRELATED DEMAND ITSELF AND PANIC\r\nBUYING. ALL OF THIS HAS CAUSED A\r\nPERFECT STORM WHERE EVERYONE IS\r\nTRYING TO STORE AS MUCH AS THEY\r\nCAN IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN DOES\r\nNOT SCALE UP LIKE THAT.\r\nWE ALSO HAVE RAILCAR ISSUES.\r\nWE HAVE TRUCK DRIVER SHORTAGES.\r\nIT IS NOT JUST A CONTAINER\r\nSHORTAGES.\r\nTHERE ARE BOTTLENECKS IN THE\r\nSUPPLY CHAIN IN EVERY STEP OF\r\nTHE PROCESS. DAVID:\r\nLET ME CONNECT THIS TO WHAT WE\r\nHEARD FROM JAY POWELL YESTERDAY.\r\nWE HEARD SOME OF THE\r\nINFLATIONARY PHENOMENON WE ARE\r\nSEEING ARE TRANSITORY.\r\nSOME OF THEM ARE BECAUSE OF\r\nSUPPLY CHAIN PROBLEMS. IF IT\r\nTAKES TWO YEARS TO FIX THE\r\nSUPPLY CHAIN, THAT DOES NOT\r\nFEEL TRANSITORY.\r\nHOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO GET\r\nTHIS FIXED? BINDIYA:\r\nWE TRACKED ABOUT 30 COMMODITIES\r\nAND OUT OF 30 ABOUT 19 ARE\r\nSHOWING CONSISTENT INFLATIONARY\r\nTRENDS.\r\nWE ARE NOT PROJECTING THESE\r\nPRICES STABILIZING IN THE NEXT\r\nSIX MONTHS. DAVID:\r\nALWAYS GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH\r\nUS. SUCH AN AUTHORITY ON SUPPLY\r\nCHAINS. BINDIYA VAKIL, RESILINC\r\nCOFOUNDER AND CEO.\r\nWE\'LL BE TALKING WITH SENATOR\r\nJOHN ALSO OF GEORGIA ABOUT THE\r\nRAMP-UP IN PRODUCTION OF SOLAR\r\nPOWER EQUIPMENT.\r\nDAVID:\r\nTHIS IS ""BALANCE OF POWER""\r\nON BLOOMBERG TELEVISION AND\r\nRADIO.\r\nPEOPLE ARE STARTING TO RETURN\r\nTO RESTAURANTS, TAKING UP THE\r\nEARNINGS AND THE PROJECTION OF\r\nEARNINGS FOR DARDEN RESTAURANTS.\r\nDAVE WILSON IS HERE TO TELL US\r\nABOUT IT.\r\nWE ARE GOING BACK TO THE MALLS.\r\nDAVE: OR NEARBY.\r\nTHAT IS ONE OF THE LOCATIONS\r\nWHERE YOU FIND DARDEN\r\nRESTAURANT CHAINS.\r\nOLIVE GARDEN IS THE FLAGSHIP OF\r\nTHAT COMPANY.\r\nIT IS ABOUT HALF OF THE REVENUE.\r\nYOU GET ANOTHER QUARTER FROM\r\nLONGHORN STEAKHOUSE.\r\nTHE REST SCATTERED ROUND A\r\nNUMBER OF CHAINS.\r\nBAHAMA BREEZE, THE CAPITAL\r\nGRILLE, AND MANY OTHERS.\r\nIN TERMS OF THE RESULTS, YOU\'RE\r\nTALKING ABOUT THE FISCAL FIRST\r\nQUARTER FOR DARDEN.\r\nTHE TOPLINE AND BOTTOM-LINE\r\nSALES AND EARNINGS BEATING\r\nANALYST AVERAGE ESTIMATES.\r\nTHE COMPANY RAISING FORECASTS\r\nFOR THE FULL YEAR.\r\nBUMPING UP THE LOW END OF THE\r\nRANGES FOR THINGS LIKE SALES\r\nAND EARNINGS MORE THAN THE HIGH\r\nEND.\r\nIN TERMS OF SALES ALLOCATIONS,\r\nCOMPARABLE SALES ARE LOOKING AT\r\nGROWTH THAT MAY BE AS HIGH AS\r\n30%.\r\nIT GOES TO SHOW YOU HOW MUCH\r\nPEOPLE ARE GOING BACK TO\r\nRESTAURANTS.\r\nALREADY DARDEN SALES ARE BACK\r\nTO THE LEVEL THEY WERE BEFORE\r\nTHE PANDEMIC.\r\n$2.3 BILLION FOR A COUPLE OF\r\nQUARTERS IN A ROW AND ANALYSTS\r\nFIGURING THEY COME IN AROUND\r\nTHAT LEVEL FOR THE NEXT COUPLE\r\nOF QUARTERS.\r\nIT HAS BEEN REFLECTED IN THE\r\nWAY THE SHARES HAVE PERFORMED.\r\nDARDEN HAS BEEN UP EVERY YEAR\r\nSINCE 2013.\r\nEVEN LAST YEAR WHEN THE\r\nBUSINESS GOT HIT BECAUSE OF THE\r\nPANDEMIC. THIS YEAR GAINED 34%.\r\nIF THE STOCK CAN SUSTAIN THAT\r\nIT WOULD BE THE BIGGEST ADVANCE\r\nDURING THAT STREAK.\r\nDARDEN HAS FIGURED A FEW THINGS\r\nOUT AND THE SHAREHOLDERS HAVE\r\nBEEN THE BENEFICIARIES. DAVID:\r\nYOU SAID TOPLINE AND\r\nBOTTOM-LINE.\r\nTALK ABOUT A COUPLE OF THE\r\nTHINGS WE HEAR IN OTHER PARTS\r\nOF THE FOREST. WHAT IS SUPPLY\r\nOF WORKERS.\r\nA LOT OF RESTAURANTS HAVE\r\nREPORTED DIFFICULTIES.\r\nALSO THE PRICE OF FOODSTUFFS.\r\nDAVE:\r\nON BOTH CASES, DARDEN PAYING UP.\r\nLATER PROJECTION FOR EXPECTED\r\nINFLATION.\r\nTHEY ARE TALKING SOMETHING\r\nAROUND 4%.\r\nYOU GO BACK TO THE PREVIOUS\r\nFORECAST, THEY ARE LOOKING AT\r\n3%.\r\nTHERE IS NO QUESTION INFLATION\r\nIS BECOMING MORE OF AN ISSUE,\r\nEVEN AS THE COMPANY WORKS ITS\r\nWAY OUT OF THE PANDEMIC.\r\nTHERE IS A LOT THEY HAD TO WORK\r\nTHROUGH.\r\nLOOK AT WHERE THE RESTAURANTS\r\nARE BASED.\r\nONE THIRD OF THEM IN FOUR\r\nSTATES. GEORGIA, FLORIDA, TEXAS,\r\nCALIFORNIA.\r\nYOU\'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME\r\nSTATES THAT HAVE BEEN HIT HARD\r\nBY THE CORONAVIRUS.\r\nTHEY CERTAINLY QUALIFY, EVEN\r\nDOWN THE CASE OF TEXAS AND\r\nFLORIDA.\r\nPUT IT ALL TOGETHER AND IT IS A\r\nCOMPANY THAT HAS HAD TO MANAGE\r\nITS WAY THROUGH A LOT AND BASED\r\nON THE LATEST RESULTS IT HAS\r\nFOUND A WAY TO DO THAT. DAVID:\r\nWHAT ABOUT THE COST OF FOOD?\r\nDAVE:\r\nTHAT IS PART OF THE MIX BECAUSE\r\nTHEY GAVE AN OVERALL INFLATION\r\nMEASURE.\r\nYOU ARE TALKING ABOUT HIGHER\r\nPRICES FOR WHAT ENDS UP ON\r\nTABLES AS WELL AS THE PEOPLE\r\nWHO GET IT THERE AND PREPARE IT.\r\nNO DOUBT DARDEN HAS TO DEAL\r\nWITH INFLATION, BUT AS LONG AS\r\nTHEY CAN RAISE PRICES TO COVER\r\nTHEIR COST, THEY STAND TO\r\nMANAGE EVEN AT A TIME WHEN THEY\r\nARE GOING UP. DAVID:\r\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH TO DAVE\r\nWILSON FOR THAT REPORT ON\r\nDARDEN RESTAURANTS.\r\nCOMING UP WE TALK WITH SENATOR\r\nJOHN OSSOFF OF GEORGIA ABOUT\r\nSOLAR POWER.\r\nDAVID:\r\nTHIS IS BLOOMBERG TELEVISION\r\nAND RADIO.\r\nWE GO TO MARK CRUMPTON.\r\n&amp;gt;&amp;gt; NEW ANALYSIS FROM TWO WHITE\r\nHOUSE ECONOMISTS FIND THE\r\nWELLEST AMERICANS PAY FAR LESS\r\nIN TAXES.\r\nTHEY WERE ABLE TO SLASH THEIR\r\nFEDERAL INCOME TAX BULGES TO AN\r\nAVERAGE OF 8 POW 2% BETWEEN\r\n2010 AND 2018.\r\nPARTLY BECAUSE OF CAPITAL GAINS\r\nRACE.\r\nIN COMPARISON THE URBAN BOOKS\r\nTAX POWELLS CENTER ESTIMATES\r\nTHE TOP 1% PAID AN AVERAGE\r\nEVALUATE OF 23.5% IN 2018.\r\nTHE U.S.\r\nSPECIAL ENVOY FOR HAITI HAS\r\nRESIGNED AS A CRAVES INVOLVING\r\nTHOUSANDS OF REFUGEES TRYING TO\r\nCROSS INTO TEXAS CONTINUES TO\r\nUP FOLD.\r\nIN A LETTER TO SECRETARY OF\r\nSTATE HE SAID HE WONT BE\r\nASSOCIATED WITH WHAT HE CALLS\r\nTHE IN HHUMAN COUNTERPRODUCTIVE\r\nDECISION TO DEPORT THEM BACK TO\r\nHAITI.\r\nHE SAID IT IS DEEP WILL YOU\r\nFLAWED AND HUSBAND\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEENING IN\r\nORDER AND DISMISSED.\r\nTHE FLOW OF LAUGH HAVE FROM A\r\nVOLUNTEER KANG ERUPTION HAS\r\nSLOWED SUGGESTLY RAISING\r\nCONCERNS THAT THE LAVA WILL\r\nSPREAD ACROSS THE LAND AND\r\nANDREW MORE HOMES INSTEAD\r\nFLOWING TWO THE SEA.\r\nABOUT 350 HOMES HAVE BEEN\r\nDESTROYED AND EXPERT ALSO ARE\r\nWORRIED ABOUT WHAT COULD HAPPEN\r\nWHEN THE LAVA REACHES THE\r\nATLANTIC OCEAN.\r\nTHIS COULD CAUSE EXPLOSIONS,\r\nTRIGGER LANDSLIDES AND PRODUCE\r\nCLOUDS OF TOXIC GAS.\r\nGLOBAL NEWS 24 HOURS A DAY ON\r\nAIR AND BLOOMBERG QUICK TAKE\r\nPOWERED BY MORE THAN 2700\r\nJOURNALISTS AND ANALYSTS IT\r\nOVER 120 COUNTRIES.\r\nTHIS IS BLOOMBERG.

CAN WE DO BOTH.\r\nBOTH MILWAUKEE PROGRESS ON THE\r\nISSUE BY NOT UP PORTING SOLAR\r\nPANELS FROM THE WEST OF CHINA\r\nAND MAKE ENOUGH IN THE UNITED\r\nSTATES TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS OF\r\nCONVERTING TO SOLAR IN THE\r\nUNITED STATES? SEN. OSSOF:\r\nWE HAVE TO DO BOTH.\r\nIT IS A MORAL IMPERATIVE.\r\nTHAT IS WHY IM PUSHING SO HARD\r\nFOR THE INCLUSION OF MY SOLAR\r\nBILL IN THIS BUDGET\r\nRECONCILIATION PACKAGEMENT WE\r\nCAN TO THE COMPROMISE ON HUMAN\r\nRIGHTS OR FAIL TO MEET THIS\r\nMOMENT OF TRANSITION TO CLEAN\r\nENERGY.\r\nTHE DESTRUCTION OF OUR HABITAT\r\nIS NOT AN OPTION.\r\nMY GENERATION WONT STAND FOR\r\nIT.\r\nWE HAVE TO ACT ON CLIMATE NOW\r\nAND ACT AGAINST SLAVE LABOR NOW.\r\nI HAVE INTRODUCED THIS\r\nLEGISLATION TO DO BOTH AT ONCE.\r\nBRING THE SOLAR SUPPLY CHAIN\r\nBACK TO THE UNITED STATES, MEET\r\nTHE 40% GOAL BY 2035 AND STOP\r\nRELYING ON PRODUCTS TAINTED BY\r\nCHINESE FORCED LABOR.

"{'WASHINGTON Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra outlined the Biden administrations strategy for curbing drug overdoses Wednesday, committing more federal support for harm reduction techniques like distribution of clean syringes and test strips used to check street drugs for hidden fentanyl.\r\nThe four-part strategy also includes measures to prevent drug addiction, in part by continuing to reduce the inappropriate prescribing of opioids; expand medication-based treatment, which research has shown to be the most effective approach; and improve support for people recovering from substance use disorder.\r\nWith the estimated number of overdose deaths soaring toward 100,000 per year, Becerra said in an interview Tuesday that were changing the way we do this. He added: We know what works. Weve had years of evidence now.\r\nFrom 1999 to 2019, an HHS report released Wednesday notes, 840,000 people died of drug overdoses. By some estimates, there have been 20 to 30 times as many nonfatal overdoses.\r\nPresident Biden campaigned on a major expansion of drug use prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts. Much of what Becerra announced Wednesday, including harm reduction efforts, was contained in a statement of priorities for the administrations first year released in March by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy.\r\nThough some officials oppose it, many experts consider harm reduction a more promising approach than prosecution of drug users or the many failed campaigns to keep drugs from coming into the United States. But it is also a measure of how dire the overdose crisis has become: Fentanyl has so thoroughly infiltrated the illegal drug supply that users often cannot be sure what they are consuming, and the government must act simply to keep them alive and disease-free.\r\nWe really are seeing something weve never seen before, said Jon Zibbell, a senior public health scientist at the think tank RTI International who studies street drug use.\r\nBecerra said the federal government would spend more to expand the distribution of naloxone, the antidote to opioid overdoses, although there is a shortage of the drug currently; fund programs where drug users can exchange used syringes for clean ones, to reduce needle sharing that transmits infections such as HIV and hepatitis C; and distribute test strips that allow users to determine if the powerful opioid fentanyl has been laced into cocaine, methamphetamine, and counterfeit pills.\r\nAsked whether the government would allow supervised consumption sites, the most controversial facet of harm reduction, where people are monitored while using drugs, Becerra said: When it comes to harm reduction, we are looking for every way to do that. . . . We probably will support the efforts of states that are using evidence-based practices and therapies.\r\nBecerra noted that the decision was outside his lane, but as Californias attorney general, he was a supporter of the facilities, where drug users are monitored by staff or volunteers equipped with naloxone and oxygen to respond to overdoses. Some offer referral to treatment and other services to substance abusers.\r\nWidespread in Canada and Europe, the sites are credited with saving many thousands of lives of people who accidentally overdose; no one has ever died in one of the oldest and best-known supervised sites in Vancouver. But some experts and officials believe the facilities encourage drug use and attract drug users to the sites.\r\nUnder the Trump administration, the Justice Department went to court and defeated a nonprofit groups attempt to open such a site in Philadelphia. Any change in government policy would be a major shift in approach. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment. The White House did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday.\r\nJurisdictions including Rhode Island, New York City, Massachusetts, and California are preparing to open such sites, hoping the Biden administration will refrain from cracking down as the drug epidemic grows more critical.\r\nWere looking for innovative ways to address the drug epidemic, said Alex Kral, an epidemiologist with RTI International. If the federal government is finally indicating support for these sites, we can finally see if they are equally helpful in the US as they are around the world.\r\nThe HHS plan also calls for expanding the number of doctors who can prescribe the treatment drug buprenorphine by surmounting rules that require hours of training for those caregivers. It calls for reducing the stigma surrounding substance use disorder that keeps people from seeking treatment. Polls show that many Americans still consider addiction a personal failing or weakness rather than a disease. And the plan acknowledges the need to maximize health equity for disproportionately affected populations as an essential component of each priority area, objective, and activity.': ""{{'PERSON': ['Xavier Becerra', 'Jon Zibbell', 'Alex Kral'], 'DATE': ['Wednesday', 'Tuesday', 'From 1999 to 2019', 'March'], 'LOC': ['WASHINGTON', 'United States', 'Canada', 'Europe', 'Vancouver', 'Philadelphia', 'Rhode Island', 'New York City', 'Massachusetts', 'California'], 'ORG': ['Health and Human Services', 'White House Office of National Drug Control Policy', 'RTI International', 'Justice Department'], 'PROGRAMS': ['harm reduction techniques', 'prevent drug addiction', 'reduce the inappropriate prescribing of opioids', 'expand medication-based treatment', 'improve support for people recovering from substance use disorder', 'drug use prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts', 'harm reduction efforts', 'distribution of naloxone', 'fund programs where drug users can exchange used syringes for clean ones', 'distribute test strips', 'supervised consumption sites', 'equipped with naloxone and oxygen to respond to overdoses', 'treatment and other services to substance abusers'], 'IMPACT': ['federal support', 'reduce needle sharing that transmits infections such as HIV and hepatitis C', 'saving many thousands of lives of people who accidentally overdose']}}""}"
"{'Healthy habits like exercising, getting good sleep, and drinking in moderation could pay off not just in quality of life, but in length of life, too.Thats according to new research presented Monday at the American Society for Nutritions annual conference in Boston, Mass.\r\nResearchers examined the data of nearly 720,000 military veterans ages 40-99, who were followed over time. Those who adopted eight healthy habits saw a 13% reduction in mortality compared to those who did not.\r\nForty-year-olds who adopt all eight healthy habits could gain between 23 (for women) and 24 (for men) years of life expectancy, according to the research team, mostly comprised of Harvard- and Department of Veterans Affairs-affiliated scientists in Boston.\r\nThe benefits of positive lifestyle tweaks were only studied among veterans, Xuan-Mai Nguyena medical student at the Carle Illinois College of Medicine in Champaign, Ill., and a researcher on the studytells Fortune. But it makes sense that they would benefit civilians as well.\r\nThese lifestyle factors are not new ideas, and for the general population to incorporate them into their lifestyle could promote general wellbeing, she says.\r\nSo, just what are the eight healthy habits that apparently extended the lifespan of hundreds of thousands of veterans?\r\n<ol><li>Never smoking: Life expectancy for smokers is at least 10 years shorter than it is for nonsmokers, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The good news: If you quit smoking before age 40, you can reduce the risk of dying from a smoking-related disease by about 90%.</li><li>Being physically active: In the study, those who got 30 minutes or more of moderate or vigorous physical activity a day were considered to be physically active. Such people should be able to walk up a flight of stairs without getting winded, according to Nguyen.</li><li>Not regularly binge drinking: Study participants whose peak daily alcoholic beverages consumption in the past month was four drinks or less were not considered to be binge drinkers. Those who consumed five or more drinks in one day on their heaviest drinking day in the past month were considered to be binge drinkers.</li><li>Getting good sleep: Participants who got, on average, seven to nine hours of sleep a night and didnt suffer from insomnia were considered to have good sleep. Insomnia was defined as having one or more of the following symptoms: difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, and/or early-morning awakenings, along with sleep that isnt refreshing or excessive daytime sleepiness.</li><li>Eating a healthy diet: Those who generally adhered to a plant-based diet were considered to have a healthy diet.</li><li>Living a minimal-stress life: Chronic stress advances ones biological (or epigenetic) clock, potentially shortening their lifespan, according to a 2021 Yale-based study. Thankfully, relaxing can set that clock in reverse.</li><li>Having positive social relationships: Loneliness is a greater risk factor for early death than obesity and physical inactivity, comparable to the risk associated with smoking and drinking, some studies have found. In fact, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy declared loneliness a public health epidemic this year. When it came to the study, participants were considered to have positive social relationships if they had someone to talk to, hug, or otherwise interact with at least 50% of the time.</li><li>Avoiding opioids: U.S. opioid deaths hit a record high in 2021, according to federal data, seemingly fueled by pandemic isolation. Those who use opioids like hydrocodone, fentanyl, and oxycodone for more than two weeks are at risk for addiction. Medications exist to treat those with opioid use disorders, and to make quitting more bearable. But theyre not always readily accessible, according to a White House fact sheet.</li></ol>The three most impactful habits when it came to extending lifespan: exercising, not being addicted to opioids, and not smoking. Those who didnt have these healthy habits were 30%-45% more likely to die during the study.\r\nStress, binge drinking, poor diet, and not getting good sleep were associated with around a 20% increase of death during the study. A lack of positive social relationships added a 5% increased risk of death.\r\nWhile adopting all eight factors by age 40 is ideal, adopting even oneor a fewat any point in life helps, researchers say. A 60-year-old with all eight healthy habits could expect to see just under 20 years gain, and an 80-year-old around 10 years. A 40-year-old with just four of the healthy habits saw about a 10-year increase in life expectancy, and an 80-year-old around five years.\r\nThe earlier the better, but even if you only make a small change in your 40s, 50s, or 60s, it is still beneficial, Nguyen says.': ""{{'PERSON': ['Xuan-Mai Nguyen'], 'DATE': ['Monday'], 'LOC': ['Boston, Mass.', 'Champaign, Ill.'], 'ORG': ['American Society for Nutritions', 'Harvard', 'Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Carle Illinois College of Medicine', 'U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention'], 'PROGRAMS': ['None'], 'IMPACT': ['13% reduction in mortality', '23 (for women) and 24 (for men) years of life expectancy gain']}}""}"
"{'Experts generally point to an increasingly toxic drug supply to explain the rise, with powerful opioids like fentanyl and carfentanil all but replacing heroin and also finding their way into other drugs like cocaine, meth, and counterfeit pills. After several encouraging years of decline, Rhode Island experienced sharp increases in 2020 (384 deaths, then the highest on record) and 2021 (435 deaths, now the highest on record.) So far, state health officials have accounted for 331 overdose-related deaths in 2022, with data still incomplete from July on.\r\nFew states have escaped the trend.\r\nBut Rhode Island will stand apart in 2023 in trying something new, at least by US standards: supervised drug use sites.\r\nA little over a month ago, two organizations the street outreach organization Project Weber/RENEW and CODAC Behavioral Healthcare submitted a joint proposal to the state Executive Office of Health and Human Services for funding to open one on Huntington Avenue in Providence, a building CODAC already owns and operates. The initial $2 million in funding would come through settlement money from opioid makers. Though the funding proposal hasnt been approved, it appears to be the only one that was submitted.\r\nNew York City opened the first sanctioned sites in 2021; attempts in Philadelphia to open them have been tied up in the courts. Canada and Europe have had them for years. For a US state, though, Rhode Island is trying something unprecedented. Green, whos also an adjunct associate professor of epidemiology and emergency medicine at Brown University, doesnt think itll be alone for long.\r\nI think there are more states as well very interested in following the Rhode Island lead, Green said.\r\nThe supervised drug use center the concept also goes by names like safe injection sites, overdose prevention centers, and harm reduction centers became possible in Rhode Island thanks to legislation that passed in 2021. The pilot program comes with a number of regulations.\r\nIf awarded, the organizations would transform the ground floor of CODACs Huntington Avenue building into a supervised drug use center. People would be able to bring their own drugs to use there. Staff on site could offer everything from clean needles to wound care to coats to case management. And given the increasing lethality of the supply, people will be able to test their drugs first for adulterants.\r\nIf someone overdosed, a peer outreach staffer from Project Weber/RENEW would use Narcan to revive them. Medical staff, including a nurse and doctor, would be on site.\r\nUpstairs, CODAC would continue offering medication-assisted addiction treatment to people who want to seek it out. But the idea isnt to force recovery on people; instead its to have it available for when theyre ready.\r\nCODAC said some work will be necessary to prepare the site, but it could be open and operating by June if everything gets approved. The proposal still would need a license from the Department of Health and approval from Providence.\r\nIts grounded in the theory of harm reduction keeping people alive and healthy for long enough to get into recovery if and when theyre ready. Sometimes that means clean needles so people wont get hepatitis C or HIV from using dirty ones; in this case it means giving them a place to use drugs while a trained staffer looks on with an overdose reversal kit, with nurses and doctors waiting in the wings.\r\nWe understand that dead people dont enter recovery, said Annajane Yolken, the overdose prevention center liaison for Project Weber/RENEW. Our No. 1 priority is to save lives. Weve lost too many people. If people arent alive, all these great things we talk about with recovery arent possible.\r\nThe idea of harm reduction in general, and safe drug consumption sites in particular, is not without controversy.\r\nState Rep, Mike Chippendale, a Republican of Foster who is now the minority leader, opposed the legislation for supervised drug use sites in the General Assembly. More needs to be done to reduce the prevalence of drug use before opening up these sorts of sites, Chippendale said.\r\nWe havent done all the work that leads up to it, Chippendale said.\r\nChippendale said he agrees that the opioid epidemic needs to be treated primarily as a health issue. But were not in a position to expect success from safe injection sites, he said.\r\nIn Canada, a report solicited by the government of Alberta raised concerns about the effect on the surrounding neighborhood, about recordkeeping and oversight, and about the lack of referrals to detoxification and treatment services. (Supporters of the sites reject those claims, pointing to studies on their effectiveness at both keeping people alive and increasing engagement in treatment. The fact that the proposed Rhode Island site will be in a place long used for addiction treatment would seem to alleviate nuisance concerns, some supporters say.) California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed legislation that would have created safe drug injection sites in some cities.\r\nLinda Hurley is often at the center of these sorts of discussions. The president and CEO of CODAC, Hurley has a ready response to skeptics: You cant make another adult do anything. If consequence worked, nobody would die of an overdose or end up back in jail. Overdose prevention centers, she said, will keep people safe until theyre ready to make their own choices.\r\nI really dont have any doubt in my mind that its going to work, Hurley said.\r\nWhat does work mean?\r\nIt means its going to save lives, Hurley said.\r\nAt this point, the legislation is still just a pilot, and it expires March 2024. Discussions are underway to extend that sunset, Project Weber/RENEW said. The funding is also temporary. CODAC and Project Weber/RENEW would have to find ongoing support for the program.\r\nGiven the severity of the crisis, its one of several steps state health leaders said are necessary to stem the tide, which also includes meeting people where they are church communities, nursing homes and pushing more Narcan into the community.\r\nBut its a significant one, and it tends to draw attention.\r\nWhenever I look at the overdose prevention centers, I look at the opportunity to have that person be exposed to services, or, as I say, theyre going to get exposed to hope, said Thomas Joyce, the community co-chair of the governors overdose task force. In the recovery community, we sell hope its what we do on a daily basis.\r\nOn a drizzly recent December weekday, the scale of the need could be seen at Project Weber/RENEWs Pawtucket drop-in center, which seemed extremely busy to an outsider, but actually wasnt.\r\nThis is actually slow, Chirrell Robinson, a peer recovery advocate, said with a sort of shrug while staffers hustled about and clients waited in the crowded front vestibule.\r\nPeople go to Project Weber/RENEW for everything from clean needles to coats to Narcan, which can reverse overdoses. But they have to come first. In recent weeks, multiple people in the surrounding area had died of drug overdoses in quick succession. A supervised drug use center, Robinson believes, would help.\r\nAt least this way, we wont be finding people dead in tents and cars, Robinson said.\r\nFor all the questions these sorts of sites raise, supporters point to one key statistic from the experience in Europe and Canada.\r\nIn the history of overdose prevention centers, no one has ever died of an overdose, said Lex Morales, sitting behind his desk at the Pawtucket drop-in center, where he is the director. Like a lot of people at Project Weber/RENEW, he is in long-term recovery from substance use disorder. So its going to save lives.\r\nIt will also help the community more broadly, said a man named Charles, who went from being a client to being a worker at the organization.\r\nWhen I was out there using, I would go into public bathrooms, restaurants, grocery stores, the Kennedy Plaza bathroom, said Charles, who asked to use only his first name for this story. So its going to help the community out. I wasnt thinking about who was seeing what, or if I was leaving a needle lying around. So I think its a great idea.\r\nThe center wont just be a place for people to use drugs, supporters said. It will also offer people the opportunity to get help navigating the Medicaid system, or with food and housing insecurity. And if theyre ready, theyll have treatment available, although it wont be high-pressure, in-your-face type think of a poster on the wall rather than someone stuffing a flier in everyones hand.\r\nThe key word is ready, and its different for every person.\r\nFor Charles, that moment came in Boston, when he woke up one morning a few years ago in a park alongside the Charles River in Boston and decided that he was either going to give up the life he was living he did about every substance except crack and had overdosed twice or kill himself. He chose the former. Now he goes to the Charles River to kayak.\r\nFor a man named Angel, a Project Weber/RENEW client, that day hadnt come. Nobody was pressuring him to get there or judging him for not doing so.\r\nI think recovery is beautiful, if you want to live that life to each his own, Angel said.\r\nIn the meantime, he stops in at Project Weber/RENEW. And hed consider using the supervised drug use site theyre planning to open.\r\nOf course, he said. You dont have to worry about the cops busting you, you dont have to worry about sneaking around, youre not leaving stuff around. It would be way better.\r\nBrian Amaral can be reached at brian.amaral@globe.com.

"{'Two years ago, Minnesotans who carried thin strips of paper for detecting whether street drugs contain fentanyl could be arrested and charged with possession of drug paraphernalia.\r\nNow, those paper strips no more than a few inches long have emerged as a vital tool in the state\'s fight to prevent opioid overdoses, which continue to claim hundreds of lives in Minnesota each year.\r\nNonprofit community groups and health clinics have given away more than 100,000 of the fentanyl test strips since Minnesota legalized them in July 2021.\r\nThe strips are already changing user behavior: The vast majority of people who discover fentanyl in their drugs using the strips have taken steps to reduce the risks of a deadly overdose, according to surveys by Minnesota providers.\r\nThe Steve Rummler Hope Network, the state\'s largest provider of free fentanyl test kits, has surveyed 722 people who have used the strips since October 2021. Of these, 90% said they changed their behavior to reduce overdose risk. Some 31% of respondents said they decided not to use the drug, while 23% chose to increase safety by using in a group or with another person. Others said they took smaller doses or slowed their drug intake, according to the participant survey.\r\nThose findings are consistent with a smaller survey by NorthPoint Health and Wellness Center in north Minneapolis, which found that 89% of test strip users took overdose-prevention measures once they discovered fentanyl.\r\n""Fentanyl test strips are gold,"" said Dr. Charles Reznikoff, an addiction medicine doctor with Hennepin Healthcare, who hands out the strips to many of his patients. ""It not only saves lives, it serves as a reminder to the person that fentanyl may be present in whatever drug they may be using and is deadly.""\r\nA surge in fatal overdoses has heightened the urgency of efforts to distribute the test strips.\r\nIn 2021, overdose fatalities reached 1,286 up 22% from the previous year and the highest in at least the past decade. Through an analysis of death certificates, the Minnesota Department of Health found that fentanyl a synthetic opioid up to 50 times stronger than heroin was involved in 90% of all deaths linked to opioid use that year. Because it is cheap, potent and plentiful, fentanyl is being mixed into a growing number of opioids to produce a stronger high.\r\nThe fentanyl test strips are part of a broader approach known as harm reduction, which seeks to give people tools to reduce their risk of dying or contracting infectious disease rather than emphasizing abstinence.\r\nThe paper strips work much like over-the-counter pregnancy tests. Each strip is dipped into a small amount of water containing a bit of drug residue. After a couple of minutes, either one or two red lines appear on the strip. One line means the liquid contains fentanyl; two lines means the test did not detect the drug. The strips can detect fentanyl in all types of drugs, including heroin, cocaine and counterfeit pain pills, and in different forms (pills, powder, and injectables).\r\n""One reason the fentanyl test strips are so useful is there is a full-tilt industry of producing fentanyl, and right now it\'s humming,"" Reznikoff said. ""There\'s a ton of [fentanyl], and that\'s why it keeps being put in all these different [drugs] and keeps killing people.""\r\nOn a blizzardy morning, Gabe Lyrek, a harm reduction specialist, demonstrated how the strips work from the NorthPoint\'s harm reduction and testing services center in north Minneapolis, which provides the strips and other tools free of charge.\r\nSlowly, Lyrek poured a tiny amount of sterile water from a test kit into an aluminum cup, sometimes called a ""cooker"" by drug users. Then he sprinkled in a sample of vitamin C powder no more than the diameter of a pencil into the cup and stirred it carefully. He then dipped the wavy end of the paper test strip into the mixture and waited 15 seconds before removing it. Within two minutes, the paper showed two pink lines a negative result confirming that fentanyl was not in the sample.\r\nLyrek and his team at NorthPoint have handed out more than 2,700 of the test strips since they were decriminalized the most of any on-site location in the state.\r\n""Once you know there\'s fentanyl in [the sample], then you can make an informed decision,"" Lyrek explained. ""You can use slower. You can use less. You can dilute your drugs more. But there are always other options once you find out that can prevent you from overdosing.""\r\nStaff at the NorthPoint harm reduction and testing services center are reminded daily of the high stakes of their efforts to educate users about the benefits of the test strips and other harm-reduction tools such as sterile syringes.\r\nAbout two months ago, a woman overdosed and was no longer breathing in a church parking lot adjacent to the center at 710 W. Broadway. When she was discovered by security guards, Lyrek and others rushed outside to help. It took mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and five doses of Narcan, a drug that reverses the effects of opioids, to revive the woman.\r\n""It\'s scary, because every time someone walks in here, that might be the last time you see that person,"" Lyrek said. ""That\'s why we really try to develop relationships with people and let them know we care.""\r\nThe need for fentanyl test kits has become so intense that it\'s now possible to buy them through Amazon.com and have them delivered to one\'s doorstep. While harm reduction specialists praise the growing availability of the strips, they encourage one-on-one visits to clinics and testing centers where they are available. Every time a fentanyl test kit is handed out, clinicians say, is another opportunity to talk to users about the deadly risks of fentanyl and ways to avoid overdosing.\r\n""Out of everything that we provide here, the most important thing of all is the fact that we care about you,"" Lyrek said. ""You don\'t know our name. We don\'t know your name. But the second you walk in that door, you have somebody who cares whether you live or die.""\r\nStaff writer Kim Hyatt contributed to this report.': ""{'PERSON': ['Steve Rummler', 'Dr. Charles Reznikoff', 'Gabe Lyrek', 'Kim Hyatt'], 'DATE': ['Two years ago', 'July 2021', 'October 2021', '2021'], 'LOC': ['Minnesota', 'north Minneapolis'], 'ORG': ['Minnesota Department of Health', 'NorthPoint Health and Wellness Center', 'Hennepin Healthcare', 'Steve Rummler Hope Network', 'NorthPoint harm reduction and testing services center', 'Amazon.com'], 'PROGRAMS': ['fentanyl test strips', 'resource hub'], 'IMPACT': ['have taken steps to reduce the risks of a deadly overdose', '90% said they changed their behavior to reduce overdose risk', 'the strips can detect fentanyl in all types of drugs', 'a woman overdosed and was no longer breathing in a church parking lot adjacent to the center']}""}"
"{'Masimo (NASDAQ: MASI) today announced that Masimo Opioid Halo™, an opioid overdose prevention and alert system, has been granted a De Novo by the FDA – making it the first and only FDA-cleared monitoring solution for detecting opioid-induced respiratory depression, the leading cause of death from opioid overdose. With the De Novo, Masimo also becomes the first winner of an FDA Opioid Innovation Challenge to have an authorized solution designed to help solve the U.S. opioid crisis. The De Novo authorizes Opioid Halo to be made available over the counter (OTC) without a prescription, for use on adults and children age 15 and up, and an Rx version for use by prescription from a healthcare provider. Opioid Halo advances the forefront of continuous monitoring through its unique Opioid Halo engine, an advanced pattern recognition algorithm which helps detect and quantify the risk of severe opioid-induced respiratory depression. Combined with its innovative distributed architecture, Opioid Halo helps to manage and send escalating alarms to family members, friends, and caregivers, notifying them that help may be needed due to an opioid overdose – including triggering an automatic wellness call, which may lead to EMS being dispatched.\r\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230403005131/en/\r\nMasimo Opioid Halo™ (Photo: Business Wire)\r\nJoe Kiani, Founder and CEO of Masimo, said, “We are very excited to be able to offer this solution to our fellow Americans and the community heroes who are helping to battle the opioid crisis – a crisis so devastating in its impact on the young that it has lowered overall life expectancy in the U.S. Now, with Opioid Halo, we hope to help make a big difference by providing a much needed tool that can help millions, whether they are taking prescribed opioids or struggling with illicit opioid use. In 2018, we were honored to be chosen by the FDA, based on our expertise in patient monitoring technologies, to develop a device that could help prevent opioid overdose, as part of their Innovation Challenge addressing the opioid epidemic. And today, we are delighted to have received the first De Novo for our response to that Innovation Challenge, Masimo Opioid Halo. Between then and now, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated our development and refinement of the Masimo SafetyNet® family of remote patient management and telehealth solutions, helping save many COVID patients’ lives. We thank the FDA for taking on the opioid epidemic and granting this De Novo – a clearance that is a huge step forward in preventing overdose deaths and helping to end the opioid crisis.”\r\nOpioid overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the US, responsible for more than 80,000 of the approximately 100,000 drug-related deaths in 2021, from both illicit opioids, such as fentanyl and heroin, and prescription opioids. Hundreds of thousands more suffer non-fatal overdose events, or the loss of a family member or friend to opioids.1 Opioids are readily prescribed in the US, with more than 143 million opioid prescriptions written in 2020,2 because they can be an effective way to help people manage pain, including after surgery or for chronic conditions. However, opioids also carry serious side effects, especially opioid-induced respiratory depression – slowed or stopped breathing –which is the leading cause of death from opioid overdoses.3 Anyone taking opioids, prescription or illicit, is at risk of experiencing an accidental overdose, the signs of which are unpredictable and can be difficult to detect.\r\nMasimo Opioid Halo is designed to help family and friends identify the symptoms of an opioid overdose by detecting physiological markers present during opioid-induced respiratory depression and ideally, helping them know when it’s time to intervene – for example, by administering a potentially life-saving dose of naloxone. Opioid Halo can be used at home or in the hospital or another care setting, by patients prescribed opioids after surgery or managing a chronic or prolonged condition, as well as people suffering from opioid use disorder.\r\nThe Opioid Halo system consists of four components: 1) a tetherless, adhesive fingertip sensor; 2) a reusable Masimo SET® pulse oximeter and Bluetooth® chip; 3) a Bluetooth-to-Wi-Fi Masimo Home Medical Hub; and 4) a smartphone app. The fingertip sensor provides real-time monitoring for opioid-induced respiratory depression, enabled by the Opioid Halo pattern recognition algorithm and Masimo SET®, Signal Extraction Technology® – even during movement, when hands are cold, and on all skin pigmentations. Data from the sensor and chip are wirelessly relayed to the Masimo Home Medical Hub and the smartphone app, which continuously analyzes the user’s physiological data for trends and patterns associated with the physiology of an opioid-induced respiratory depression event to quantify the risk of an opioid overdose. As the level of risk rises, the app and hub provide alerts. Upon early onset, an audible and visual alarm, designed to trigger early intervention opportunities for the user to self-recover or get help, is provided. If the Opioid Halo risk score continues to worsen, in addition to the repeated alarms, automatic texts are sent to designated friends and family members, letting them know it may be time to intervene, for example by administering naloxone or taking other action. Finally, if the severity of the risk level progresses even further, there is an optional setting that can be activated during setup that enables a service center to place an automatic wellness call to the user, the outcome of which may lead to EMS being dispatched.\r\nKim Bennion, MsHS, RRT, CHC, FAARC, System Director of Research for Respiratory Care Clinical Services at Intermountain Health, a 33-hospital system based in Salt Lake City, Utah, said, “Painkillers often called ‘opioids’ can have negative side effects, including opioid-induced respiratory depression. Intermountain Health has demonstrated that home monitoring of post-surgical patients receiving opioids for pain can help identify issues earlier and avoid adverse outcomes. As a registered respiratory therapist and leader in the field of opioid-induced respiratory depression in the post-surgical setting, we are excited that Masimo’s breakthrough device will be available for our patients.”\r\nRyan Hampton, a noted advocate, author, and person in recovery, said, “Joe Kiani and his team at Masimo are strong advocates for solutions to help end the overdose crisis. Opioid Halo is another breakthrough innovation that can help save lives by adding to the critical support tools for people who use drugs.”\r\n“My son Parker lost his life after taking prescription opioids to manage his pain after a tonsillectomy,” said Yvonne Gardner, now a patient safety advocate. “No one warned us that this could happen. This technology can help save other parents from losing a child.”\r\nMasimo CEO Kiani added, “For more than 30 years, Masimo has been empowering clinicians with life-saving technologies that improve outcomes for countless patients around the world. Opioid Halo furthers our mission to expand beyond the hospital and into the home, empowering everyday people with a solution that we believe has the power to improve and save many more lives.”\r\nFor more information about Masimo Opioid Halo, and to pre-order it today for a loved one, a community hero, or an organization, visit opioidhalo.com.\r\n@Masimo | #Masimo\r\nAbout Masimo\r\nMasimo (NASDAQ: MASI) is a global medical technology company that develops and produces a wide array of industry-leading monitoring technologies, including innovative measurements, sensors, patient monitors, and automation and connectivity solutions.

"{'Today is April 20th, otherwise known as 4/20 day or ""Weed Day,"" a day that has become associated with cannabis use across the world. But it also provides an opportunity to shed light on interesting recent research surrounding medical cannabis, some of which indicates that the judicious use of medical cannabis could help reduce the misuse of prescription opioids.\r\nUnderstanding prescription opioid misuse\r\nPrescription opioids are a class of painkillers often prescribed by physicians for people experiencing chronic pain. Such pain can derive from a variety of sources, including accidents, injuries, or military service, as well as from the wear and tear of everyday life.\r\nDespite their ability to dull and lessen pain, prescription opioids have many side effects; specifically, they can be addictive. This can lead to opioid misuse by unwary individuals who started taking opioids on a doctors advice in a sincere effort to control pain. One survey indicates that over 10 million Americans misuse prescription opioids. Such misuse can be very dangerous. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that opioids were implicated in around 450,000 deaths in the U.S. from 1999 to 2018, and around 35,000 Americans died from overdoses related to the misuse of prescription opioids in 2019 alone. Moreover, the misuse of prescription opioids can lead to severe impairments in areas such as employment, education, and relationships.\r\nImportantly, surveys indicate higher rates of prescription opioid misuse in men than women; men account for around 70 percent of opioid overdose deaths. Some research suggests that men are disproportionately driven to prescription opioid misuse to control pain incurred in dangerous workplaces such as manufacturing, transportation, the military, or law enforcement fields in which men comprise the vast majority of the workforce.\r\nSuch men may be prescribed opioids by physicians and become slowly addicted over time. This can lead them to seek greater dosages from their doctors or to try obtaining prescription opioids on the black market, contributing to more severe addiction and a downward spiral resulting in the aforementioned impairments and overdoses.\r\nCan medical cannabis help?\r\nA growing corpus of research indicates that certain strains of medical cannabis (particularly strains rich in cannabidiol) have powerful pain-killing properties and can be a beneficial agent in chronic pain management. Indeed, some emerging research suggests that medical cannabis can provide a much-needed alternative to prescription opioids and may even mitigate some aspects of the opioid crisis. \r\nFor example, one seminal research study showed that U.S. states with medical cannabis laws had significantly lower rates of opioid overdose deaths compared to U.S. states without such laws, implying that pain sufferers often choose medical cannabis over opioids when such a choice is available.\r\nThis is consistent with my own research on Canadian military veterans living with chronic pain. Many reported that they were originally prescribed opioids for pain relief but that the side effects became intolerable. Given that cannabis is legal in Canada, they decided to use medical cannabis instead, which brought many benefits. This is illustrated in the veterans own words in the short but poignant video below:\r\nThe way forward\r\nA solid body of research indicates that the misuse of prescription opioids remains a massive health and social issue in the U.S. Meanwhile, a related body of research shows that medical cannabis can be an effective pain killer and is a preferred agent for many people living with chronic pain.\r\nHowever, the medical establishment has been slow to integrate such knowledge into everyday practice, perhaps due to (i) lack of training in medical cannabis; (ii) enduring stigmas associated with cannabis use and cannabis users; and (iii) concerns about prescribing a substance of ambiguous legal status. All this implies a need for concerted efforts to destigmatize cannabis use and raise awareness about emerging medical research on the topic, with such efforts targeted at medical practitioners and other influential stakeholders (e.g., teachers and employers), as well as the general public.\r\nThis could help create a climate in which medical cannabis becomes an accepted and legitimate option for people suffering from chronic pain, providing an alternative to opioid prescriptions. This, in turn, may help mitigate some aspects of the opioid crisis.\r\nLets weed out the cannabis myths now.': ""{{'PERSON': ['None'], 'DATE': ['April 20th', '1999 to 2018', '2019'], 'LOC': ['U.S.', 'Canada'], 'ORG': ['Centers for Disease Control and Prevention'], 'PROGRAMS': ['None'], 'IMPACT': ['over 10 million Americans misuse prescription opioids', 'opioids were implicated in around 450,000 deaths in the U.S. from 1999 to 2018', 'around 35,000 Americans died from overdoses related to the misuse of prescription opioids in 2019', 'misuse can lead to severe impairments in areas such as employment, education, and relationships', 'U.S. states with medical cannabis laws had significantly lower rates of opioid overdose deaths compared to U.S. states without such laws', 'pain sufferers often choose medical cannabis over opioids when such a choice is available']}}""}"
"{'LA JOLLA, Calif., March 09, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MediciNova, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company traded on the NASDAQ Global Market (NASDAQ:MNOV) and the JASDAQ Market of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (Code Number: 4875), today announced it has partnered with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to repurpose MN-166 (ibudilast) as a potential medical countermeasure (MCM) against chlorine gas-induced lung damage such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI). Under the Division of Research, Innovation, and Ventures (DRIVe) Repurposing Drugs in Response to Chemical Threats (ReDIRECT) program, BARDA will provide funding for proof-of-concept studies of MN-166 in preclinical models of chlorine gas-induced acute lung injury. MN-166 is the first compound to receive BARDAs development support through the DRIVe ReDIRECT program. Kazuko Matsuda, M.D., Ph.D., M.P.H., Chief Medical Officer of MediciNova, Inc., commented, On behalf of the entire MediciNova team, we are grateful for the opportunity to partner with BARDA in an effort to repurpose MN-166 as a rapidly administered treatment for patients exposed to chemical agents such as chlorine. MN-166 attenuated histological changes observed in an ARDS animal model, including pulmonary edema in lung tissue, and protected against pulmonary injury by reducing cellular apoptosis in lung tissue. Considering that pulmonary edema is a hallmark feature of exposure to chlorine, MN-166 has the potential to improve health outcomes and save lives. To date, more than 800 research participants have been treated with high-dose MN-166 in MediciNovas clinical trials. MN-166 has shown a benign safety and tolerability profile. This project has been funded in whole or in part with Federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services; Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, under Contract No. 75A50121C00022. About MN-166MN-166 is a small molecule compound that inhibits phosphodiesterase type-4 (PDE4) and inflammatory cytokines, including macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). It is in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), progressive MS (multiple sclerosis), and DCM (degenerative cervical myelopathy), and also for glioblastoma, CIPN (chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy), and substance use disorder. In addition, MN-166 is being evaluated in patients with COVID-19 that are at risk for developing ARDS. About ReDIRECT BARDA established the ReDIRECT project to repurpose commonly available therapeutics as MCMs against chemical threats (e.g., cyanide, opioids, nerve agents, chlorine, sulfur mustard, etc.). During a chemical emergency, minutes matter and a rapid response is necessary to save lives and reduce the incidence of adverse health effects. Drug repurposing is a strategy that is used to identify new uses for FDA approved or late-stage investigational therapeutics outside of their original clinical indication. The identification of existing and commonly available therapeutics for repurposing as MCMs holds the potential to expand current response capabilities to chemical threats and strengthen the United States preparedness posture. About MediciNova MediciNova, Inc. is a publicly-traded biopharmaceutical company founded upon developing novel, small-molecule therapeutics for the treatment of diseases with unmet medical needs with a primary commercial focus on the U.S. market. MediciNova\'s current strategy is to focus on MN-166 (ibudilast) for neurological disorders such as progressive multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), substance dependence (e.g., alcohol use disorder, methamphetamine dependence, opioid dependence) and glioblastoma (GBM), as well as prevention of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by COVID-19, and MN-001 (tipelukast) for fibrotic diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).

"{'MEXICO CITY — High-level delegations from Mexico and the United States on Friday laid out the outlines of a new security framework between the nations that at least conceptually marked a departure from the mindset that steered their cooperation over the past decade.\r\nThe so-called U.S.-Mexico Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health and Safe Communities seeks to move beyond the 13-year-old Merida Initiative that focused on building Mexicos crime-fighting capabilities and rule of law projects.\r\nIts time for a comprehensive approach to our security cooperation, one that will see us as equal partners in defining our shared priorities, tackle the root drivers of these challenges like inequity, like corruption and focus not only on strengthening law enforcement, but also public health, the rule of law, inclusive economic opportunities, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday.\r\nMexico Foreign Affairs Secretary Marcelo Ebrard put it more succinctly: Goodbye Merida, welcome Bicentennial agreement.\r\nThe first substantive difference is that the Merida Initiative was, from the point of view of Mexico, focused on the thesis that the cartel capos had to be captured and that was sufficient, Ebrard said. Now they see that wasnt enough, that attention must be paid to expanding opportunities for youth and treating addiction, he said. The success of this is going to be measured in fewer homicides in Mexico and less drug consumption.\r\nThat shift in emphasis is in line with President Andrés Manuel López Obradors hugs, not bullets refrain and his stated uninterest in pursuing the leaders of Mexicos cartels.\r\nThe two governments joint declaration devoted considerable space to treating drug addiction — especially opioids and its societal effects in the public health context, a significant departure from Meridas emphasis on the criminal justice system.\r\nThe U.S. pledged to devote more resources to identify and treat people affected by opioids and Mexico committed to working with the United Nations to launch a program to better manage shipping containers to limit the importation of chemical precursors for synthetic drugs like fentanyl.\r\nMexico seized an estimated 1.3 tons of the synthetic opioid last year. That same year, the U.S. recorded 93,000 drug overdose deaths.\r\nThe governments committed to targeting importers of chemical precursors for fentanyl and methamphetamine, their financial networks and secret labs.\r\nThey also said they would work together to reduce the trafficking of guns, a high priority for violence-wracked Mexico, and to provide more opportunities to youth to make it harder for criminal organizations to recruit them.\r\nWe need to deal with the violence, dismantle the transnational criminal organizations and focus on prevention with the goal of creating the conditions for a culture of peace, while we work hand-in-hand to address the fundamental causes of crime, the joint statement said.\r\nMexicos Public Safety Secretary, Rosa Icela Rodríguez Velázquez said, for many years, the issue of Mexicos security has been addressed from the point of view that its only measured by the use of force, now we are combatting the causes that originate that violence with social programs, intelligence and coordination, listening to men and women in their towns, their municipalities and communities.\r\nImmigration is expected to be a key topic of the dialogue. López Obrador has been saying for months that Mexico cannot continue to simply detain migrants and try to contain them in the southern part of the country, far from the U.S. border.\r\nHe has asked the U.S. government to invest in two of his signature social programs to relieve some of the economic pressure people feel to migrate. The Biden administration needs Mexicos continued cooperation to manage the flow of migrants to the U.S. border.\r\nThe U.S. also must find a way to re-instate the controversial Trump-era policy that made asylum seekers wait out their cases in Mexico. Under the so-called Migrant Protection Protocols, tens of thousands of asylum seekers waited in dangerous Mexican border cities for their cases to advance. Biden had made cancelling the policy one of his first orders of business upon taking office, but the Supreme Court ordered that it be implemented again. Ebrard said that issue was not discussed Friday.\r\nMexico has also been pressing for the U.S. government to do more to stop illegal guns from pouring in from the U.S. The guns fuel Mexicos organized crime violence, creating a public safety issue that López Obradors government has been unable to adequately address.\r\nBoth sides were also expected to discuss the role of U.S. agents in Mexico and intelligence sharing. The governments insist that their security agencies work closely on a daily basis. But following the United States arrest of former Mexican Defense Secretary Salvador Cienfuegos, then his release after Mexicos loud protests, tensions have persisted.\r\nCienfuegos was arrested after he was secretly indicted by a federal grand jury in New York in 2019. He was accused of conspiring with the H-2 cartel to smuggle thousands of kilos of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana while he was defense secretary from 2012 to 2018.\r\nWith Cienfuegos back, Mexico said it would perform its own investigation, but it was quickly closed. López Obrador attacked U.S. prosecutors case against the general and accused the Drug Enforcement Administration of fabricating the case.\r\nMexico restricted U.S. agents working in the country and lifted their diplomatic immunity.\r\nAt a breakfast with both delegations Friday, López Obrador said it would be very unfortunate if we didnt understand each other, if our cooperation, the friendship between our governments and our peoples wasnt strengthened.\r\nThe goal is to have a three-year plan ready by the end of January.\r\nAP writer Fabiola Sánchez contributed to this report.': ""{'PERSON': ['Antony Blinken', 'Marcelo Ebrard', 'Andrés Manuel López Obrador', 'Rosa Icela Rodríguez Velázquez', 'Salvador Cienfuegos', 'Fabiola Sánchez'], 'DATE': ['Friday'], 'LOC': ['MEXICO CITY', 'Mexico', 'United States', 'NY'], 'ORG': ['U.S.-Mexico Bicentennial Framework for Security, Public Health and Safe Communities', 'United Nations', 'Mexicos Public Safety Secretary', 'Biden administration', 'Supreme Court', 'Mexican Defense Secretary', 'H-2 cartel', 'Drug Enforcement Administration'], 'PROGRAMS': ['Merida Initiative', 'treat drug addiction', 'treat people affected by opioids', 'manage shipping containers', 'tackle the root drivers of these challenges like inequity, like corruption', 'Migrant Protection Protocols'], 'IMPACT': ['building Mexicos crime-fighting capabilities and rule of law projects', 'significant departure from Meridas emphasis on the criminal justice system', 'fewer homicides in Mexico and less drug consumption', 'reducing trafficking of guns, provide more opportunities to youth', 'combating the causes that originate violence with social programs, intelligence and coordination', 'manage the flow of migrants to the U.S. border']}}""}"

OX124 is a nasal rescue medication for opioid overdose containing a high dose of naloxone and is the first product based on Orexo´s world-class\xa0drug delivery platform, amorphOX®. The PDUFA date is set to July 15, 2024, but recent review processes in the category indicate a risk of some delay.\r\nOX124 will meet the growing need for more powerful medications to improve the possibility of reviving individuals experiencing an overdose caused by use of synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, which today cause 91 percent of all fatal opioid overdoses.[2]\xa0OX124 is a potent medication and, in combination with rapid absorption and high bioavailability, this makes it capable of reversing an overdose or sustaining consciousness in a patient who has taken synthetic opioids. AmorphOX is an innovative powder-based technology that, in addition to rapid absorption and high bioavailability, improves stability and reduces sensitivity related to temperature changes. For users and lay-people[3]\xa0OX124 has the potential to become an efficient and reliable rescue medication independent of temperature variations during storage, for example its efficacy is not affected at freezing temperatures. OX124 is protected by patents until 2039.\r\nDriven by the need to increase access to overdose medication, low-dose products, including the market leader, have recently been approved by the FDA as non-prescription over-the-counter (OTC) products. Historically, OTC products in the US have had limited reimbursement from insurance companies and, when applying similar industry analogues going forward, this may provide an advantage to high-dose prescription naloxone products, such as OX124. In addition, high-dose prescription products are expected to benefit from the continued expansion of mandatory co-prescription of naloxone when prescribing opioids to at-risk patients suffering\xa0from pain.\r\nNikolaj Sørensen, President and CEO, said:\xa0""I am pleased the FDA can now start reviewing our rescue drug, OX124. With its high-dose of naloxone and unique formulation, OX124 has the potential to reduce the acceleration in fatal overdoses caused by the widespread misuse of synthetic opioids. We\'re approaching this launch in a rapidly growing market that\'s currently undergoing major changes, which are closely monitored by me and my commercialization team in the US. I feel confident we can take advantage of these recent developments to reach many people acutely in need of more powerful overdose rescue medications. With approval, we intend to initiate commercial activities during the second half of 2024 with a focus on obtaining reimbursement ahead of a broader launch into retail pharmacies early in 2025.""\r\nFor further information please contact:\r\nNikolaj Sørensen, President and CEO\xa0Tel: +46 (0)18\xa0780 88 00E-mail: ir@orexo.com\xa0\r\nLena\xa0Wange, IR &amp; Communications DirectorTel: +46 (0)18\xa0780 88 00E-mail: ir@orexo.com\xa0\r\nAbout Orexo\r\nOrexo is a Swedish pharmaceutical company with over 25 years of experience developing improved pharmaceuticals based on proprietary formulation technologies that meet large medical needs.

When the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the Application Guide, follow the program-specific instructions.\r\nApplications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.\r\nPurpose\r\nThe goal of this initiative is to support research that can improve public health and respond to the opioid crisis by increasing knowledge pertaining to the implementation and sustainability of prevention services. This notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) solicits applications to address understudied areas of opportunity that, if researched, could create the foundation needed to inform a prevention infrastructure for ongoing delivery and sustainment of interventions to prevent opioid and other substance misuse and use disorders.\r\nThis NOFO is a companion to RFA-DA-24-066 which also solicits applications relevant to the focus area. Applicants should note the difference between these NOFOs, RFA-DA-24-066 solicits R61/R33 phased awards, which are most appropriate for projects that require 1-2 years for preparatory work such as collecting pilot data; obtaining and integrating existing data sets; building stakeholder engagement; developing, adapting, and testing the feasibility of key components of interventions or implementation strategies; building necessary infrastructure to support a larger trial; or similar activities upon which the subsequent phase would be dependent. Phased awards do not require pilot or feasibility data at the time of submission. In contrast, this NOFO RFA-DA-24-067 solicits R01 applications that already have relevant preliminary, pilot, or feasibility data.\r\nBackground\r\nThe NIH HEAL Initiative: This NOFO is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain management. More information about the HEAL Initiative is available at:\u202fhttps://heal.nih.gov/.\r\nThe importance of prevention in combating the opioid crisis is clear – identifying and implementing effective strategies to prevent the onset of opioid misuse and use disorder can yield positive individual, societal, and financial benefits and decrease the need for treatment services. In 2020, 9.5 million people aged 12 or older reported misusing opioids in the past year (National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2021), indicating that there are millions of people whose trajectories could have been changed, had they been exposed to an effective prevention strategy. Recent HEAL-funded research suggests that some risk factors for opioid misuse tend to be similar to risks for using other substances, and initiation of other substance use (e.g., cannabis) may precede initiation of opioid use in some populations. Previous and ongoing studies have developed and are testing innovative prevention approaches to address the range of individual, social, and environmental motivations for using non-prescription opioids, relevant to and effective for diverse populations.\xa0\r\nWhile there are effective prevention strategies, those strategies may not be widely implemented in practice. One of the biggest barriers to the wide-scale implementation of opioid and other substance use prevention interventions is the lack of infrastructure at the national and state levels to support prevention service delivery. Prevention programs are often embedded in broader systems or settings (e.g., schools, justice settings, social service settings, community behavioral health centers) and are, therefore, competing with other services for time and resources. In addition to limited resources, the scope and competencies needed for a prevention workforce are not well-defined. Finally, when prevention resources exist, those allocating the funding may not have information regarding evidence-based programs and practices, and may, therefore, not require their use. This may result in state agencies distributing the small amount of federal and state funds they receive for prevention to localities with varying guidance on how it can most effectively be used.\r\nDefinition of prevention: For this NOFO, the focus is selective or indicated prevention strategies.\xa0The scope of this NOFO\xa0is services related research to inform the delivery of strategies or programs that reduce risks for substance misuse, prevent initiation, or prevent escalation to substance use disorder (SUD) among individuals who are at-risk or already misusing substances (for additional information on the definition of intervention levels see:\xa0https://nap.nationalacademies.org/resource/25552/Prevention%20Models%20-%20FINAL.pdf)\r\nResearch Objectives\r\nTo ensure existing prevention intervention research efforts have a broad public health impact, research is needed to identify pathways for effective prevention strategies to be adopted and funded for wide-scale delivery. Thus, the goal of this initiative is to support research to address service delivery related questions.\xa0Projects submitted in response to this NOFO may define research to inform the establishment of a prevention infrastructure in one of two ways –\r\n<ol><li>Research on strategies to implement and sustain evidence-based prevention services, so they are embedded within existing systems and settings (e.g., healthcare, child welfare, justice, education), facilitating the ongoing delivery of prevention services by adapting programs to setting, using natural providers and leveraging existing resources within the system or setting; OR</li><li>Research to understand how to best develop and maintain an independent prevention workforce and delivery system that the settings/systems noted above can utilize to ‘refer’ individuals or families to for the receipt of preventive services when they may be experiencing risk for opioid or other substance use.</li></ol>Example areas of research interest include, but are not limited to:\xa0 \xa0\r\n<ul><li>Developing and testing approaches to the implementation, scale-up and sustainability of effective interventions to prevent opioid and other substance misuse and use disorder, including the testing of strategies to build infrastructure and capacity to deliver prevention services within diverse systems and settings.</li><li>Research to examine scientific solutions to prevention workforce capacity challenges, including developing and testing new approaches to training and retaining prevention workforce personnel (e.g., prevention practitioners, intervention implementers), task shifting and identifying opportunities to integrate prevention service delivery into a variety of staff positions, and strategies to build centralized, community-based prevention systems and workforces.\xa0</li><li>Developing and testing innovative strategies and models for optimizing key implementation processes: identifying intervention core components, adaptation and customization, implementation fidelity, and organizational or system level strategies to enhance uptake and sustainability of evidence based preventive interventions.</li><li>Research to leverage technology and/or ‘direct to consumer’ strategies to facilitate access to preventive care – this may include increased use of smartphone\xa0/mobile technology, use of social media for intervention delivery, or other methods as appropriate.</li><li>Research to test the cost benefits/offsets and cost-effectiveness of investment in prevention infrastructure and evidence-based interventions, including broad investment and benefits at the community or population level.</li><li>Studies examining the impact of evidence-based practice registries and other decision-making tools on uptake of evidence-based interventions and the longer-term impact on preventing substance use and promoting public health.</li><li>Strategies that seek to improve quality, availability, and utility of data that can be used to track the extent of program implementation and/or receipt of services within or between systems.\xa0</li></ul>Proposed research under this NOFO must move beyond descriptive studies that simply identify factors that facilitate or impede the delivery of effective preventive services. Rather, applications should seek to develop and test systematic strategies for the implementation and sustainability of effective strategies to prevent opioid and other substance misuse and/or use disorder, and strategies to reduce risk for overdose among individuals who do not meet criteria for SUD. To ensure sustainability of service delivery strategies tested, applicants should partner with communities and localities who use existing funds (e.g., federal block grant and demonstration grants; settlement funds; private foundations) to support evidence-based prevention programs and leverage those resources as the foundation for building infrastructure. Research should be designed in such a way that there is a high probability that interventions delivered can be scaled and sustained after the study period ends.\r\nMethodology used should accelerate the translation of findings generated by the proposed research into practice. To maximize the acceptability, feasibility, scalability and sustainability of prevention services being studied, applicants\u202fmust engage relevant end users\xa0in study conceptualization, design, execution, and interpretation. For the purpose of this NOFO, end user is broadly defined and may include policymakers, state and local level decision makers, practitioners, intervention implementers, families, youth, and community members. Applications proposing to embed an intervention within a specific setting should consider\xa0the potential generalizability of the proposed service delivery model (i.e., is the model specific to the intervention and setting being tested of is it a framework that could generalize to other prevention programs and settings). Attention should be paid to health disparities and inequities and their relevance to the interventions or services being studied.\r\nThis NOFO will not accept\xa0applications that seek to develop and test the efficacy of novel prevention intervention strategies. However, in most instances an intervention will be delivered in order to evaluate the services related research question. Data on an intervention’s effectiveness may be collected in the context of evaluating the services related research questions. Research that tests adaptations to the delivery platforms of existing interventions may also be submitted through this NOFO. This NOFO will not accept\xa0overdose prevention or harm reduction strategies for individuals with SUD, but applicants may propose prevention services or infrastructure research that includes consideration for community-level risks of overdose among those at risk for initiation of use or who have initiated substance use but do not meet criteria for SUD.\r\nPre-Application Consultation\r\nPotential applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with appropriate NIH Program staff early in the application development process. This early contact will provide an opportunity to discuss and clarify NIH policies and guidelines, including the scope of the project relative to the HEAL initiative mission and intent of this NOFO.\r\nSpecial Considerations:\r\nNational Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) applicants are strongly encouraged to review the guidelines and adhere to the requirements applicable to their research listed in the\xa0Special Considerations for NIDA Funding Opportunities and Awards. Upon award, these considerations will be included in the Notice of Grant Award.\r\nApplications Not Responsive to this NOFO:\r\nThe following applications will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed:\r\n<ul><li>Applications that do not address research questions related to implementation, scale-up, or sustainability of prevention services or the development of a prevention infrastructure</li><li>Applications testing novel preventive interventions; studies examining the efficacy of a prevention program</li><li>Applications that do not involve a prevention focus, where prevention is defined as any program or strategy whose purpose is to\xa0reduce risks for substance misuse, prevent initiation, or prevent escalation to SUD among individuals who are at-risk or already misusing substances (for additional information on the definition of intervention levels see:\xa0https://nap.nationalacademies.org/resource/25552/Prevention%20Models%20-%20FINAL.pdf)</li><li>Studies focused on implementation and sustainability of SUD treatment or treatment adherence related research will not be considered under this NOFO.</li><li>Applications that do not include preliminary data, pilot or feasibility data</li><li>Applications that do not include a plan for the meaningful engagement of end users as partners in the research process.</li></ul>There are also opportunities to harmonize data within the broader NIH HEAL Initiative. Applicants selected for funding should expect to have a conversation with NIH program staff early in their project regarding high priority areas for potential harmonization.\r\nDiversity: In addition to scientific diversity, applicants should strive to incorporate diversity in their team development plan. Research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. There are many benefits that flow from a diverse NIH-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust.\xa0In spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. NIH encourages institutions to diversify their student and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences. Please refer to Notice of NIH\'s Interest in Diversity\xa0NOT-OD-20-031\xa0for more details.\xa0\r\nEngaging People with Lived Experience and Other Collaborators: People with lived experience (e.g., patients, patient advocates, caregivers, families, community leaders) have important insights that can improve meaningful outcomes, uptake of research findings, and health equity across the continuum of research from basic through implementation studies. The perspectives of other relevant collaborators (e.g., health service providers, payors, public health agencies, community-based organizations, biotech, pharma) can further improve research impact. The NIH HEAL initiative strongly encourages applicants to specify their plan for meaningful engagement of people with lived experience and other collaborators in the research process. Meaningful engagement will vary with the focus of the research but should at minimum ensure that researchers are connecting with relevant collaborators and incorporating their perspectives throughout the conception, implementation, and dissemination of the research.\xa0Meaningful engagement should address what the researchers will learn and how the people with lived experience and/or collaborators will benefit from the partnership. To promote health equity, as is relevant for the research proposed, it is recommended that at least two people with lived experience from populations who experience health disparities should be meaningfully engaged in these efforts.\xa0See this resource for more information in engaging people with lived experience:\xa0https://aspe.hhs.gov/lived-experience).\xa0\r\nPI Meeting Attendance\r\nThe NIH HEAL Initiative will require a high level of coordination and sharing between investigators. It is expected that NIH HEAL Initiative recipients will cooperate and coordinate their activities after awards are made by participating in Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) meetings, including an annual HEAL Investigators Meeting, as well as other activities.\r\nClinical Trial Accrual\xa0\r\nThis NOFO will support applications that include a series of milestones for completion of the clinical trial (if proposed) and provide contingency plans to proactively confront potential delays or disturbances in attaining the milestones. Continuation of the award is conditional upon satisfactory progress, availability of funds, and scientific priorities of the HEAL Initiative. If, at any time, recruitment falls significantly below the projected milestones for recruitment, NIH will consider ending support and negotiating an orderly phase-out of the award.

Funding Restrictions. Selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. Any costs incurred before receipt of the NoA are at the recipient\'s risk. These costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs.\r\nAny application awarded in response to this NOFO will be subject to terms and conditions found on the Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants website.\xa0 This includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website.\r\nIndividual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the NIH and are subject to the IC-specific terms and conditions identified in the NoA.\r\nClinicalTrials.gov: If an award provides for one or more clinical trials. By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the ""responsible party"" must register and submit results information for certain “applicable clinical trials” on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website (https://register.clinicaltrials.gov). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm\r\nInstitutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.\r\nData and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&amp;R) and PHS 398).\r\nInvestigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE).\r\n2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements\r\nAll NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the\xa0NIH Grants Policy Statement as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General\xa0and Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Recipients, and Activities, including of note, but not limited to:\r\nIf a recipient is successful and receives a Notice of Award, in accepting the award, the recipient agrees that any activities under the award are subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other Department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions.\r\nShould the applicant organization successfully compete for an award, recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS will be required to complete an HHS Assurance of Compliance form (HHS Assurance of Compliance form (HHS 690) in which the recipient agrees, as a condition of receiving the grant, to administer programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, sex and disability, and agreeing to comply with federal conscience laws, where applicable. This includes ensuring that entities take meaningful steps to provide meaningful access to persons with limited English proficiency; and ensuring effective communication with persons with disabilities. Where applicable, Title XI and Section 1557 prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, and gender identity, The HHS Office for Civil Rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. See https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.html.\r\nHHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this NOFO.\r\nPlease contact the HHS Office for Civil Rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html or call 1-800-368-1019 or TDD 1-800-537-7697.\r\nIn accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) requirements. FAPIIS requires Federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS) prior to making an award. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 CFR Part 75.205 and 2 CFR Part 200.206 “Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.”\r\nNot Applicable\r\n3.

"{'For the first time in U.S. history, more than 100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in a single year, health officials say. (Nov. 17)\r\nAP Domestic\r\nNew guidance on prescribing opioids unveiled today by the\xa0Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\xa0avoids the strict limits found in a 2016 version that accelerated a\xa0nationwide drop in pain pill prescriptions but led to backlash from chronic pain patients.\xa0\r\nThe 229-page document advises doctors to limit new opioid prescriptions and discuss alternative therapies with patients.\xa0But the new guidance largely avoids figures on dosage and length of prescription and warns against abruptly or rapidly discontinuing pain pills for some chronic pain patients.\r\n""We\'ve built in flexibility so that there\'s not a one-size-fits-all approach,"" said Christopher Jones, acting director of the CDC\'s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.\xa0\r\nThe document includes a dozen recommendations on how and when to manage pain patients, including non-pain pill therapies, for people in non-hospital settings. Just as important, it does not include the ""hard thresholds"" from the 2016 version that ""were essentially taken out of context beyond (their)\xa0intent and applied as rigid laws, regulations and policies,"" Jones said.\xa0\r\nThe new guidance, available for the public to review and comment on over the next 60 days,\xa0is for doctors and non-physician prescribers who treat three categories of patients:\xa0adults\xa0with acute pain lasting\xa0less than one month;\xa0""subacute"" pain for one to three months; and chronic pain for three months or longer.\xa0It does not apply to sickle cell disease, cancer,\xa0palliative or end-of-life care.\xa0\r\nFor patients who have not taken opioids before,\xa0doctors should prescribe the lowest dosage. For chronic-pain\xa0patients, prescribers should be cautious about recommending opioids and gauge the risks and benefits.\xa0\r\nDoctors and other clinicians should recommend pain pills for chronic pain\xa0patients only if expected benefits and\xa0ability to do everyday tasks outweigh known risks, which can include addiction, overdose, heart trouble, broken bones or falls.\r\nDoctors also should discuss risks and benefits and\xa0should consider how opioid prescriptions\xa0will be discontinued.\r\nFor patients already on higher dosages, clinicians should\xa0rely on other therapies and try to gradually lower dosages or\xa0discontinue opioids. However, unless there\'s a life-threatening\xa0issue such as signs of overdose, doctors should not abruptly discontinue or rapidly reduce\xa0opioid dosages, the guideline said.\r\n""They are trying to thread a needle here,"" said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a\xa0Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health vice dean for public health practice and community engagement. ""They\'re trying to balance, on the one hand,\xa0the importance of clear guidance to clinicians. And on the other, the danger it could turn into\r\na rigid policy that undermines patient care.""\r\nAfter the 2016 guideline was released, more than half of states passed laws that limited initial opioid prescriptions for acute pain to seven days or less.\xa0Many states limited pain pill fills for Medicaid enrollees, and private insurers and pharmacies also curtailed opioid prescriptions. Some states enacted strict limits on doses, prompting doctors to aggressively taper patients who had been on opioids for years, and medical boards sanctioned doctors who ran afoul of the tighter requirements.\xa0\r\nUnder the old recommendation, chronic pain sufferers complained of suddenly being cut off from pills they had taken for months or even years. Some in the middle of cancer treatments or recovering from operations could not get pain medications.\r\nFollowing the earlier guideline, a non-peer reviewed survey of more than 3000 patients\xa0found 84% reported more pain and worse quality of life and 42% said they had considered suicide.\r\nAmid backlash from chronic pain patients and their allies, federal officials said doctors were misusing the\xa02016\xa0opioid pain medication guidelines. In a 2019 paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine,\xa0the CDC said many physicians were guilty of a ""misapplication""\xa0of the 2016\xa0guideline\xa0that clamped down on the use of opioids.\r\nMore: Pain patients left in anguish by doctors \'terrified\' of opioid addiction, despite CDC change\r\nIn a nod to the earlier controversy, the new report said prescribers should avoid misapplying the new guidance\xa0and not implement policies that result in unintended consequences for patients.\r\nThe guideline warned against being inflexible on the dose and duration, doctors no longer seeing\xa0chronic pain patients or cutting back on dosages for stable patients without discussing it with them.\r\nThe report also noted disparities in care based on race and geography, with Black opioid users less likely than whites to be referred to pain specialists.\xa0And rural residents are significantly more likely to be prescribed opioids when non-opioid treatments might be preferred, the report said.\xa0\r\n\xa0""We see continued long-standing disparities in access to pain care or the types of care that might be provided, in particular among racial ethnic minority populations who often are not provided pain care at the same level,"" the CDC\'s Jones said.\xa0\r\nOpioid prescriptions began declining in 2012 and the drop accelerated after the 2016 guidance was adopted. Still, the number of overdose deaths have continued to rise as people increasingly turned to heroin\xa0and, more recently, illicitly manufactured fentanyl, often cut with street drugs such as methamphetamine.\xa0\r\nMore than 100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses during the 12 months following the COVID-19 lockdowns, the most overdose deaths ever recorded in\xa0a\xa0one-year span, according to\xa0the CDC.\r\nThe\xa0100,306 drug overdose deaths during the 12 months ending in April\xa0was a jump of 28.5% from the 78,056 deaths during the same period one year\xa0before and\xa0more than double\xa0the number of deaths each year from vehicle crashes, according to the most recent National Center for Health Statistics estimates released by the CDC in November.\r\nSome project those drug deaths will continue to rise. A\xa0study published this month in The Lancet\xa0projected 1.2 million would die from overdose deaths in the U.S. and Canada through 2029\xa0unless leaders enact evidence-based public health policies.\r\nKeith Humphreys, a Stanford University psychiatry and behavioral sciences professor who chaired a commission that published The Lancet study, said it\'s important to tailor policies to a patient\'s individual circumstances rather than adopt a blanket approach for all.\xa0\r\n""The commission absolutely did not endorse unilaterally kicking pain patients off their medication, which can cause significant harm,"" Humphreys said. ""Our focus was on evidence-based opioid stewardship, which is much more about not putting new patients on opioids in the first place"" and\xa0helping existing opioid patients\xa0taper to lower doses.\r\nMore: Drug overdoses surged amid COVID lockdowns; more deaths in one year than ever before\r\nThe Biden administration has sought to curb the addiction\xa0crisis with a four-part strategy\xa0that aims to slow the nation\'s spiraling\xa0overdose deaths.\r\nThe plan seeks to prevent substance-use\xa0disorder, expand medication-assisted treatment for people with opioid addiction\xa0and\xa0support people in recovery from addiction.\xa0The plan\xa0also\xa0make\xa0the opioid overdose-reversal drug naloxone widely available, expand\xa0access to test strips that can detect fentanyl, and support\xa0programs that supply clean needles to prevent the transmission of HIV and hepatitis C.\xa0\r\nKen Alltucker is on Twitter as\xa0@kalltucker\xa0or can be emailed at\xa0alltuck@usatoday.com.\r\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2022/02/10/cdcs-opioid-prescribing-guide-differs-new-existing-pain-sufferers/6719364001/': ""{'PERSON': ['Christopher Jones', 'Joshua Sharfstein', 'Keith Humphreys', 'Ken Alltucker'], 'DATE': ['Nov. 17', '60 days', '2016', '2019', '2012', '12 months', 'April', 'one year', '2029'], 'LOC': ['U.S.', 'public health practice and community engagement'], 'ORG': ['Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'CDC', 'National Center for Injury Prevention and Control', 'Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health', 'New England Journal of Medicine', 'National Center for Health Statistics', 'Stanford University', 'The Lancet'], 'PROGRAMS': ['nationwide drop in pain pill prescriptions', 'new guidance', 'prescribing opioids', 'new patients on opioids', 'opioid stewardship', 'four-part strategy', 'prevent substance-use disorder'], 'IMPACT': ['more than 100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in a single year', '84% reported more pain and worse quality of life', '42% said they had considered suicide', 'disparities in access to pain care', 'number of overdose deaths have continued to rise', '100,306 drug overdose deaths', '1.2 million would die from overdose deaths']}}""}"

When the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the Application Guide, follow the program-specific instructions.\r\nApplications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.\r\nPurpose\r\nThe goal of this initiative is to support research that can improve public health and respond to the opioid crisis by increasing knowledge pertaining to the delivery and sustainability of prevention services. This notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) solicits applications to address understudied areas of opportunity that, if researched, could create the foundation needed to inform a prevention infrastructure for ongoing delivery and sustainment of interventions to prevent opioid and other substance misuse and use disorders.\r\nThis NOFO is a companion to RFA-DA-24-067 which also solicits applications relevant to the focus area. Applicants should note the difference between these NOFOs. This NOFO,\xa0RFA-DA-24-066 solicits phased awards, which are most appropriate for projects that require 1-2 years for preparatory work such as collecting pilot data; obtaining and integrating existing data sets; building stakeholder engagement; developing, adapting, and testing the feasibility of key components of implementation strategies; building necessary infrastructure to support a larger trial; or similar activities upon which the subsequent phase would be dependent. Phased awards do not require pilot or feasibility data at the time of submission. Awards made under this NOFO\xa0may transition to the second (R33) phase to conduct a larger study upon successfully meeting relevant milestones in the R61 phase. In contrast, RFA-DA-24-067 solicits R01 applications that already have relevant preliminary, pilot, or feasibility data.\r\nBackground\r\nThe NIH HEAL Initiative: This NOFO is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain management. More information about the HEAL Initiative is available at:\u202fhttps://heal.nih.gov/.\r\nThe importance of prevention in combating the opioid crisis is clear – identifying and implementing effective strategies to prevent the onset of opioid misuse and use disorder can yield\xa0positive individual, societal, and financial benefits and decrease the need for treatment services. In 2020, 9.5 million people aged 12 or older reported misusing opioids in the past year (National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2021), indicating that there are millions of people whose trajectories could have been changed, had they been exposed to an effective prevention strategy. Recent HEAL-funded research suggests that some risk factors for opioid misuse tend to be similar to risks for using other substances, and initiation of other substance use (e.g., cannabis) may precede initiation of opioid use in some populations. Previous and ongoing studies have developed and are testing innovative prevention approaches to address the range of individual, social, and environmental motivations for using non-prescription opioids, relevant to and effective for diverse populations.\xa0\r\nWhile there are effective prevention strategies, those strategies may not be widely implemented in practice. One of the biggest barriers to the wide-scale implementation of opioid and other substance use prevention interventions is the lack of infrastructure at the national and state levels to support prevention service delivery. Prevention programs are often embedded in broader systems or settings (e.g., schools, justice settings, social service settings, community behavioral health centers) and, therefore, may be competing with other services for time and resources. In addition to limited resources, the scope and competencies needed for a prevention workforce are not well-defined. Finally, when prevention resources exist, those allocating the funding may not have information regarding evidence-based programs and practices, and therefore they may not require their use. This may result in state agencies distributing the small amount of federal and state funds they receive for prevention to localities with varying guidance on how it can most effectively be used.\r\nDefinition of prevention: For this NOFO, the focus is selective or indicated prevention strategies.\xa0The scope of this NOFO\xa0is services related research to inform the delivery of strategies or programs that reduce risks for substance misuse, prevent initiation, or prevent escalation to substance use disorder (SUD) among individuals who are at-risk or already misusing substances (for additional information on the definition of intervention levels see:\xa0https://nap.nationalacademies.org/resource/25552/Prevention%20Models%20-%20FINAL.pdf)\r\nResearch Objectives\r\nTo ensure existing prevention intervention research efforts have a broad public health impact, research is needed to identify pathways for effective prevention strategies to be adopted and funded for wide-scale delivery. Thus, the goal of this initiative is to support research to address service delivery related questions.\xa0Projects submitted in response to this NOFO may define research to inform the establishment of a prevention infrastructure in one of two ways –\r\n<ol><li>Research on strategies to implement and sustain evidence-based prevention services, so they are embedded within existing systems and settings (e.g., healthcare, child welfare, justice, education), facilitating the ongoing delivery of prevention services by adapting programs to setting, using natural providers and leveraging existing resources within the system or setting; OR</li><li>Research to understand how to best develop and maintain an independent prevention workforce and delivery system that the settings/systems noted above can utilize to ‘refer’ individuals or families to for the receipt of preventive services when they may be experiencing risk for opioid or other substance use.</li></ol>Example areas of research interest include, but are not limited to:\xa0 \xa0\r\n<ul><li>Developing and testing approaches to the implementation, sustainability and scale-up of effective interventions to prevent opioid and other substance misuse and use disorder, including the testing of strategies to build infrastructure and capacity to deliver prevention services within diverse systems and settings.</li><li>Research to examine scientific solutions to prevention workforce capacity challenges, including developing and testing new approaches to training and retaining prevention workforce personnel (e.g., prevention practitioners, intervention implementers), task shifting and identifying opportunities to integrate prevention service delivery into a variety of staff positions, and strategies to build centralized, community-based prevention systems and workforces.\xa0</li><li>Developing and testing innovative strategies and models for optimizing key implementation processes: identifying intervention core components, adaptation and customization, implementation fidelity, and organizational or system level strategies to enhance uptake and sustainability of evidence based preventive interventions.</li><li>Research to leverage technology and/or direct to consumer\'s strategies to facilitate access to preventive care – this may include increased use of smartphone\xa0/mobile technology, use of social media for intervention delivery, or other methods as appropriate.</li><li>Research to test the cost benefits/offsets and cost effectiveness of investment in prevention infrastructure and evidence-based interventions, including broad investment and benefits at the community or population level.</li><li>Studies examining the impact of evidence-based practice registries and other decision-making tools on uptake of evidence-based interventions and the longer-term impact on preventing substance use and promoting public health.</li><li>Strategies that seek to improve quality, availability, and utility of data that can be used to track the extent of program implementation and/or receipt of services within or between systems.\xa0</li></ul>Proposed research under this NOFO must move beyond descriptive studies that simply identify factors that facilitate or impede the delivery of effective preventive services. Rather, applications should seek to develop and test systematic strategies for the implementation and sustainability of effective strategies to prevent opioid and other substance misuse and/or use disorder, and strategies to reduce risk for overdose among individuals who do not meet the criteria for SUD. To ensure sustainability of service delivery strategies tested, applicants should partner with communities and localities who use existing funds (e.g., federal block grant and demonstration grants; settlement funds; private foundations) to support evidence-based prevention programs and leverage those resources as the foundation for building infrastructure. Research should be designed in such a way that there is a high probability that interventions delivered can be scaled and sustained after the study period ends.\r\nMethodology used should accelerate the translation of findings generated by the proposed research into practice. To maximize the acceptability, feasibility, scalability and sustainability of prevention services being studied, applicants\u202fmust engage relevant end users\xa0in study conceptualization, design, execution, and interpretation. For the purpose of this NOFO, end user is broadly defined and may include policymakers, state and local level decision makers, practitioners, intervention implementers, families, youth, and community members. Applications proposing to embed an intervention within a specific setting should consider\xa0the potential generalizability of the proposed service delivery model (i.e., is the model specific to the intervention and setting being tested or is it a framework that could generalize to other prevention programs and settings). Attention should be paid to health disparities and inequities and their relevance to the interventions or services being studied.\r\nThis NOFO will not accept\xa0applications that seek to develop and test the efficacy of novel prevention intervention strategies. However, in most instances an intervention will be delivered in order to evaluate the services related research question. Data on an intervention’s effectiveness may be collected in the context of evaluating the services related research questions. Research that tests adaptations to the delivery platforms of existing interventions may also be submitted through this NOFO. This NOFO will not support overdose prevention or harm reduction strategies for individuals with SUD, but applicants may propose prevention services or infrastructure research that includes consideration for community-level risks of overdose among those at risk for initiation of use or who have initiated substance use but do not meet criteria for SUD.\r\nPhases of the Award &amp; Milestones\r\nThis funding opportunity uses a R61/R33 Exploratory/Developmental Phased Award mechanism. Support will be provided for up to 6 years, which includes initial support of up to 2 years of the R61 phase, followed by up to 5 years of support for the R33 phase upon successfully meeting R61 milestones.\r\nThis mechanism is provided to facilitate research for which preliminary data is not available, including high risk/high reward research. However, even for high risk/high reward research, applicants must provide a clear vision for how the research would progress if successful. The R61 phase is a planning phase that will support activities that demonstrate feasibility. It is expected that work during this phase will largely focus on issues related to (1) collecting feasibility or pilot data for a clinical trial, (2) stakeholder engagement to ensure support, sustainability, scalability, etc.; (3) testing hypotheses for which preliminary data is not otherwise available; or (4) demonstrating ability to build necessary infrastructure. Applications must delineate milestones that signify the completion of major elements that demonstrate readiness to proceed to a larger scale project in the second phase (e.g., successful piloting of an intervention or intervention component; accessing or improving timeliness of a specific dataset; establishing Memoranda of Understanding [MOU] with key stakeholders, etc.). See Part 2. Section IV “Other Project Information” below for instructions on submission of the milestone plan.\r\nFor transition to the R33 phase, awardees must submit the transition package at least\xa075 days prior to the anticipated start date of\xa0the R33 phase. The transition plan should include the R61 progress report describing in detail the progress towards the R61 milestones and a description of how research proposed for the R33 phase will be supported by the completion of the R61 phase milestones. These materials will be evaluated by NIH program staff to determine if the milestones were met.\r\nTransition to the R33 phases requires administrative review by NIH staff and is not guaranteed. R33 funding decisions will be based on the original R61/R33 peer review recommendations, successful completion of transition milestones, any proposed changes to the R33 research based on R61 findings, program priorities, and availability of funds. It is not expected that all applications will continue to the R33 phase.\r\nPre-Application Consultation\r\nPotential applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with appropriate NIH Program staff early in the application development process. This early contact will provide an opportunity to discuss and clarify NIH policies and guidelines, including the scope of the project relative to the HEAL initiative mission and the intent of this NOFO.\r\nSpecial Considerations:\r\nNational Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) applicants are strongly encouraged to review the guidelines and adhere to the requirements applicable to their research listed in the\xa0Special Considerations for NIDA Funding Opportunities and Awards. Upon award, these considerations will be included in the Notice of Grant Award.\r\nApplications Not Responsive to this NOFO:\r\nThe following applications will be considered non-responsive and will not be reviewed:\r\n<ul><li>Applications that do not address research questions related to implementation, sustainability or scale-up of prevention services or the development of a prevention infrastructure</li><li>Applications testing novel preventive interventions; studies examining the efficacy of a prevention program</li><li>Applications that do not involve a prevention focus, where prevention is defined as any program or strategy whose purpose is to\xa0reduce risks for substance misuse, prevent initiation, or prevent escalation to SUD\xa0among individuals who are at-risk or already misusing substances (for additional information on the definition of intervention levels see:\xa0https://nap.nationalacademies.org/resource/25552/Prevention%20Models%20-%20FINAL.pdf).</li><li>Studies focused on sustainability and implementation of SUD treatment or treatment adherence related research will not be considered under this NOFO.</li><li>Applications that do not include a plan for the meaningful engagement of end users as partners in the research process.</li><li>Applications that do not include a Milestone\xa0Plan (see\xa0Part 2. Section IV “Other Project Information” below for instructions on submission of the milestone plan)</li></ul>There are also opportunities to harmonize data within the broader NIH HEAL Initiative. Applicants selected for funding should expect to have a conversation with NIH program staff early in their project regarding high priority areas for potential harmonization.\r\nDiversity: In addition to scientific diversity, applicants should strive to incorporate diversity in their team development plan. Research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogeneous teams. Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. There are many benefits that flow from a diverse NIH-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in, and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust.\xa0In spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. NIH encourages institutions to diversify their student and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences. Please refer to Notice of NIH\'s Interest in Diversity\xa0NOT-OD-20-031\xa0for more details.\xa0\r\nEngaging People with Lived Experience and Other Collaborators: People with lived experience (e.g., patients, patient advocates, caregivers, families, community leaders) have important insights that can improve meaningful outcomes, uptake of research findings, and health equity across the continuum of research from basic through implementation studies. The perspectives of other relevant collaborators (e.g., health service providers, payors, public health agencies, community-based organizations, biotech, Pharma) can further improve research impact. The NIH HEAL initiative strongly encourages applicants to specify their plan for meaningful engagement of people with lived experience and other collaborators in the research process. Meaningful engagement will vary with the focus of the research but should at minimum ensure that researchers are connecting with relevant collaborators and incorporating their perspectives throughout the conception, implementation, and dissemination of the research.\xa0Meaningful engagement should address what the researchers will learn and how the people with lived experience and/or collaborators will benefit from the partnership. To promote health equity, as is relevant for the research proposed, it is recommended that at least two people with lived experience from populations who experience health disparities should be meaningfully engaged in these efforts \xa0.\xa0See this resource for more information in engaging people with lived experience:\xa0https://aspe.hhs.gov/lived-experience).\xa0\r\nPI Meeting Attendance\r\nThe NIH HEAL Initiative will require a high level of coordination and sharing between investigators. It is expected that NIH HEAL Initiative awardees will cooperate and coordinate their activities after awards are made by participating in Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) meetings, including an annual HEAL Investigators Meeting, as well as other activities.\r\nClinical Trial Accrual\xa0\r\nThis NOFO will support applications that include a series of milestones for completion of the clinical trial (if proposed) and provide contingency plans to proactively confront potential delays or disturbances in attaining the milestones. Continuation of the award is conditional upon satisfactory progress, availability of funds, and scientific priorities of the HEAL Initiative. If, at any time, recruitment falls significantly below the projected milestones for recruitment, NIH will consider ending support and negotiating an orderly phase-out of the award. NIH retains the option of periodic external peer review of progress. NIH program staff will closely monitor progress at all stages for milestones, accrual, and safety.\xa0\r\nSee Section VIII. Other Information for award authorities and regulations.\r\nInvestigators proposing NIH-defined clinical trials may refer to the Research Methods Resources website for information about developing statistical methods and study designs.\r\nGrant: A support mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.\r\nApplication Types Allowed \r\nNew\r\nResubmission\r\nRevision\r\nThe\xa0OER Glossary\xa0and the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide provide details on these application types. Only those application types listed here are allowed for this NOFO.\r\nOptional: Accepting applications that either propose or do not propose clinical trial(s).\r\nFunds Available and Anticipated Number of Awards \r\nThe NIH HEAL Initiative intends to commit an estimated total of $4,650,000\xa0in FY2024 for this NOFO and the companion NOFO, RFA-DA-24-067, pending availability of funds and receipt of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.\r\nApplication budgets are not limited but need to reflect the actual needs of the proposed project. Unless well-justified, it is strongly recommended that applicants not request a budget of more than $300,000 in direct costs per year for the R61 phase and $750,000 in direct costs per year for the R33 phase of the project.\xa0\r\nThe scope of the project should determine the project period for each phase. The maximum period of the combined R61 and R33 phases is 6 years, with a maximum of 2 years for the R61 phase and maximum of 5 years for the R33 phase of the project. Applicants are encouraged to streamline the project period to complete the research as efficiently as possible.It is recommended that the R33 phase not exceed 4 years unless exceptionally well justified.\r\nNIH grants policies as described in the NIH Grants Policy Statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made from this NOFO.\r\n1.

Content and Form of Application Submission\r\nIt is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the Research (R) Instructions in the\xa0How to Apply - Application Guide\xa0except where instructed in this notice of funding opportunity to do otherwise. Conformance to the requirements in the Application Guide is required and strictly enforced. Applications that are out of compliance with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.\r\nLetter of Intent\r\nAlthough a letter of intent is not required, is not binding, and does not enter into the review of a subsequent application, the information that it contains allows IC staff to estimate the potential review workload and plan the review.\r\nBy the date listed in Part 1. Overview Information, prospective applicants are asked to submit a letter of intent that includes the following information:\r\n<ul><li>Descriptive title of proposed activity</li><li>Name(s), address(es), and telephone number(s) of the PD(s)/PI(s)</li><li>Names of other key personnel</li><li>Participating institution(s)</li><li>Number and title of this funding opportunity</li></ul>The letter of intent should be sent to:\xa0NIDALetterofIntent@mail.nih.gov\r\nAll page limitations described in the SF424 Application Guide and the Table of Page Limits must be followed.\r\nThe following section supplements the instructions found in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide and should be used for preparing an application to this NOFO.\r\nAll instructions in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide must be followed.\r\nAll instructions in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide must be followed.\r\nAll instructions in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide must be followed, with the following additional instructions:\xa0\r\nTimeline &amp; Milestone Plan (Required - 2 page maximum)\r\nApplicants must include an Other Attachment entitled “Timeline and Milestone Plan,” clearly specifying proposed milestones and when those milestones are expected to be achieved. Milestones should be specific, quantifiable, and scientifically justified; they should establish the feasibility or empirical basis for pursuing the R33 phase of the study. Milestones should not simply be a restatement of the specific aims for the R61 phase. For applications where there is no preliminary data or where new partnerships are proposed, applicants should be especially attentive to proposing milestones that will help establish the feasibility of their proposed R33 project.\r\nExamples of Milestones for the R61 Phase:\r\n<ul><li>Fully executed MOUs, letters of support, and data sharing agreements, as relevant to the goals of the study, from partnering departments, agencies or stakeholders</li><li>Demonstration of active engagement and partnership with key entities and stakeholders \xa0</li><li>If preliminary data was not included in original application, preliminary data demonstrating feasibility of R33 phase must be included.</li></ul>\r\nAll instructions in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide must be followed.\r\nR&amp;R Budget\r\nAll instructions in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide must be followed, with the following additional instructions:\xa0\r\nHEAL Investigators’ Meeting:\xa0For budgeting purposes, include travel costs to support the attendance of one PD/PI (one person) at a 2-day, in-person HEAL Investigators meeting in the Washington DC area, annually for the duration of the award.\r\nAdditionally, NIH program staff may wish to periodically convene award recipients\xa0under this program, both virtually and in person. To plan for potential in-person meetings, budgets should include funds for travel for up to three\xa0people to participate in a 2-day meeting in the Washington DC every other year, beginning with the first year of award.\r\nR&amp;R Subaward Budget\r\nAll instructions in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide must be followed.\r\nAll instructions in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide must be followed.\r\nAll instructions in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide must be followed, with the following additional instructions:\r\nSpecific Aims:\r\nIn the single page attachment allowed for the specific aims, applicants should provide an overview of the overarching research question of interest as well as include clearly marked headers for “R61 Specific Aims” and “R33 Specific Aims” with brief descriptions of the aims specific to each phase of the study.\r\nResearch Strategy:\r\nThe Research Strategy should present an overview of the state of the science, current status and relevance of the proposed activities, and consideration of long-term sustainability and scalability of the proposed efforts.\r\nThe following criteria should be addressed:\r\nSignificance:\r\nThe R61 and R33 should coherently address a single set of research questions and goals, with the R61 phase establishing feasibility and necessary data to support transition to the R33 phase. Given this tight integration, only one Significance section is needed.\r\nInnovation:\r\n Only one Innovation section is needed. The Innovation section should explain how the proposed project, if successful, would lead to innovations that could help accelerate the dissemination, implementation and sustainability of prevention services and/or inform the development of an infrastructure thought which prevention services could be implemented.\r\nApproach:\r\nThe application should contain two approach sections, one for each phase as described below. It is not necessary to repeat any information or details in the R33 section that are described in the R61 section. Applications\xa0must also include a Timeline &amp; Milestone plan\r\n\xa0as an attachment as described in the SF424(R&amp;R) Other Project Information. Preliminary data is\xa0not\r\n\xa0required,\xa0nor\r\n\xa0is it required that teams have worked together previously. The phased award approach allows for earlier stage high risk/high reward projects. Applications without preliminary data should have a strong scientific premise and establish a strong rationale for how solving the challenges outlined in the application would improve the delivery of prevention intervention services.\r\nThe approach section must address the following elements in the phase most appropriate to the proposed study:\r\n<ul><li>Discussion of methodology selected; methods may include implementation science, hybrid implementation/effectiveness studies, and dissemination research designs.</li><li>A strategy for the meaningful engagement of relevant end users (e.g.,\xa0policymakers, state and local level decision makers, practitioners, intervention implementers, families, youth, and community members)\xa0as partners, and plans for utilizing their expertise and perspectives.\xa0</li><li>Discussion of the sustainability of the proposed service delivery model with respect to funding and staffing should it prove to be successful; this may include a plan for how the services may be sustained or scaled after the study period ends.</li><li>Considerations relevant to the potential generalizability of the proposed service delivery model, i.e., discussion of the model’s specificity to the selected intervention/prevention program and setting versus a framework that could be adapted for other programs and settings.\xa0</li><li>Strategies for addressing health disparities and inequities and the relevance to the interventions or services being studied.\xa0</li></ul>R61 Approach:\r\n\xa0The focus of the R61 phase is the pilot/foundational work needed to inform the larger study proposed in the R33. The R61 Approach section application should detail the strategies that will be taken in order to meet the milestones proposed in order to transition to the R33 phase.\r\nR33 Approach\r\nAlthough the Research Strategy for the R33 Phase is expected to be broad and flexible due to the nature of the exploratory research in the R61 Phase, the research strategy for the R33 phase of the award should be described in enough detail for reviewers to evaluate the merit of this component of the application, based on anticipated results.\r\nThe R33 phase may include a clinical trial if appropriate for the research questions and study design.

"{'Three years ago, while the nation’s attention was on the 2020 presidential election, voters in Oregon took a dramatic step back from America’s long-running War on Drugs. By a 17-point margin, Oregonians approved Ballot Measure 110, which eliminated criminal penalties for possessing small amounts of any drug, including cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine. When the policy went into effect early the next year, it lifted the fear of prosecution for the state’s drug users and launched Oregon on an experiment to determine whether a long-sought goal of the drug-policy reform movement—decriminalization—could help solve America’s drug problems.Early results of this reform effort, the first of its kind in any state, are now coming into view, and so far, they are not encouraging. State leaders have acknowledged faults with the policy’s implementation and enforcement measures. And Oregon’s drug problems have not improved. Last year, the state experienced one of the sharpest rises in overdose deaths in the nation and had one of the highest percentages of adults with a substance-use disorder. During one two-week period last month, three children under the age of 4 overdosed in Portland after ingesting fentanyl.For decades, drug policy in America centered on using law enforcement to target people who sold, possessed, or used drugs—an approach long supported by both Democratic and Republican politicians. Only in recent years, amid an epidemic of opioid overdoses and a national reconsideration of racial inequities in the criminal-justice system, has the drug-policy status quo begun to break down, as a coalition of health workers, criminal-justice-reform advocates, and drug-user activists have lobbied for a more compassionate and nuanced response. The new approach emphasizes reducing overdoses, stopping the spread of infectious disease, and providing drug users with the resources they need—counseling, housing, transportation—to stabilize their lives and gain control over their drug use.Oregon’s Measure 110 was viewed as an opportunity to prove that activists’ most groundbreaking idea—sharply reducing the role of law enforcement in the government’s response to drugs—could work. The measure also earmarked hundreds of millions of dollars in cannabis tax revenue for building a statewide treatment network that advocates promised would do what police and prosecutors couldn’t: help drug users stop or reduce their drug use and become healthy, engaged members of their communities. The day after the measure passed, Kassandra Frederique, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, one of the nation’s most prominent drug-policy reform organizations, issued a statement calling the vote a “historic, paradigm-shifting win” and predicting that Oregon would become “a model and starting point for states across the country to decriminalize drug use.”[Sam Quinones: America’s approach to addiction has gone off the rails]But three years later, with rising overdoses and delays in treatment funding, even some of the measure’s supporters now believe that the policy needs to be changed. In a nonpartisan statewide poll earlier this year, more than 60 percent of respondents blamed Measure 110 for making drug addiction, homelessness, and crime worse. A majority, including a majority of Democrats, said they supported bringing back criminal penalties for drug possession. This year’s legislative session, which ended in late June, saw at least a dozen Measure 110–related proposals from Democrats and Republicans alike, ranging from technical fixes to full restoration of criminal penalties for drug possession. Two significant changes—tighter restrictions on fentanyl and more state oversight of how Measure 110 funding is distributed—passed with bipartisan support.Few people consider Measure 110 “a success out of the gate,” Tony Morse, the policy and advocacy director for Oregon Recovers, told me. The organization, which promotes policy solutions to the state’s addiction crisis, initially opposed Measure 110; now it supports funding the policy, though it also wants more state money for in-patient treatment and detox services. As Morse put it, “If you take away the criminal-justice system as a pathway that gets people into treatment, you need to think about what is going to replace it.”Many advocates say the new policy simply needs more time to prove itself, even if they also acknowledge that parts of the ballot measure had flaws; advocates worked closely with lawmakers on the oversight bill that passed last month. “We’re building the plane as we fly it,” Haven Wheelock, a program supervisor at a homeless-services provider in Portland who helped put Measure 110 on the ballot, told me. “We tried the War on Drugs for 50 years, and it didn’t work … It hurts my heart every time someone says we need to repeal this before we even give it a chance.”\nWorkers from the organization Central City Concern hand out Narcan in Portland, Oregon, on April 5. (Jordan Gale)\r\n\nMeasure 110 went into effect at a time of dramatic change in U.S. drug policy. Departing from precedent, the Biden administration has endorsed and increased federal funding for a public-health strategy called harm reduction; rather than pushing for abstinence, harm reduction emphasizes keeping drug users safe—for instance, through the distribution of clean syringes and overdose-reversal medications. The term harm reduction appeared five times in the ballot text of Measure 110, which forbids funding recipients from “mandating abstinence.”Matt Sutton, the director of external relations for the Drug Policy Alliance, which helped write Measure 110 and spent more than $5 million to pass it, told me that reform advocates viewed the measure as the start of a nationwide decriminalization push. The effort started in Oregon because the state had been an early adopter of marijuana legalization and is considered a drug-policy-reform leader. Success would mean showing the rest of the country that “people did think we should invest in a public-health approach instead of criminalization,” Sutton said.To achieve this goal, Measure 110 enacted two major changes to Oregon’s drug laws. First, minor drug possession was downgraded from a misdemeanor to a violation, similar to a traffic ticket. Under the new law, users caught with up to 1 gram of heroin or methamphetamine, or up to 40 oxycodone pills, are charged a $100 fine, which can be waived if they call a treatment-referral hotline. (Selling, trafficking, and possessing large amounts of drugs remain criminal offenses in Oregon.) Second, the law set aside a portion of state cannabis tax revenue every two years to fund a statewide network of harm-reduction and other services. A grant-making panel was created to oversee the funding process. At least six members of the panel were required to be directly involved in providing services to drug users; at least two had to be active or former drug users themselves; and three were to be “members of communities that have been disproportionately impacted” by drug criminalization, according to the ballot measure.Backers of Measure 110 said the law was modeled on drug policies in Portugal, where personal drug possession was decriminalized two decades ago. But Oregon’s enforcement-and-treatment-referral system differs from Portugal’s. Users caught with drugs in Portugal are referred to a civil commission that evaluates their drug use and recommends treatment if needed, with civil sanctions for noncompliance. Portugal’s state-run health system also funds a nationwide network of treatment services, many of which focus on sobriety. Sutton said drafters of Measure 110 wanted to avoid anything that might resemble a criminal tribunal or coercing drug users into treatment. “People respond best when they’re ready to access those services in a voluntary way,” he said.Almost immediately after taking effect, Measure 110 encountered problems. A state audit published this year found that the new law was “vague” about how state officials should oversee the awarding of money to new treatment programs, and set “unrealistic timelines” for evaluating and funding treatment proposals. As a result, the funding process was left largely to the grant-making panel, most of whose members “lacked experience in designing, evaluating and administrating a governmental-grant-application process,” according to the audit. Last year, supporters of Measure 110 accused state health officials, preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic, of giving the panel insufficient direction and resources to handle a flood of grant applications. The state health authority acknowledged missteps in the grant-making process.The audit described a chaotic process, with more than a dozen canceled meetings, potential conflicts of interest in the selection of funding recipients, and lines of applicant evaluations left blank. Full distribution of the first biennial payout of cannabis tax revenue—$302 million for harm reduction, housing, and other services—did not occur until late 2022, almost two years after Measure 110 passed. Figures released by the state last month show that, in the second half of 2022, recipients of Measure 110 funding provided some form of service to roughly 50,000 “clients,” though the Oregon Health Authority has said that a single individual could be counted multiple times in that total. (A study released last year by public-health researchers in Oregon found that, as of 2020, more than 650,000 Oregonians required, but were not receiving, treatment for a substance-use disorder.)[From the May 2020 issue: America’s other epidemic]Meanwhile, the new law’s enforcement provisions have proved ineffectual. Of 5,299 drug-possession cases filed in Oregon circuit courts since Measure 110 went into effect, 3,381 resulted in a recipient failing to pay the fine or appear in court and facing no further penalties, according to the Oregon Judicial Department; about 1,300 tickets were dismissed or are pending. The state audit found that, during its first 15 months in operation, the treatment-referral hotline received just 119 calls, at a cost to the state of $7,000 per call. A survey of law-enforcement officers conducted by researchers at Portland State University found that, as of July 2022, officers were issuing an average of just 300 drug-possession tickets a month statewide, compared with 600 drug-possession arrests a month before Measure 110 took effect and close to 1,200 monthly arrests prior to the outbreak of COVID-19.“Focusing on these tickets even though they’ll be ineffective—it’s not a great use of your resources,” Sheriff Nate Sickler of Jackson County, in the rural southern part of the state, told me of his department’s approach.Advocates have celebrated a plunge in arrests. “For reducing arrests of people of color, it’s been an overwhelming success,” says Mike Marshall, the director of Oregon Recovers. But critics say that sidelining law enforcement has made it harder to persuade some drug users to stop using. Sickler cited the example of drug-court programs, which multiple studies have shown to be highly effective, including in Jackson County. Use of such programs in the county has declined in the absence of criminal prosecution, Sickler said: “Without accountability or the ability to drive a better choice, these individuals are left to their own demise.”The consequences of Measure 110’s shortcomings have fallen most heavily on Oregon’s drug users. In the two years after the law took effect, the number of annual overdoses in the state rose by 61 percent, compared with a 13 percent increase nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In neighboring Idaho and California, where drug possession remains subject to prosecution, the rate of increase was significantly lower than Oregon’s. (The spike in Washington State was similar to Oregon’s, but that comparison is more complicated because Washington’s drug policy has fluctuated since 2021.) Other states once notorious for drug deaths, including West Virginia, Indiana, and Arkansas, are now experiencing declines in overdose rates.In downtown Portland this spring, police cleared out what The Oregonian called an “open-air drug market” in a former retail center. Prominent businesses in the area, including the outdoor-gear retailer REI, have closed in recent months, in part citing a rise in shoplifting and violence. Earlier this year, Portland business owners appeared before the Multnomah County Commission to ask for help with crime, drug-dealing, and other problems stemming from a behavioral-health resource center operated by a harm-reduction nonprofit that was awarded more than $4 million in Measure 110 funding. In April, the center abruptly closed following employee complaints that clients were covering walls with graffiti and overdosing on-site. A subsequent investigation by the nonprofit found that a security contractor had been using cocaine on the job. The center reopened two weeks later with beefed-up security measures.Portland’s Democratic mayor, Ted Wheeler, went so far as to attempt an end run around Measure 110 in his city. Last month, Wheeler unveiled a proposal to criminalize public drug consumption in Portland, similar to existing bans on open-air drinking, saying in a statement that Measure 110 “is not working as it was intended to.” He added, “Portland’s substance-abuse problems have exploded to deadly and disastrous proportions.” Wheeler withdrew the proposal days later after learning that an older state law prohibits local jurisdictions from banning public drug use.Despite shifting public opinion on Measure 110, many Oregon leaders are not ready to give up on the policy. Earlier this month, Oregon Governor Tina Kotek signed legislation that strengthens state oversight of Measure 110 and requires an audit, due no later than December 2025, of about two dozen aspects of the measure’s performance, including whether it is reducing overdoses. Other bills passed by the legislature’s Democratic majority strengthened criminal penalties for possession of large quantities of fentanyl and mandated that school drug-prevention programs instruct students about the risks of synthetic opioids. Republican proposals to repeal Measure 110 outright or claw back tens of millions of dollars in harm-reduction funding were not enacted.The fallout from Measure 110 has received some critical coverage from media outlets on the right. “It is predictable,” a scholar from the Hudson Institute told Fox News. “It is a tragedy and a self-inflicted wound.” (Meanwhile, in Portugal, the model for Oregon, some residents are raising questions about their own nation’s decriminalization policy.) But so far Oregon’s experience doesn’t appear to have stopped efforts to bring decriminalization to other parts of the United States. “We’ll see more ballot initiatives,” Sutton, of the Drug Policy Alliance, said, adding that advocates are currently working with city leaders to decriminalize drugs in Washington, D.C.[Read: An anti-overdose drug is getting stronger. Maybe that’s a bad thing?]Supporters of Measure 110 are now seeking to draw attention to what they say are the policy’s overlooked positive effects. This summer, the Health Justice Recovery Alliance, a Measure 110 advocacy organization, is leading an effort to spotlight expanded treatment services and boost community awareness of the treatment-referral hotline. Advocates are also coordinating with law-enforcement agencies to ensure that officers know about local resources for drug users. “People are hiring for their programs; outreach programs are expanding, offering more services,” Devon Downeysmith, the communications director for the group, told me.An array of services around the state have been expanded through the policy: housing for pregnant women awaiting drug treatment; culturally specific programs for Black, Latino, and Indigenous drug users; and even distribution of bicycle helmets to people unable to drive to treatment meetings. “People often forget how much time it takes to spend a bunch of money and build services,” said Wheelock, the homeless-services worker, whose organization received more than $2 million in funding from Measure 110.Still, even some recipients of Measure 110 funding wonder whether one of the law’s pillars—the citation system that was supposed to help route drug users into treatment—needs to be rethought. “Perhaps some consequences might be a helpful thing,” says Julia Pinsky, a co-founder of Max’s Mission, a harm-reduction nonprofit in southern Oregon. Max’s Mission has received $1.5 million from Measure 110, enabling the organization to hire new staff, open new offices, and serve more people. Pinsky told me she is proud of her organization’s work and remains committed to the idea that “you shouldn’t have to go to prison to be treated for substance use.” She said that she doesn’t want drug use to “become a felony,” but that some people aren’t capable of stopping drug use on their own. “They need additional help.”Brandi Fogle, a regional manager for Max’s Mission, says her own story illustrates the complex trade-offs involved in reforming drug policy. Three and a half years ago, she was a homeless drug user, addicted to heroin and drifting around Jackson and Josephine Counties. Although she tried to stop numerous times, including one six-month period during which she was prescribed the drug-replacement medication methadone, she told me that a 2020 arrest for drug possession was what finally turned her life around. She asked to be enrolled in a 19-month drug-court program that included residential treatment, mandatory 12-step meetings, and a community-service project, and ultimately was hired by Pinsky.Since Measure 110 went into effect, Fogle said, she has gotten pushback from members of the community for the work Max’s Mission does. She said that both the old system of criminal justice and the new system of harm reduction can benefit drug users, but that her hope now is to make the latter approach more successful. “Everyone is different,” Fogle said. “Drug court worked for me because I chose it, and I wouldn’t have needed drug court in the first place if I had received the kind of services Max’s Mission provides. I want to offer people that chance.”': ""{'PERSON': ['Kassandra Frederique', 'Tony Morse', 'Haven Wheelock', 'Matt Sutton', 'Nate Sickler', 'Mike Marshall', 'Ted Wheeler', 'Tina Kotek', 'Devon Downeysmith', 'Julia Pinsky', 'Brandi Fogle'], 'DATE': ['Three years ago', '2020', 'early the next year', 'Last year', 'last month', '50 years', 'April 5', 'two decades ago', 'this year', 'late 2022', 'second half of 2022', 'as of 2020', 'since Measure 110 went into effect', '15 months', 'as of July 2022', 'In the two years after the law took effect', 'this spring', 'Earlier this year', 'In April', 'Last month', 'Earlier this month', 'no later than December 2025', 'Three and a half years ago', '2020'], 'LOC': ['Oregon', 'America', 'NY', 'America', 'U.S.', 'Oregon', 'Portland', 'Idaho', 'California', 'Washington State', 'Washington', 'West Virginia', 'Indiana', 'Arkansas', 'Jackson County', 'D.C.'], 'ORG': ['Drug Policy Alliance', 'Central City Concern', 'Oregon Recovers', 'Oregon Health Authority', 'Portland State University', 'Oregon Judicial Department', 'Jackson County', 'Health Justice Recovery Alliance', 'Max’s Mission'], 'PROGRAMS': ['Ballot Measure 110', 'Measure 110', 'reform effort', 'reform movement', 'drug-policy status quo', 'a statewide treatment network', 'marijuana legalization', 'public-health strategy called harm reduction', 'nationwide decriminalization push', 'statewide network of harm-reduction and other services', 'grant-making panel', 'state-run health system', 'state cannabis tax revenue', 'governmental-grant-application process', 'treatment-referral hotline', 'drug-possession cases', 'treatment-referral system', 'citation system', 'drug-court programs', 'drug policy', 'substance-abuse problems', 'overdoses', 'oversight of Measure 110', 'school drug-prevention programs', 'synthetic opioids', 'health system', 'state oversight of Measure 110', 'criminal penalties for possession of large quantities of fentanyl','an audit','two dozen aspects of the measure’s performance', 'services around the state', 'treatment meetings', 'reforming drug policy', '19-month drug-court program'], 'IMPACT': ['lifted the fear of prosecution for the state’s drug users', 'not encouraging', 'Oregon’s drug problems have not improved', 'Oregon on an experiment to determine whether a long-sought goal of the drug-policy reform movement—decriminalization—could help solve America’s drug problems', 'sharp rises in overdose deaths', 'highest percentages of adults with a substance-use disorder', 'reducing overdoses', 'stopping the spread of infectious disease', 'providing drug users with the resources they need—counseling, housing, transportation—to stabilize their lives and gain control over their drug use', 'help drug users stop or reduce their drug use and become healthy, engaged members of their communities', 'a model and starting point for states across the country to decriminalize drug use', 'rising overdoses and delays in treatment funding', 'more than 60 percent of respondents blamed Measure 110 for making drug addiction, homelessness, and crime worse', 'bringing back criminal penalties for drug possession', 'tighter restrictions on fentanyl and more state oversight of how Measure 110 funding is distributed', 'number of annual overdoses in the state rose by 61 percent', 'increase nationwide', 'drug possession remains subject to prosecution', 'sudden increase in drug-dealing', 'increase in violence', 'increase in shoplifting', 'exploded to deadly and disastrous proportions', 'drug deaths', 'ecline in overdose rates', 'kept many drug users safe']}""}"
"{'Analysis of 20 million clinical drug tests performed by Quest Diagnostics over the past decade shows increases in drug mixing and amphetamines use, and highlights the need for drug misuse prevention at the earliest stages of risk\r\nSECAUCUS, N.J., Dec. 12, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Quest Diagnostics (NYSE: DGX) released its latest Health Trends® report, ""Drug Misuse in America 2022: A Decade Lost to the Drug Crisis."" The report, which harnesses insights from\xa0more than 20 million clinical drug tests over 10 years, shows that while progress has been made in the last decade of drug misuse, patients of all ages and both sexes are still at risk.\r\nTo access the Health Trends report, visit\xa0Quest Diagnostics Newsroom - Health Trends®.\r\nThe findings reveal that while illicit fentanyl now causes most of overdose deaths, prescription drug misuse involving opioids and other controlled medications taken by patients under the care of a physician continues at a troubling rate. In 2021, nearly half (49%) of people tested showed evidence of prescription drug misuse, compared to 60% in 2012.\r\nAdditional key findings over the past 10 years include:\xa0\r\n<ul><li>Polysubstance use, or drug mixing, has increased. In 2021, 52% of drug tests showed evidence of drug mixing, a relative increase of 58% from 33% in 2012.</li><li>Use of amphetamines has surged 5-fold. In 2021, 9.2% of patients tested were positive for amphetamines, compared to 1.8% in 2012.</li><li>Though individuals of all ages misused medications and illicit drugs at high rates, younger individuals (ages 18-34 years) were more likely to show signs of misuse.</li><li>Of those tested, female patients were more likely to use pain-and-anxiety reducing prescription medications, such as opioids and benzodiazepines, while male patients had higher rates of illicit drugs, such as cocaine.</li></ul>""This year\'s Quest Diagnostics Health Trends® Report underscores the deeply entrenched pattern of prescription drug misuse,"" said report co-author Harvey W. Kaufman, M.D., Senior Medical Director and Head of the Health Trends Research Program for Quest Diagnostics. ""While today\'s policy debates about the drug crisis focus largely on reducing illicit fentanyl use, our nationally representative laboratory data is a stark reminder that even patients under a physician\'s care can be at significant risk of drug-related harms.""\r\n""As a pain specialist, it is beyond frustrating to see similar patterns of dangerous drug mixing and outright misuse today as those observed 10 years ago,"" said board-certified pain expert and report co-author Jeffrey Gudin, M.D., Senior Medical Advisor, Drug Monitoring, Quest Diagnostics. ""As providers and policy makers reflect on the CDC\'s new opioid prescribing guidelines, our laboratory data demonstrates that the medical community must do more to create a truly preventive care model for identifying early signs of prescription drug misuse, similar to screening programs for cancer, heart disease and diabetes.""\r\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently updated its opioid prescribing guidelines\xa0to improve the safety and effectiveness of\xa0pain care, including with prescription opioids. Among other recommendations, the guidance states that clinicians should consider clinical drug testing (toxicology testing) before staring opioids and periodically (at least annually) during opioid therapy when there is risk of overdose due to mixing with other controlled substances. The CDC also recommends that ""clinicians, practices, and health systems should aim to minimize bias in testing and should not apply this recommendation differentially on the basis of assumptions about patients.""\r\n""While our laboratory data does not provide insights based on racial or ethnic characteristics, it does clearly demonstrate that high rates of drug misuse are found in patients of all ages, both sexes and varying kinds of commercial and public health plan coverage,"" Dr. Gudin said. ""Put simply, patients from all walks of life are at risk of misuse. These findings bolster the CDC\'s recommendation that providers aim to reduce bias, such as by applying uniform standards in drug testing.""\r\nIn recent years, the prescription opioid crisis has morphed into an illicit fentanyl crisis, with fentanyl, a highly potent opioid, responsible for more than 70% of all overdose deaths today. Prescription opioids are still widely misused: as many as 13,500 overdose deaths were due to prescription opioids in 2021, versus approximately 16,000 in 2012. Polysubstance misuse, such as mixing one or more prescribed controlled medications, is highly prevalent, while deaths from stimulants such as amphetamines have climbed.\r\nAn estimated 108,000 deaths were due to drug overdose in the 12-months ending June 2022.\r\nFor more information on clinical drug testing and different types of tests, please visit Clinical.QuestDiagnostics.com/WhyClinicalDrugTesting.\r\nQuest Diagnostics Health Trends studies are performed on aggregate deidentified laboratory data in compliance with applicable privacy regulations and the company\'s strict privacy policies, and follow procedures approved by the WCG Institutional Review Board.

"{'Pens, binders, graphing calculator: Check, check, check.\r\nWhat\'s less likely to appear on school supply lists, however, are health-related items for teens and young adults, whether they\'re heading to high school or college.\r\nBut the health landscape has changed drastically over the past three years, and it has become more difficult to know how to prepare. However, experts say, there\'s more information and resources parents can use than ever before.\r\nHere\'s what to know about the tools that are available, where and how to access them, and how to use them.\r\nContraception\r\nLooking ahead to the spring semester, parents can consider the newest addition to over-the-counter contraceptives: a progestin-only birth control pill, called Opill, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration last month.\r\nHRA Pharma, which acquired the pill in 2015, has yet to reveal how much it will cost. And while insurance companies generally cover prescription birth control pills, its unclear if they will cover over-the-counter products when Opill becomes available in early 2024.\r\nWhats also available over the counter:\r\n<ul><li>Condoms\r\n</li><li>Spermicide\r\n</li><li>Contraceptive sponge\r\n</li></ul>Emergency contraception is not technically available over the counter, but most people can access the drug without a prescription depending on the state. Nine states have adopted restrictions on emergency contraceptives, according to the Guttmacher Institute, with some excluding it from their contraceptive coverage mandates and others allowing pharmacists to refuse to dispense the medication.\r\nCommonly known as the morning-after pill, or by its brand name Plan B, the drug is a hormone-based contraceptive that prevents or delays ovulation, which is when an egg is released from the ovary.\r\nGreater access to birth control pills: What else does the arrival of Opill mean?\r\nWhat still requires a prescription:\r\nBesides Opill, all other hormonal birth control pills still require a prescription. Some pills are progestin-only, like Opill, but the most prescribed birth control pills contain both progestin and estrogen.\r\nHormonal contraceptives consist of short-acting and long-acting methods. Short-acting methods are taken on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. Birth control pills are considered short-acting. Long-acting methods can last for years depending on the device.\r\nAccording to Planned Parenthood, other hormonal birth control methods that require a providers prescription include:\r\n<ul><li>Shot; short-acting: Administered every three months and is 94% effective;\r\n</li><li>Patch; short-acting: Replaced weekly and is 91% effective;\r\n</li><li>Ring; short-acting: Taken out once a month and can be 91% effective;\r\n</li><li>Intrauterine device, or IUD; long-acting: A small device thats put into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. It can last between 3 to 5 years, depending on the brand, and is 99% effective;\r\n</li><li>Implant; long-acting: Small, thin rod thats inserted into the arm by a nurse or doctor. It lasts up to five years and is 99% effective.\r\n</li></ul>Fentanyl test strips and naloxone, or Narcan\r\nFentanyl accounted for more than 67,000 preventable deaths in 2021, which represents a 21% increase since 2020, according to the National Safety Council. More than 5,600 of those deaths occurred in people ages 15 to 24.\r\nUsing harm reduction tools like fentanyl test strips and naloxone, the opioid overdose reversal medicine commonly known as Narcan, can help reduce the risk of fentanyl poisoning or accidental overdose, said Dr. Sterling Ransone, board chair and former president of the American Academy of Family Physicians.\r\nIts important to know where to access these tools and how to use them to avoid preventable deaths, said Ransone, who is also a practicing rural family physician in Deltaville, Virginia.\r\nWhat to know about fentanyl test strips:\r\nFentanyl tests strips are small strips of paper that can detect the presence of fentanyl in different kinds of drugs and drug forms, like pills, powders, and injectable substances, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\r\nHow to use fentanyl test strips:\r\n<ul><li>Put a small amount of the drug aside in a clean, dry container.\r\n</li><li>Add water and mix together.\r\n</li><li>Place the wavy end of the test stripe in the mixture and let it absorb for about 15 seconds.\r\n</li><li>Take the test strip out and place on a flat surface for 2 to 5 minutes.\r\n</li><li>Read the results. A single line will appear on the left-hand side of the strip if fentanyl has been detected, indicating a positive result. If there is no fentanyl detected, two pink lines will appear.\r\n</li></ul>While its a useful tool to prevent accidental overdoses, not all fentanyl test strips can be trusted, Ransone said. Some test strips sold online or through friends may be counterfeit or not work properly.\r\n""There are no checks on those folks who can advertise online,"" he said. It\'s important to get fentanyl strips from health departments, community organizations or other trusted sources.\r\nNo prescription required: FDA approves overdose-reversing drug Narcan for over-the-counter sales\r\nWhat to know about naloxone, or Narcan\r\nNaloxone is a medication that can reverse an overdose from opioids including heroin, prescription opioid medications and fentanyl. It can come in a nasal spray or a solution thats injected into the muscle or under the skin, according to the CDC.\r\nNaloxone can be prescribed by a doctor in all 50 states, but some states also have the medication available at local pharmacies without a prescription. Some people also can get naloxone from community-based programs, depending on the state.\r\nBefore administering, the CDC said, its important to call 911 immediately. Try to keep the person awake and breathing, and lay them on their side to prevent choking.\r\nHow to use naloxone nasal spray:\r\n<ul><li>Carefully remove the naloxone from its packaging and hold the nasal spray with your thumb on the plunger.\r\n</li><li>Tilt back the head of the person experiencing an overdose.\r\n</li><li>Place the tip of the nasal spray in either nostril until your fingers are touching their nose.\r\n</li><li>Firmly press the plunger to release the entire dose of medication into their nose.\r\n</li><li>Wait 2-3 minutes for the person to respond. If they dont, give additional doses, switching nostrils, until emergency services arrive.\r\n</li></ul>How to use injectable naloxone: \r\n<ul><li>Take the cap off the vial and stick the needle through the rubber stopper.\r\n</li><li>Draw all the fluid into the needle by pulling back on the plunger.\r\n</li><li>Inject the needle straight into the muscle in the shoulder or into the front of the thigh.\r\n</li><li>Push down on the plunger to empty the syringe.\r\n</li><li>Wait 2-3 minutes for the person to respond. If they dont, give additional doses and stay until emergency services arrive.\r\n</li></ul>COVID-19\r\nCoronavirus transmission has begun to creep up this summer due to travel, less frequent testing and heat waves across the country forcing people to gather inside, leading to a rise in hospitalizations, according to data from the CDC.\r\nTransmission is likely to continue rising in the fall and winter along with other respiratory viruses like influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), experts say, but they\'re not expecting a surge in cases, hospitalizations and deaths like previous years.\r\nMost Americans already have some type of immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, from vaccines or prior infection, and are less likely to develop severe disease. The country is also ready with ample tests at local retailers, and experts say there will likely be a new bivalent booster available in the fall to enhance that immune protection.\r\nThe government is no longer sending free tests since the public health emergency ended in May, but don\'t be too quick to throw away those tests you already received. The FDA has extended the expiration dates of various at-home COVID-19 tests by months and even years. The extended expiration dates by type of test and brand can be found on the agency\'s website.\r\nPeople who get the new bivalent booster will be considered up-to-date on their vaccines, experts say. Americans who didn\'t finish their primary series or get previous boosters will be considered fully vaccinated if they receive the new booster.\r\nMental health\r\nAlthough there\'s no physical toolkit for this, parents can address their kids\' mental health ahead of the school year, said Whitney Raglin Bignall, associate clinical director of On Our Sleeves Movement for Children\'s Mental Health by Nationwide Children\'s Health, a program that offers resources to support children\'s mental health.\r\nThe program provides an online checklist for parents of actions that can improve a child\'s mental health going into the new school year. It includes:\r\n<ul><li>Talking about and practicing any expected changes;\r\n</li><li>Getting back into routine;\r\n</li><li>Getting organized;\r\n</li><li>Talking about expectations for you and your child;\r\n</li><li>Connecting with the school; and\r\n</li><li>Visiting your doctor.\r\n</li></ul>Being prepared, having a routine and knowing what to expect is good for a child\'s mental health, Raglin Bignall said. Getting enough sleep and checking in throughout the year will also help.\r\nParents may want to seek help if they see signs their kids are struggling with their mental health, which may include isolating, not sleeping or sleeping more than usual, having anxiety, avoiding school or complaining of physical symptoms like a stomachache.\r\n""We might want them to see a professional and one of the ways to start doing that is to talk to the school to see if they\'re linked with services or going to see your child pediatrician,"" Raglin Bignall said.\r\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on X, formerly Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT. \r\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

Progression to the UH3 phase is based on an administrative review and is dependent on success in meeting UG3 milestones, NIDCR program priorities, and availability of funds. The NIDCR will be substantially involved with the UG3/UH3 awardees as a partner in providing overall scientific and operational guidance, consistent with the Cooperative Agreement mechanism.\r\nThe UG3/UH3 grant application should include well-developed study development activities and study implementation plans, and it should describe the final design of the UH3 clinical study. Each UG3/UH3 award will support a single UH3 study, and the UG3 planning and UH3 implementation activities must be submitted as a single application.\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nPrescription pain medications, including opioids, are commonly prescribed for the prevention and management of acute post-procedure pain. However, an unfortunate consequence of prescribing opioid medications is the potential for misuse and abuse. In 2016, drug overdose was the leading cause of accidental death in the United States, accounting for 63,632 deaths, including 66.4% that involved an opioid. In addition, recent evidence suggests that short-term opioid exposure in opioid-naïve patients is associated with long-term opioid use. Among persons with no opioid prescriptions in the prior six months who are prescribed at least one day of opioids, the probability of continued opioid use at one year is 6.0%. Further, a prospective study of 12th grade students followed through age 23 suggested that use of prescribed opioids before high school graduation is independently associated with a 33% increase in the risk of future opioid misuse after high school among patients with little drug experience and who disapprove of illegal drug use. Dentists prescribe approximately 6.4 to 8.0% of opioid analgesics dispensed by outpatient US retail pharmacies annually and are the highest percentage prescriber group for patients between 10 and 19 years of age. Most opioid prescriptions written by dentists for adolescents and young adults are believed to be provided to manage acute pain after third molar extraction. These prescriptions may increase the risk for misuse, abuse and diversion of prescription medication in these age groups.\r\nIn addition, data suggest that dental providers’ opioid prescribing patterns for pain management of a dental condition differ by patient socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, sex/gender, and age across the lifespan. Such disparities may be attributed to unconscious biases or cultural differences between dental providers and patients. Further, there is a need to consider alternative approaches to manage acute pain following dental treatment in patients allergic to or unable to take common anlgesics, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), due to medical conditions.\r\nStudies addressing provider decision making in the clinical setting may be necessary to effectively change opioid prescribing practices. Consistent with the American Dental Association’s Interim Board Policy on Opioid Prescribing and the American Dental Education Association’s Policy Brief on The Role of Dental Education in the Prevention of Opioid Prescription Drug Misuse, there is a need to implement clinical decision support systems and other tools to change opioid prescription behaviors towards evidence-based recommendations for acute and chronic oral and craniofacial pain management. This would include educating dental providers to recognize symptoms of substance misuse/abuse, screen for OUDs, and refer at-risk patients to treatment. When substance misuse/abuse is identified, it is important to prepare dental professionals for meaningful interactions with their patients to promote effective referrals to care. Finally, unclear expectations and subconscious bias of dental professionals and patients about the experience and management of post-procedure pain can lead to ineffective or risky pain management approaches. By prescribing opioid medication dosed for five or more days, providers may inadvertently convey expectations of severe pain lasting many days. Conversely, patients instructed to use analgesics for high levels of pain only may experience breakthrough pain. While providers, patients, and other stakeholders likely share a similar goal--safe and effective post-procedure pain management--questions about how best to ensure such care remain unanswered.\r\nRESEARCH OBJECTIVES\r\nIn 2018, NIH launched the Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) Initiative to speed scientific solutions to stem the national opioid public health crisis. Consistent with NIH’s HEAL Initiative, research supported by this concept would address the role of dentistry in overcoming the opioid epidemic. Specifically, this FOA is soliciting applications that: a) Develop and/or test new approaches to manage acute pain following dental treatment, b) implement effective systems to modify dental professional decision-making behaviors towards evidence-based recommendations for acute and chronic oral and craniofacial pain management, or c) promote the dental professional’s role in screening for opioid use disorders (OUDs) and individuals at risk for OUDs.\r\nTo gain more insights about practitioner prescribing practices and patient preferences, studies should consider data collection on providers’ decision-making and prescribing practices to manage post-surgical pain, and independent data collection from patients about their pre-procedure expectations for acute pain management and post-procedure pain experience, analgesic medication intake, and adverse events. User-friendly mobile data collection technologies could be considered to ensure complete reporting of data at multiple timepoints.\r\nSpecific areas of research interest include, but are not limited to:\r\n<ul><li>Determining the need for and\xa0optimal medication course and dosage instructions for analgesicsto manage acute pain following minor surgical procedures, such as tooth extraction, root canal procedures, periodontal surgeries, and implant placement.</li><li>Determining the impact of pre-surgical non-opioid analgesics on the need for postsurgical opioid analgesics.</li><li>Determining the efficacy of non-opioid pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatments for management of chronic oral and craniofacial pain conditions, including multidisciplinary approaches.</li><li>Testing or implementing clinical decision support systems and other interventions designed to modify dental providers’ opioid prescribing behaviors towards evidence-based recommendations for acute and chronic pain management.</li><li>Identifying best practices for dental providers’ interactions with patients to encourage appropriate evidence-based pain management strategies.</li><li>Designing, testing, or implementing OUD screening in dental care settings, to permit appropriate referral to treatment.</li><li>Identifying best practices for dental providers’ interactions with patients to promote effective referrals to substance misuse/abuse treatment.</li><li>Optimizing opioid risk mitigation clinical tools, such as those encouraging the use of PDMPs and counseling, prior to prescribing opioids for pain management.</li><li>Exploring the dental provider and patient expectations to better manage the acute post-procedure pain experience.</li><li>Gaining a better understanding of unconscious biases or cultural norms that may contribute to dental providers’ differential pain management prescribing practices by patient sex/gender, age and individuals affected by health disparities (such as racial and ethnic minority populations, less privileged socioeconomic status populations, underserved rural populations, or sexual and gender minorities).</li></ul>SCOPE\r\nApplicants should propose the strongest research design that is appropriate, acceptable and feasible to answer the research questions. Clinical trial designs may be used where appropriate to establish efficacy or effectiveness of strategies for acute and/or chronic orofacial pain management or screening for OUDs. Studies proposing behavioral or social interventions intended to change provider or patient behaviors must include a test of the hypothesized mechanisms of action of the behavioral intervention, as well as a rigorous plan for ensuring intervention fidelity. Applicants may propose other types of clinical studies such as retrospective or prospective observational studies with specific and well-justified hypotheses corresponding to clearly defined and measurable outcomes.\r\nStudies may be supported by a coordinating center, central laboratory and/or other specialized services. Applicants are encouraged to utilize resources (e.g. CTSAs, electronic health records, administrative databases, patient registries, etc.) to increase the efficiency of study operations. If the application proposes a clinical trial with an investigational drug, biologic or device, the investigators must have received approval for the appropriate investigational application to the FDA prior to the UH3 phase.\r\nMonitoring the degree to which a study intervention is delivered as it was intended (i.e., with consistency or fidelity) is expected for clinical trials research. Fidelity monitoring will ensure the intervention is being delivered in a standardized manner across clinical sites and among interventionist personnel. Fidelity monitoring procedures should be described in the grant application or developed during the UG3 planning phase.\r\nDesign, Analysis, and Sample Size for Studies to Evaluate Group-Based Interventions:\r\n Investigators who wish to evaluate the effect of an intervention on a health-related biomedical or behavioral outcome may propose a study in which (1) groups or clusters are assigned to study arms and individual observations are analyzed to evaluate the effect of the intervention, or (2) participants are assigned individually to study arms but receive at least some of their intervention in a real or virtual group or through a shared facilitator. Such studies may propose a parallel group- or cluster-randomized trial, an individually randomized group-treatment trial, a stepped-wedge design, or a quasi-experimental version of one of these designs. In these studies, special methods may be warranted for analysis and sample size estimation. Applicants should show that their methods are appropriate given their plans for assignment of participants and delivery of interventions. Additional information is available at https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov/.\r\nUG3 Clinical Study Planning Phase\r\nThe UG3 planning phase will provide one year of support for operational and scientific planning activities.\r\nOperational planning activities include, at minimum, finalizing the protocol and preparing other documents to implement the clinical study (e.g., data collection instruments, Manual of Procedures, data management plan). Allowable scientific planning activities include small-scale data collection to assess the feasibility and/or acceptability a planned intervention and/or study procedures (e.g., feasibility of proposed data collection procedures; acceptability of mode of intervention delivery; preliminary testing of intervention training and fidelity monitoring procedures) and assessment of the subject population to determine recruitment potential for the future study. The UG3 phase cannot be used to test for intervention safety or efficacy or assess the study’s primary outcome.\r\nActivities supported during the UG3 phase may include, but are not limited to, development of the following:\r\n<ul><li>A final clinical protocol following International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E6 Good Clinical Practice Consolidated Guidance, prepared using the NIDCR observational protocol template (for observational studies), the NIDCR interventional protocol template (for interventional studies), or the NIH-FDA protocol writing tool if proposing a Phase II or Phase III clinical trial that requires an investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE) application;</li><li>The Manual of Procedures (MOP), which should include a detailed description of study procedures to ensure consistency of data collection across sites and processes for validation and quality control of any non-standard clinical or laboratory/mechanistic testing that will be performed;</li><li>The final statistical analysis plan;</li><li>Final data collection instruments (case report forms) that are ready to be programmed into an electronic data management system;</li><li>The consent form(s) and assent form(s), if applicable;</li><li>The Clinical Investigators Brochure (IB) or equivalent, if applicable;</li><li>A plan to administer study agent or deliver the study intervention, train interventionists, and ensure standardized intervention delivery (e.g., intervention fidelity for behavioral interventions), if applicable;</li><li>The final quality management and data management plans;</li><li>A recruitment/enrollment and retention plan for the clinical study, including strategies should enrollment or retention not meet specified metrics; and</li><li>For applications testing one or more behavioral intervention(s), plans for testing whether the intervention engaged the hypothesized target(s), in addition to efficacy or effectiveness outcomes.</li></ul>Milestones and UG3/UH3 Transition\r\nAll projects must be driven by well-defined, measurable milestones for the UG3 planning phase and annual milestones for the UH3 study implementation phase. A milestone is defined as a scheduled event in the project timeline, signifying the completion of a major project stage or activity. All UG3 grants will need to meet milestones to have an opportunity to move to the UH3 implementation phase. Toward the completion of the UG3 planning phase, the applicant will be required to submit a detailed transition request package, which will undergo an administrative review to determine whether the study will be awarded funding for the UH3 clinical trial implementation phase.\r\nProspective applicants should note that initial funding of the UG3/UH3 cooperative agreement does not guarantee funding of the UH3 phase. Transition to the UH3 phase is dependent on having successfully met the UG3 planning milestones, NIDCR program priorities, and availability of funds.\r\nUH3 Clinical Study Implementation Phase\r\nThe UH3 funding period will provide up to five years of support to conduct the observational study or clinical trial in accordance with activities planned in the UG3 phase. Continued funding during the UH3 phase will be dependent upon meeting annual UH3 milestones, and it is expected that the study will be completed within the UH3 grant period. The study outcome measure(s) must be clinically meaningful and important to stakeholders including patients and health care providers. The NIDCR expects studies supported during the UH3 phase to be hypothesis driven, with well-defined milestones. UH3 activities may include the following operational activities, expressed as UH3 milestones:\r\n<ul><li>Finalization of data management system(s)</li><li>Completion of regulatory approvals</li><li>Study activation</li><li>Registration of clinical trial in ClinicalTrials.gov (for clinical trials)</li><li>Enrollment of the first study participant</li><li>Enrollment and randomization, if applicable, of 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the projected study population</li><li>Completion of data collection</li><li>Completion of primary outcome data analyses</li><li>Reporting of results in ClinicalTrials.gov (for clinical trials)</li></ul>Additional Information\r\nThe proposed clinical study must meet all applicable NIH and Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) policy requirements, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements should be followed where applicable.

The NoA signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the recipient\'s business official.\r\nRecipients must comply with any funding restrictions described in Section IV.5. Funding Restrictions. Selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. Any costs incurred before receipt of the NoA are at the recipient\'s risk. These costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs.\r\nAny application awarded in response to this FOA will be subject to terms and conditions found on the Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants website.\xa0 This includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website.\r\nIndividual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the NIH and are subject to the IC-specific terms and conditions identified in the NoA.\r\nClinicalTrials.gov: If an award provides for one or more clinical trials. By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the ""responsible party"" must register and submit results information for certain “applicable clinical trials” on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website (https://register.clinicaltrials.gov). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm\r\nInstitutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.\r\nData and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&amp;R) and PHS 398).\r\nInvestigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE).\r\n2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements\r\nAll NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the NIH Grants Policy Statement as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General\xa0and Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Recipients, and Activities, including of note, but not limited to:\r\nIf a recipient is successful and receives a Notice of Award, in accepting the award, the recipient agrees that any activities under the award are subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other Department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions.\r\nShould the applicant organization successfully compete for an award, recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex (including gender identify, sexual orientation, and pregnancy). This includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited English proficiency and persons with disabilities. The HHS Office for Civil Rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. Please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.html\r\nHHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this FOA.\r\nPlease contact the HHS Office for Civil Rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html or call 1-800-368-1019 or TDD 1-800-537-7697.\r\nIn accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) requirements. FAPIIS requires Federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS) prior to making an award. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a Federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 CFR Part 75.205 and 2 CFR Part 200.206 “Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.\r\nThe following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) administrative guidelines, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) grant administration regulations at 45 CFR Part 75, 2 CFR Part 200, and other HHS, PHS, and NIH grant administration policies.\r\nThe administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an ""assistance"" mechanism (rather than an ""acquisition"" mechanism), in which substantial NIH programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. Under the cooperative agreement, the NIH purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients\' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. Consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the recipients for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipients and the NIH as defined below.\r\nThe PD(s)/PI(s) will have primary responsibility for:\r\n<ul><li>Providing scientific leadership for all aspects of the study, including planning, any modification of study design, conduct of the study, quality control, data analysis and interpretation, preparation of publications, dissemination of data, tools, and technologies, and collaboration with other investigators.

Applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the Application Guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in Section IV. When the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the Application Guide, follow the program-specific instructions.\r\nApplications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.\r\nBackground\r\nPrenatal alcohol exposure is a leading preventable cause of birth defects and neurodevelopmental deficits in the United States. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) can occur in individuals who were prenatally exposed to alcohol. Alcohol can disrupt prenatal development at any stage during pregnancy, including the earliest stages, often before a woman knows that she is pregnant. A 2018 study estimated that 1 to 5 percent children in the first grade in the US have FASD, the majority of whom were previously undiagnosed.\r\nFASD is an umbrella term for a range of physical, cognitive, and behavioral abnormalities caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. FASD may include any disorder within the FASD spectrum, e.g., fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS (pFAS), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD), and neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE).\r\nAs prenatal alcohol exposure leads to heterogeneous clinical and non-clinical symptoms, individuals with FASD tend to have their own unique combination of day-to-day challenges, which may include medical, behavioral, psychological, educational, and social problems. People with FASD may have difficulty in areas of neurocognition (including global intellectual impairment, executive function deficits, poor working memory, learning problems);\xa0self-regulation (impulse control problems, impaired mood or behavioral regulation, attention deficits, organization difficulties); and adaptive functioning (communication issues, problems with daily living, poor social skills, gross or fine motor delay).\xa0Individuals are affected differently, with some having minor impairments in a single domain, whereas others have multiple difficulties and a lifelong developmental disability.\xa0\r\nThrough this initiative, NIAAA is interested in developing evidence-based prevention strategies to reduce the incidence of FASD and interventions/treatments to lessen the deficits in individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. Reports from prenatal clinics and postnatal studies suggest that as many as 20-30 percent of women drink at some time during pregnancy. Several risk factors have been identified that place offspring at higher risk for FASD, including level of alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy, later initiation of prenatal care, family history of heavy drinking and other factors.\r\nOver the past decade, NIAAA supported the development of various treatment approaches using dietary supplements, sensorimotor training, behavioral interventions, and parenting strategies to improve outcomes in individuals with FASD.\xa0Similarly, NIAAA has funded research into screening, brief interventions, and treatment approaches for high-risk and vulnerable populations, including pregnant women. Despite these investments, challenges remain, with a critical need to build the evidence base for interventions to improve outcomes in individuals with FASD, and for prevention strategies, including primary, secondary, and tertiary approaches, to decrease alcohol use during pregnancy and the incidence of FASD.\xa0\r\nResearch Scope\r\nThis NOFO encourages new studies that propose new strategies for prevention of FASD or intervention for individuals affected by FASD throughout the lifespan, through an R34 planning grant mechanism.\xa0It is expected that research conducted via this mechanism will provide pilot and/or feasibility data for prevention or intervention approaches that are a pre-requisite for preparing and submitting subsequent applications for larger scale projects (i.e., an R01).\r\nThis NOFO is intended for research that aims to pilot and/or feasibility test: (1) novel prevention or intervention strategies based on and informed by translation of basic science findings; (2) theory-based preventions or interventions that need additional evaluation; (3) novel approaches to enhance effectiveness or reach and/or improve scalability of prevention or treatment interventions in community settings; (4) strategies to improve evaluation and/or broad implementation of effective interventions in clinical and other community settings; or (5) strategies to prepare, optimize, or evaluate multicomponent interventions.\r\nApplications to this NOFO are not required to present pilot data in support of the proposed approaches, hypotheses and aims. However, preliminary data may be included. A well-defined theory of change (or logic model) and associated hypotheses are expected. Applicants are encouraged to provide strong evidence of their ability to conduct the proposed study, through documenting the availability of needed resources, evidence of institutional support, the training and experience of the investigator team, and/or the conduct of related studies.\r\nSeveral types of applications are encouraged by this R34 NOFO, including applications addressing pilot and feasibility testing for innovative, scalable prevention and treatment interventions, mixed methods approaches to the development of multi-modal (e.g., behavioral, pharmacological, and/or structural), interventions, modeling approaches that examine hypotheses relevant to scale-up activities, and the development of improved measures relevant to large-scale implementation.\r\n\xa0Study topics include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n<ul><li>Design and evaluate novel policy, community-based, and health messaging and other behavioral and social science approaches to help women reduce or abstain from drinking during pregnancy</li><li>Advance strategies to reduce stigmatization of women who use(d) alcohol, biological mothers of children with FASD, and individuals with FASD</li><li>Improve current prevention strategies to reduce use of alcohol in women of childbearing age</li><li>Identify and mitigate risk factors in populations with high incidence rates of FASD</li><li>Design and evaluate cost-effective, culturally sensitive interventions aimed at preventing FASD in high risk, vulnerable, and diverse populations</li><li>Understand the effects of policies regarding alcohol consumption on maternal health and infant outcomes</li><li>Develop and evaluate prenatal and postnatal therapeutic approaches, medications, and/or dietary components to mitigate the physical, neurocognitive and behavioral deficits associated with FASD across the lifespan</li><li>Advance approaches for parenting/caregiver skills development to improve care for children with FASD</li><li>Develop school-based methods focused on specialized teaching strategies and approaches, including implementation strategies</li><li>Develop and evaluate innovative approaches to improve health and quality of life for individuals with FASD and their families</li><li>Evaluate and implement interventions previously shown to be effective in populations with developmental disabilities for use in individuals with FASD</li><li>Evaluate models for improving identification and access to care for individuals with FASD, such as integration into developmental disability health care services and networks, utilization of telemedicine, or novel technologies.\xa0</li></ul>Notes on priorities\r\nThe main goal of this opportunity is to support research on prevention and intervention strategies to reduce prenatal alcohol exposure and its effects. Applications relating to prenatal exposure to multiple substances (nicotine, cannabis, opioids, methamphetamine, and/or prescription drugs) will be considered responsive; however, the focus is expected to be prenatal alcohol exposure.\xa0\r\nApplications Not Responsive to this NOFO\r\n\xa0\xa0Applications on the following topics will not be considered responsive to this NOFO and will be withdrawn.\xa0\r\n<ul><li>HIV/AIDS related research topics</li><li>Animal studies</li></ul>It should be noted that although estimation of effect sizes is a logical step in evaluating the efficacy of a prevention or intervention strategy or treatment, studies conducted under this mechanism are likely to have small sample sizes, resulting in potentially unstable and unreliable effect size estimates that would have limited utility in power calculations for a larger clinical trial. Therefore, while encouraged, attempting to obtain an estimate of effect size is not an expected outcome.\r\nApplicants are strongly encouraged to consult the Scientific/Research Contact listed below to discuss the alignment of their proposed work with the objectives of this NOFO.\r\nSee Section VIII.

Criteria\r\nOnly the review criteria described below will be considered in the review process. \xa0Applications submitted to the NIH in support of the NIH mission are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system.\r\nFor this announcement, note the following:\r\nThe R34 planning grant supports investigation of novel scientific ideas or new/existing/adapted interventions, model systems, tools, or technologies that have the potential for significant impact on biomedical or behavioral and social sciences research. An R34 grant application need not have preliminary data, extensive background material or preliminary information; however, they may be included if available.\r\nIn addition, for applications involving clinical trials:\r\nA proposed Clinical Trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. Additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation.\r\nA proposed Clinical Trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. Additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation.\r\nReviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed).\r\nReviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field.\r\nSignificance\xa0Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? Is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field?\r\nIn addition, for applications involving clinical trials\r\nAre the scientific rationale and need for a clinical trial to test the proposed hypothesis or intervention well supported by preliminary data, clinical and/or preclinical studies, or information in the literature or knowledge of biological mechanisms? For trials focusing on clinical or public health endpoints, is this clinical trial necessary for testing the safety, efficacy or effectiveness of an intervention that could lead to a change in clinical practice, community behaviors or health care policy? For trials focusing on mechanistic, behavioral, physiological, biochemical, or other biomedical endpoints, is this trial needed to advance scientific understanding?\r\nInvestigator(s)\xa0Are the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)?

Award Notices\r\nIf the application is under consideration for funding, NIH will request ""just-in-time"" information from the applicant as described in the\xa0NIH Grants Policy Statement.\r\nA formal notification in the form of a Notice of Award (NoA) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. The NoA signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the recipient\'s business official.\r\nRecipients must comply with any funding restrictions described in Section IV.6. Funding Restrictions. Selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. Any costs incurred before receipt of the NoA are at the recipient\'s risk. These costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs.\r\nAny application awarded in response to this NOFO will be subject to terms and conditions found on the Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants website.\xa0 This includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website.\r\nIndividual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the NIH and are subject to the IC-specific terms and conditions identified in the NoA.\r\nClinicalTrials.gov: If an award provides for one or more clinical trials. By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the ""responsible party"" must register and submit results information for certain “applicable clinical trials” on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website (https://register.clinicaltrials.gov). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm\r\nInstitutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.\r\nData and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&amp;R) and PHS 398).\r\nInvestigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE).\r\n2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements\r\nAll NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the NIH Grants Policy Statement as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General and Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Recipients, and Activities, including of note, but not limited to:\r\nIf a recipient is successful and receives a Notice of Award, in accepting the award, the recipient agrees that any activities under the award are subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other Department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions.\r\nIf a recipient receives an award, the recipient must follow all applicable nondiscrimination laws. The recipient agrees to this when registering in SAM.gov. The recipient must also submit an Assurance of Compliance (HHS-690). To learn more, see the HHS Office for Civil Rights website.\r\nHHS recognizes that NIH research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this NOFO.\r\nIn accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) requirements. FAPIIS requires Federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS) prior to making an award. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a Federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR Part 200.206 “Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.\r\nNot Applicable\r\n3. Data Management and Sharing\r\nConsistent with the 2023 NIH Policy for Data Management and Sharing, when data management and sharing is applicable to the award, recipients will be required to adhere to the Data Management and Sharing requirements as outlined in the NIH Grants Policy Statement. Upon the approval of a Data Management and Sharing Plan, it is required for recipients to implement the plan as described.\r\n<ul><li>For NIAAA-specific Data Management and Sharing Plan elements see\xa0NOT-AA-23-001.</li><li>For additional NIAAA-specific information on submitting scientific data from studies with human subjects see\xa0NOT-AA-23-002.\xa0</li></ul>\r\nA final RPPR, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the Federal Financial Report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the NIH Grants Policy Statement. NIH NOFOs outline intended research goals and objectives. Post award, NIH will review and measure performance based on the details and outcomes that are shared within the RPPR, as described at 2 CFR Part 200.301.\r\nThe Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 as amended (FFATA), includes a requirement for recipients of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later.\xa0 All recipients of applicable NIH grants and cooperative agreements\xa0are required to report to the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) available at www.fsrs.gov on all subawards over the threshold.\xa0 See the NIH Grants Policy Statement for additional information on this reporting requirement.\r\nIn accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 2 CFR Part 200.113 and Appendix XII to 2 CFR Part 200, recipients that have currently active Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a Federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the System for Award Management (SAM)\xa0about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a Federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period.\xa0 The recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings.\xa0Proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS).\xa0 This is a statutory requirement under section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313).\xa0 As required by section 3010 of Public Law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for Federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available.\xa0 Full reporting requirements and procedures are found in Appendix XII to 2 CFR Part 200 – Award Term and Condition\xa0for Recipient Integrity and Performance Matters.\r\nWe encourage inquiries concerning this funding opportunity and welcome the opportunity to answer questions from potential applicants.\r\neRA Service Desk (Questions regarding ASSIST, eRA Commons, application errors and warnings, documenting system problems that threaten\xa0submission by the due date, and post-submission issues)\r\nFinding Help Online:\xa0https://www.era.nih.gov/need-help\xa0(preferred method of contact)Telephone: 301-402-7469 or 866-504-9552 (Toll Free)\r\nGeneral Grants Information (Questions regarding application instructions, application processes, and NIH grant resources)Email:\xa0GrantsInfo@nih.gov\xa0(preferred method of contact)Telephone: 301-637-3015\r\nGrants.gov Customer Support\xa0(Questions regarding Grants.gov registration and Workspace)Contact Center Telephone: 800-518-4726Email:\xa0support@grants.gov\r\nPreclinical Studies and Medical CareWilliam Dunty, PhDNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)Telephone: 301-443-7351Email: duntyw@mail.nih.gov\r\nElizabeth Powell, PhDNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)Telephone: 301-443-0786Email: elizabeth.powell3@nih.gov\r\nPrevention and EpidemiologyTatiana Balachova, PhDNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)Telephone: 301.443.5726Email: tatiana.balachova@nih.gov\r\nBehavioral, Pharmacological and Education TherapyDeidra Roach, MDNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)Telephone: 301.443.5820Email: droach@mail.nih.gov\r\nRanga Srinivas, PhDNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)Telephone: 301-451-2067Email: srinivar@mail.nih.gov\r\nJudy FoxNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)Telephone: 301-443-4704Email: jfox@mail.nih.gov\r\nRecently issued trans-NIH policy notices may affect your application submission.

"{'The year of COVID-19 vaccine was still a deadly one in Minnesota, where deaths from all causes were more than 15% higher than expected in 2021 mostly because of the pandemic and drug abuse.\r\nMinnesota should have tallied 44,000 deaths in 2021 based on previous years, but the state has surpassed 51,000 so far and could exceed its record set in 2020 after all death certificates are recorded.\r\nMore than 5,000 COVID-19 deaths in each of the two years caused most of the excess, according to a Star Tribune analysis of available death records.\r\n""Thank God some people survive, but too many of them don\'t,"" said Stephanie Vernier of Fridley, who lost her youngest son, Ronald, and a brother to COVID-19 in December.\r\nThe excess numbers are proof the pandemic created additional harm in Minnesota and didn\'t just cause deaths that otherwise would have happened from other illnesses and injuries.\r\nFurther proof is that all excess deaths in the second year of the pandemic were among people younger than age 85.\r\nIn 2020, the oldest Minnesotans made up 45% of the state\'s COVID deaths, but that dropped to 28% last year, partly because fewer members of the greatest generation were alive and at risk by then. Total deaths among those 85 and older in 2021 were exactly as expected.\r\n""The population that is left in 2021 that survived is a different population that is missing some of the most vulnerable people,"" said Elizabeth Wrigley-Field, a University of Minnesota sociologist who has studied pandemic mortality trends.\r\nCOVID-19 vaccination played a role, protecting seniors who were the earliest recipients when the shots became available in early 2021. Vaccination rates were lower among Minnesotans younger than 65, and their COVID-19 death numbers surged from 623 in the first year of the pandemic to at least 1,285 last year.\r\n""Even in a year where you have a ton of pretty good treatments, prevention, vaccines, you still see a ton of death and not just among really sick people in long-term care who have no way of controlling exposure,"" said JP Lieder, a U public health researcher who has studied COVID-19 inequities. ""You\'re seeing it in much younger people and that\'s very correlated with vaccination status.""\r\nRonald Vernier was a warmhearted medical assistant with an unmistakable laugh who worked at a Maple Grove clinic. But he mistrusted the COVID-19 vaccine so much that he was willing to lose his job if it was mandated, his mother said. Several relatives got coronavirus infections when they gathered in November to watch a televised fight, but he was the only one hospitalized.\r\n""Ron was watching what he ate, he was working out,"" his mother said. ""That\'s why, when he first got sick, we weren\'t that concerned. We were like, \'It\'ll go away,\' but it didn\'t.""\r\nX-rays at Mercy Hospital in Coon Rapids were bright white in areas that should have been dark if his lungs were healthy. Vernier\'s breathing worsened, and he was placed on a ventilator before he died on Dec. 9 at age 42.\r\nExcess deaths were more common among minorities members, who have higher rates of chronic health problems such as diabetes and work in more front-line and customer service jobs that increase their COVID-19 risk. Deaths from all causes were 11% higher than expected last year among white Minnesotans but 81% higher among Hispanic residents and 45% to 55% higher among racial minorities.\r\nPao Yang and his wife, Kia Moua, were anticipating life beyond the pandemic, getting passports for a trip to Paris. But Moua, a paralegal with a master\'s degree, contracted COVID-19 and died at age 33 on Oct. 23 after a monthlong battle with the infectious disease. The New Hope woman, who was waiting for more safety information before getting vaccinated, was survived by three children.\r\n""My life is at a standstill,"" Yang said. ""I\'m just a zombie at the moment and still doing daddy duty. I\'m just trying to do the best I can.""\r\nAbout 10% of deaths last year in Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin were caused by COVID-19, according to federal data. The rates were above 17% in Arizona, Nevada and Texas, though. Arizona had the nation\'s highest rate in 2021 of excess death from all causes, 40% above expectations.\r\nMinnesota\'s lower rate could suggest underreporting of COVID-19 as a cause, but Lieder said that was more likely a problem in 2020 when more deaths were reported in homes. Causes are murkier when deaths occur outside hospitals or care facilities, he said.\r\nSuicides rose by 4% in 2021, accounting for little of the excess but underscoring concerns the pandemic exacerbated depression and anxiety.\r\nMinnesota recorded more than 1,000 deaths from unintentional opioid overdoses in a year for the first time, and that caused 9% of the state\'s excess in 2021. Overdose deaths had leveled off in 2018 and 2019 after the death of pop icon Prince and efforts to reduce the prescription of addictive painkillers, but they surged after that.\r\nThe explosion of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl might have increased deaths anyway especially when they are surreptitiously mixed with other illicit drugs but the pandemic added pressures, said Alicia Haugh, a spokeswoman for the Steve Rummler HOPE Network, an advocacy group seeking to reduce opioid abuse.\r\n""The pandemic ushered in a lot of stress and isolation, uncertainty and loss ... Loss of jobs, loss of the norm, and these are all factors,"" she said.\r\nGerald Greenwill never forget the panic Nov. 24 as he called and texted in search of his daughter who was expected to come home for Thanksgiving and the anguish when police arrived at his door in Elk Mound, Wis. The 34-year-old was among three who died at a house party in Fridley after they ingested a white powder that a friend found at a bar. It was cocaine laced with lethal levels of fentanyl.\r\nMany efforts to reduce overdoses are targeted at regular users, including test strips that identify fentanyl in substances, but first-time users and curious novices like Green\'s daughter remain vulnerable, he said. ""The end of a beautiful life, cut short by a fatal mistake in judgment.""\r\nThe pandemic might have exacerbated the opioid problem in other ways, said Dr. Ruth Lynfield, state epidemiologist. Lingering lung damage from known and unknown COVID-19 might have produced ""catastrophic results"" in people who otherwise might have been strong enough to survive overdoses, she said.\r\nDeaths from Alzheimer\'s disease declined 10% in Minnesota in 2021, reflecting the loss of seniors to COVID-19 a year earlier. However, deaths from diabetes increased 20% while those linked to hypertension and hypertensive liver disease increased 42%. Deaths from chronic liver disease increased 36%.\r\nUndiagnosed infections might have played a role in those excess deaths, given how often those conditions were identified in known COVID-19 fatalities. Obesity, hypertension and diabetes were underlying risks or secondary causes of 35% of COVID-19 deaths in Minnesota, according to the Star Tribune\'s analysis.\r\nPeople avoided care for serious health problems because they feared going to hospitals or lost jobs with health benefits during the pandemic, said Dr. Hannah Lichtsinn, an internal medicine specialist for Hennepin Healthcare. That could have increased the number of non-COVID deaths.\r\nOther people sought emergency care but didn\'t receive it right away last fall and winter when hospitals were ""overflowing"" with COVID-19, she added.

One prominent objective is to better understand the heterogeneity in developmental trajectories of alcohol use, risky drinking, and alcohol use disorders. We know that people who initiate alcohol use at younger ages are more likely to develop alcohol use disorders. However, much is unknown about the chain of events between early initiation, episodic excessive drinking, frequent heavy drinking, and the development of an alcohol use disorder. Much is also unknown about how the various risk and protective factors at the micro- and macro-levels at different stages of life interact with each other.\xa0\r\nResearch is needed to address gaps in existing knowledge and scale up effective prevention programs. It is also needed to investigate emerging trends (e.g., increase in deaths from alcohol-associated liver disease, increase in women’s alcohol use and related harms, and upward trends in drinking among older adults as the Baby Boomer cohort ages) and develop prevention and intervention strategies at the various or multiple levels (individual, interpersonal, community, societal) to counteract them.\r\nThe salience of specific risk and protective factors varies over the life course, as well as by biological sex, gender identity, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Consequently, prevention strategies can be tailored to optimize effectiveness for a particular target group or a particular life stage.\r\nThe outcomes targeted by prevention interventions are various. Some seek to reduce early onset, binge drinking, high-intensity drinking, and alcohol use disorders. Others target health conditions including hepatic disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Others target overdose, unintentional injuries (e.g., traffic crashes and falls), interpersonal violence, or suicide. The whole matrix of risk and protective factors by alcohol-related outcomes describes a rich set of potential interventions that can be developed and targeted.\r\nSpecific Areas of Research Interest\r\nNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)\r\nGiven these considerations, this NOSI encourages studies that address NIAAA\'s priorities in epidemiology and prevention research, including, but not limited to, the following:\r\n<ul><li>Use a life course approach to examine the interplay of alcohol use and other risk and protective factors at micro- and macro-levels, from preconception to older adulthood, and across generations, that leads to alcohol misuse and related consequences as well as disabilities, mental health conditions, cancer and other chronic diseases, and premature or accelerated aging. Develop and evaluate methods to examine time-varying drinking patterns at different life stages and across the life course and evaluate the effects of alcohol exposure during particular windows of susceptibility.</li><li>Use systems science methods to model the complex, dynamic interactions of multiple factors that influence drinking behaviors and that lead to alcohol-related harms. Use such models to conduct in silico experiments of interventions to prevent or reduce adverse consequences associated with alcohol consumption.</li><li>Develop and evaluate prevention and intervention strategies tailored for developmental periods and specific populations (e.g., individuals with a disability and/or mental health conditions, and NIH-designated U.S. health disparity populations, including racial and ethnic minority groups, people with lower socioeconomic status, underserved rural communities, and sexual and gender minority groups) when universal approaches are less effective.</li><li>Advance understanding of sex and gender influences in alcohol misuse. Develop and evaluate novel strategies to reduce alcohol misuse among females across the lifespan, e.g., in adolescent girls and pregnant and breastfeeding people.</li><li>Advance prevention of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders and reduce consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure for individuals and families.</li><li>Develop and evaluate strategies to prevent underage drinking and associated adverse consequences.</li><li>Develop and evaluate strategies to prevent and reduce harmful alcohol use among young adults, in college and non-college enrolled, especially those in the military and the civilian work force and other less studied populations.</li><li>Identify coping strategies specific to cultural stress and determine which coping strategies ameliorate or exacerbate the capacity for cultural stress to potentiate alcohol use among underage populations and young adults.</li><li>Understand how subjective response to alcohol and craving change during the developmentally-critical period of adolescence and young adulthood. Understand factors compelling youth and young adults to progress from initial alcohol use to harmful use to alcohol use disorder.</li><li>Identify the factors driving high-intensity drinking and evaluate strategies to reduce its prevalence.</li><li>Understand the nature and extent of harms that misuse of alcohol imposes on others and evaluate interventions to prevent or reduce such harms.</li><li>Develop and evaluate interventions to facilitate positive changes in health and behavior in an aging population, such as promoting drinking reduction or abstention, increasing awareness of alcohol’s health effects and common alcohol-interactive medications, and increasing health care access and quality such as treatment for alcohol-related problems and screening and management of chronic conditions.</li><li>Advance alcohol screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment/prevention (ASBIRT/P) and its implementation. Improve effectiveness and address research gaps (e.g., ASBI in adolescents in primary care and pediatric emergency departments, co-occurring alcohol and other substance use, and comorbid conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression).</li><li>Design and evaluate novel strategies to improve adoption, implementation, and sustainability of ASBI in healthcare, community-based, and other settings and its modifications that address co-occurring conditions.</li><li>Study the effect of public policy and other societal-level strategies on alcohol use, other substance use, and alcohol related harms at the various levels.</li><li>Advance understanding of the role of advertising, marketing, counter-marketing, and warning labels on alcohol use and related outcomes in relevant population subgroups.</li><li>Study the effects/role physical activity plays in the prevention or initiation of alcohol use.</li><li>Examine risk and protective factors and harms associated with concurrent or simultaneous use of alcohol with other substances, such as tobacco and nicotine (including vaping), cannabis, opioids (including fentanyl), and other drugs. Identify and evaluate strategies to prevent adverse consequences associated with co-use of alcohol and other substances.</li><li>Examine the linkages between alcohol misuse and various health conditions, both mental and somatic, and develop and evaluate interventions targeting common factors and sharing biopsychosocial pathways of multimorbidity to increase intervention effectiveness and improve health and well-being.</li><li>Further the development, validation, use and implementation of ecological momentary assessment and other techniques for measuring drinking patterns, testing or refining etiology models, and developing and evaluating in-the-moment prevention.</li><li>Leverage wearable biosensors, digital technologies (including virtual reality), and data science (including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing) to advance alcohol epidemiology and prevention research. Assess the balance of risks and benefits. Integrate ethics into the design, such as privacy protection, data security, consent, model equity and interpretability, accountability, and respecting participant autonomy.</li><li>Expand understanding of the role of social determinants of health, root causes of health disparities, and the utility or influence of gamification, social media, or mass media in the etiology, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of and recovery from alcohol-related problems, including alcohol use disorder, across the lifespan.</li><li>Expand understanding how to use social media to disseminate messages on prevention of alcohol misuse and related consequences.\xa0</li></ul>National Cancer Institute (NCI)\r\nNCI-specific areas of programmatic interest include, but are not limited to:\r\n<ul><li>Epidemiology and etiology of alcohol and cancer incidence and mortality.</li><li>Epidemiology and etiology of co-use of alcohol and other substances, particularly tobacco.</li><li>Epidemiological and etiological studies addressing the effects of reducing alcohol use on cancer risk.</li><li>Improving measurement and methods to assess alcohol use over the life course for epidemiological studies: for example, to develop and evaluate assessment tools (including digital technologies and ecological momentary assessment) and develop and evaluate methods to examine time-varying drinking patterns at different life stages and across the life course.</li><li>Population level efforts to address alcohol use for cancer prevention and control.</li><li>Develop and evaluate interventions among adult cancer survivors to promote drinking reduction or abstention, increasing awareness of alcohol’s effects on cancer, and increasing alcohol risk reduction in cancer care.</li><li>Develop and evaluate strategies to prevent and reduce harmful alcohol use among adolescent and young adult cancer survivors.</li><li>Efforts to understand and address the role of alcohol in cancer related health disparities involving individuals with disabilities, mental health conditions,\xa0and\xa0NIH-designated U.S. health disparity populations, including racial and ethnic minority groups, people with lower socioeconomic status, underserved rural communities, and sexual and gender minority groups.</li></ul>\r\nApplication and Submission Information\r\n\xa0Applicants must select the IC and associated notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) \xa0to use for submission of an application in response to this NOSI.\xa0 Applicants using NIH Parent Announcements (listed below) will be assigned to those ICs on this NOSI that have indicated those NOFOs are acceptable and based on usual application-IC assignment practices.\r\nThis notice applies to due dates on or after October 5, 2023 and subsequent receipt dates through September 6, 2026.\xa0\r\nSubmit applications for this initiative using one of the following NOFOs or any reissues of these announcements through the expiration date of this notice.\r\n<table><tr><td>NOFO\xa0</td><td>Title</td><td>First Available Due Date</td><td>Expiration Date</td><td>Participating IC(s)</td></tr><tr><td>PA-20-183</td><td>NIH Research Project Grant (Parent R01 Clinical Trial Required)</td><td>October 5, 2023</td><td>May 8, 2024</td><td>NIAAA</td></tr><tr><td>PA-20-185</td><td>NIH Research Project Grant (Parent R01 Clinical Trial Not Allowed)</td><td>October 5, 2023</td><td>May 8, 2024</td><td>NIAAA;

The intent of this NOFO is to support research that advances (1) prevention approaches to reduce prenatal alcohol exposure and the incidence of FASD and (2) interventions for FASD. These objectives will be accomplished with the Exploratory/Developmental Phased Award (R61/R33) mechanism, clinical trial optional. The R61 phase will support pilot studies or secondary data analysis for hypothesis development and feasibility, and research testing the hypotheses can be expanded in the R33 phase. The transition to the R33 phase will be determined by NIAAA program staff after evaluation of the achievement of specific milestones set for the R61 phase.

Applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the Application Guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in Section IV. When the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the Application Guide, follow the program-specific instructions.\r\nApplications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.\r\n\xa0\xa0Background\r\nPrenatal alcohol exposure is a leading preventable cause of birth defects and neurodevelopmental deficits in the United States. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) can occur in individuals who were prenatally exposed to alcohol. Alcohol can disrupt prenatal development at any stage during pregnancy, including the earliest stages, often before a woman knows that she is pregnant. A 2018 study estimated that 1 to 5 percent children in the first grade in the US have FASD, the majority of whom were previously undiagnosed.\r\nFASD is an umbrella term for a range of physical, cognitive, and behavioral abnormalities caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. FASD may include any disorder within the FASD spectrum, e.g. fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), partial FAS (pFAS), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD), and neurobehavioral disorder associated with prenatal alcohol exposure (ND-PAE).\r\nAs prenatal alcohol exposure leads to heterogeneous clinical and non-clinical symptoms, individuals with FASD tend to have their own unique combination of day-to-day challenges, which may include medical, behavioral, educational, and social problems. People with FASD may have difficulty in areas of neurocognition (including global intellectual impairment, executive function deficits, poor working memory, learning problems);\xa0 self-regulation (impulse control problems, impaired mood or behavioral regulation, attention deficits, organization difficulties); and adaptive functioning (communication issues, problems with daily living, poor social skills, gross or fine motor delay).\xa0Individuals are affected differently, with some having minor impairments in a single domain, whereas others have multiple difficulties and a lifelong developmental disability.\r\nThrough this initiative, NIAAA is interested in developing evidence-based prevention strategies to reduce the incidence of FASD and interventions/treatments to lessen the deficits in individuals affected by prenatal alcohol exposure. Reports from prenatal clinics and postnatal studies suggest that as many as 20-30 percent of women drink at some time during pregnancy. Several risk factors have been identified that place offspring at higher risk for FASD, including the level of alcohol consumption before and during pregnancy, later initiation of prenatal care, family history of drinking, and other factors.\r\nOver the past decade, NIAAA supported the development of various treatment approaches using dietary supplements, sensorimotor training, behavioral interventions, and parenting strategies to improve outcomes in individuals with FASD.\xa0 Similarly, NIAAA has funded research into screening, brief interventions, and treatment approaches for high-risk and vulnerable populations, including pregnant women. Despite these investments, challenges remain, with a critical need to build the evidence base for interventions to improve outcomes in individuals with FASD and for prevention strategies, including primary, secondary, and tertiary approaches, to decrease alcohol use during pregnancy and the incidence of FASD.\xa0\r\nResearch Scope\r\nThis NOFO encourages studies that propose strategies for prevention of FASD or intervention for individuals affected by FASD throughout the lifespan, through an R61/R33 mechanism. The R61 phase is the first two (2) years of the award, while the R33 spans the following three (3) years. The R61 phase supports initial technical development and proof-of-principle projects, whereas the R33 phase supports further development, application, and evaluation of clinical utility to lay the foundation with which to pursue a larger efficacy trial or study. The application should provide clear aims and measurable objectives for each phase of the proposed research, with explicit discussion of how the results of the R61 phase will inform the R33 phase. Initiation of the second (R33) phase of support is contingent upon successful accomplishment of the objectives and milestones investigators set out in the first (R61) phase of their research.\r\nThis NOFO is intended to support biomedical, behavioral, social sciences research in prevention and/or intervention, including new, exploratory and developmental efforts. Applicants should explicate a clear conceptual link between relevant biomedical, psychological, behavioral, or social factors, and the prevention or intervention components being proposed (including a description of the mechanism of action by which these components are hypothesized to have an effect), and their relationship to the outcomes that are being targeted.\xa0\r\nResearch aims may include, but are not limited to, determination of dosing levels and duration; side effects and safety monitoring; demonstration that outcome measures have appropriate sensitivity to change in the target population; demonstration of feasibility (implementing the intervention and study procedures, evaluating attrition); and working out details of the experimental protocol (e.g., the assessment, experimental intervention and comparison intervention protocols; and randomization procedures, if appropriate).\xa0\r\nStudy topics include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n<ul><li>Design and evaluate novel policy, community-based, and health messaging and other behavioral and social science approaches to help women reduce or abstain from drinking during pregnancy</li><li>Advance strategies to reduce stigmatization of women who use(d) alcohol, biological mothers of children with FASD, and individuals with FASD</li><li>Improve current prevention strategies to reduce use of alcohol in women of childbearing age</li><li>Identify and mitigate risk factors in populations with high incidence rates of FASD</li><li>Design and evaluate cost-effective, culturally sensitive interventions aimed at preventing FASD in high risk and vulnerable, and diverse populations</li><li>Understand the effects of policies regarding alcohol consumption on maternal health and infant outcomes</li><li>Develop and evaluate prenatal and postnatal therapeutic approaches, medications, and/or dietary components to mitigate the physical, neurocognitive and behavioral deficits associated with FASD across the lifespan</li><li>Advance approaches for parenting/caregiver skills development to improve care for children with FASD</li><li>Develop school-based methods focused on specialized teaching strategies and approaches, including implementation strategies</li><li>Develop and evaluate innovative approaches to improve health and quality of life for individuals with FASD and their families</li><li>Evaluate and implement interventions previously shown to be effective in populations with developmental disabilities for use in individuals with FASD</li><li>Evaluate models for improving identification and access to care for individuals with FASD, such as integration into developmental disability health care services and networks, utilization of telemedicine, or novel technologies.</li></ul>Milestones\r\nThe R61 phase supports initial technical development and proof-of-principle projects, whereas the R33 phase supports further development, application, and evaluation of clinical utility to lay the foundation with which to pursue a larger efficacy trial or study. The application should provide clear aims and measurable objectives for each phase of the proposed research, with explicit discussion of how the results of the R61 phase will inform the R33 phase.\xa0Projects should include the following:\r\nIdentification of previous studies and data that will be used to generate or support hypotheses about prevention and/or intervention research in the R33 phase\r\nMeasurable outcomes for the R61 phase studies, i.e. an intervention protocol, pilot projects, feasibility data\r\nClear milestones for the R61 phase and related scientific goals for the R33 phase\r\nProposed pre-clinical studies during the R61 should translate to clinical human studies during the R33 phase\r\nThe objectives for the R33 phase should be based on the findings from the R61 phase. Examples of the goals for the R33 phase include, but are not limited to:\r\nIdentification of points of prevention or intervention for alcohol use or alcohol use disorder, based on the biological response and amount and timing of prenatal alcohol exposure\r\nStudies of pharmacological targets or drug candidates for prevention of FASD or intervention to improve FASD-related outcomes\r\nIdentification of specific targets and intervention components based on psychosocial mechanisms\xa0Rigorous efficacy or effectiveness trials of prevention strategies and/or interventions that translate into clinical practice; studies that assess implementation and scalability of efficacious prevention strategies, policy, and/or interventions.\r\nTransition to the R33 phase is contingent upon programmatic review that will include, but is not limited to, satisfactory demonstration that the R61 milestones have been achieved. Transition to the R33 phase is not guaranteed for all grants awarded under this NOFO.\r\nNotes on priorities\r\nThe main goal of this opportunity is to support research on prevention and intervention strategies to reduce prenatal alcohol exposure and its effects. Applications relating to prenatal exposure to multiple substances (nicotine, cannabis, opioids, methamphetamine, and/or prescription drugs) will be considered as responsive; however, the focus is expected to be prenatal alcohol exposure. Animal experiments may be necessary for pre-clinical testing; however, the focus of this NOFO\xa0 is the translation of findings.\xa0\r\nApplications Not Responsive to this NOFO\xa0\r\nApplications on the following topics will not be considered responsive to this NOFO \xa0and will not be reviewed.\r\n<ul><li>HIV/AIDS related research topics</li><li>Animal research only. (Research strategies must contain components of clinical translation during the R33 phase of the award.)</li></ul>It should be noted that although estimation of effect sizes is a logical step in evaluating the efficacy of a prevention or intervention strategy or treatment, studies conducted under this mechanism are likely to have small sample sizes, resulting in potentially unstable and unreliable effect size estimates that would have limited utility in power calculations for a larger clinical trial. Therefore, while encouraged, attempting to obtain an estimate of effect size is not an expected outcome.\r\nApplicants are strongly encouraged to consult the Scientific/Research Contact listed below to discuss the alignment of their proposed work with the objectives of this NOFO.\r\nSee Section VIII. Other Information for award authorities and regulations.\r\nInvestigators proposing NIH-defined clinical trials may refer to the Research Methods Resources website for information about developing statistical methods and study designs.\r\nGrant: A financial assistance mechanism providing money, property, or both to an eligible entity to carry out an approved project or activity.\r\nApplication Types Allowed \r\nThe\xa0OER Glossary\xa0and the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide provide details on these application types. Only those application types listed here are allowed for this NOFO.\r\nOptional: Accepting applications that either propose or do not propose clinical trial(s).\r\nFunds Available and Anticipated Number of Awards \r\nThe number of awards is contingent upon NIH appropriations and the submission of a sufficient number of meritorious applications.\r\nFor the R61 phase, the combined budget for direct costs during the two-year project period may not exceed $350,000 with no more than $225,000 requested in a single year. For the R33 phase, the direct costs must not exceed $500,000 per year.\r\nThe project period is limited to 2 years for the R61 phase and up to 3 years for the R33 phase. The total project period may not exceed 5 years.\r\nNIH grants policies as described in the NIH Grants Policy Statement will apply to the applications submitted and awards made from this NOFO.\r\n1.

The NoA signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the recipient\'s business official.\r\nRecipients must comply with any funding restrictions described in Section IV.6. Funding Restrictions. Selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. Any costs incurred before receipt of the NoA are at the recipient\'s risk. These costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs.\r\nAny application awarded in response to this NOFO will be subject to terms and conditions found on the Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants website.\xa0 This includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website.\r\nIndividual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the NIH and are subject to the IC-specific terms and conditions identified in the NoA.\r\nClinicalTrials.gov: If an award provides for one or more clinical trials. By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the ""responsible party"" must register and submit results information for certain “applicable clinical trials” on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website (https://register.clinicaltrials.gov). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm\r\nInstitutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.\r\nData and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&amp;R) and PHS 398).\r\nInvestigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE).\r\n2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements\r\nAll NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the NIH Grants Policy Statement as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General and Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Recipients, and Activities, including of note, but not limited to:\r\nIf a recipient is successful and receives a Notice of Award, in accepting the award, the recipient agrees that any activities under the award are subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other Department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions.\r\nIf a recipient receives an award, the recipient must follow all applicable nondiscrimination laws. The recipient agrees to this when registering in SAM.gov. The recipient must also submit an Assurance of Compliance (HHS-690). To learn more, see the HHS Office for Civil Rights website.\r\nHHS recognizes that NIH research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this NOFO.\r\nIn accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) requirements. FAPIIS requires Federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS) prior to making an award. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a Federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 2 CFR Part 200.206 “Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.\r\nNot Applicable\r\n3.

Projects include pragmatic, implementation, or hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials to improve pain management and reduce the use of inappropriate opioid medications. Awards made under this FOA will initially support a milestone-driven, planning phase (UG3) of 1 to 2 years, with possible transition to an implementation phase (UH3) of up to 4 years duration (5 years total for the two phases). UG3 projects that have met the scientific milestone and feasibility requirements may transition to the UH3 phase. The UG3/UH3 application must be submitted as a single application, following the instructions described in this FOA.\r\nThe overall goal of this initiative is to support the ""real world"" implementation of effective interventions to manage pain in rural and remote areas. Results from the trials supported by this funding opportunity announcement (FOA) should inform policy makers, payers, community stakeholders, as well as health care providers and patients in the primary care, emergency department, hospital, home health, or dental settings. This FOA requires that the investigators partner with one or more rural healthcare system(s) to plan and implement the intervention. During the planning phase, investigators must develop an additional one or more community-based partnership(s). Studies may propose to integrate multi-component, bundled, or multi-level interventions that have demonstrated efficacy.\r\nTrials will become part of and work with the HEAL Pragmatic and Implementation Studies to Improve the Management of Pain and Reduce Opioid Prescribing (PRISM) Program, which has leveraged the infrastructure of the NIH Pragmatic Trials Collaboratory, previously known as the NIH Health Care Systems (HCS) Research Collaboratory. (See https://rethinkingclinicaltrials.org/.) The PRISM Program has established a Coordinating Center (CC) that is providing national leadership and technical expertise in all aspects of research conducted within the Health Care Systems. Awarded applicants will work with the CC (http://rethinkingclinicaltrials.org/about-nih-collaboratory/) to facilitate further planning and refinement of the proposed study in partnership with health care delivery systems.\r\nOpen Date (Earliest Submission Date) \r\nLetter of Intent Due Date(s) \r\nOctober 22, 2022\r\n<table><tr><th>Application Due Dates</th><th>Review and Award Cycles</th></tr><tr><th>New</th><th>Renewal / Resubmission / Revision (as allowed)</th><th>AIDS</th><th>Scientific Merit Review</th><th>Advisory Council Review</th><th>Earliest Start Date</th></tr>\r\n<tr><td>\r\nNovember 21, 2022 \r\n</td><td>\r\nNot Applicable\r\n</td><td>\r\nNot Applicable\r\n</td><td>March 2023</td><td>May 2023\r\n</td><td>July 2023</td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\nAll applications are due by 5:00 PM local time of applicant organization.\xa0\r\nApplicants are encouraged to apply early to allow adequate time to make any corrections to errors found in the application during the submission process by the due date.\r\nNot Applicable\r\nIt is critical that applicants follow the instructions in the Research (R) Instructions in the SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide, except where instructed to do otherwise (in this FOA or in a Notice from NIH Guide for Grants and Contracts).\r\nConformance to all requirements (both in the Application Guide and the FOA) is required and strictly enforced. Applicants must read and follow all application instructions in the Application Guide as well as any program-specific instructions noted in Section IV. When the program-specific instructions deviate from those in the Application Guide, follow the program-specific instructions.\r\nApplications that do not comply with these instructions may be delayed or not accepted for review.\r\nPurpose\r\nThis Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) encourages UG3/UH3 phased cooperative research applications to accelerate implementation of effective non-opioid interventions for pain management in rural and remote populations. Projects include pragmatic, implementation, or hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials to improve pain management and reduce the use of opioid medications. Awards made under this FOA will initially support a milestone-driven planning phase (UG3) of 1 to 2 years, with possible transition to an implementation phase (UH3) of up to 4 years duration (5 years total for the two phases). Only UG3 projects that plan a pilot may request 2 years for the planning phase with up to 3 years for the UH3 implementation phase; all other projects may request 1 year for the UG3 phase with up to 4 years for the UH3 phase. UG3 projects that have met the scientific milestone and feasibility requirements may request a transition to the UH3 phase. The UG3/UH3 application must be submitted as a single application, following the instructions described in this FOA.\r\nThe overall goal of this initiative is to support the implementation of effective practices and procedures that may lead to prevention or improved management of chronic pain in rural and/or remote populations, along with a reduction in prescribing and/or using opioids. Results from the trials supported by this funding opportunity announcement (FOA) should inform policy makers, payers, community stakeholders, as well as healthcare providers and patients in the primary care, emergency department, hospital, community health, home health, or dental settings. This FOA requires that the intervention under study be integrated into the health care delivery system that serves individuals who live in a rural or remote community. This does not require the physical setting of the intervention be at a traditional health care facility. Studies can propose to integrate multi-component or multiple interventions that have demonstrated efficacy in other settings.\r\nTrials will become part of and work with the HEAL Pragmatic and Implementation Studies to Improve the Management of Pain and Reduce Opioid Prescribing (PRISM) Program, which has leveraged the infrastructure of the NIH Pragmatic Trials Collaboratory [previously known as the NIH Health Care Systems (HCS) Research Collaboratory]. (See https://rethinkingclinicaltrials.org/.) The PRISM Program has established a Coordinating Center (CC) that is providing national leadership and technical expertise in all aspects of research conducted within the HCS. Awarded applicants will work with the CC (http://rethinkingclinicaltrials.org/about-nih-collaboratory/) to facilitate further planning and refinement of the proposed study in partnership with health care delivery systems. Studies in collaboration with Tribal populations will need to engage in meaningful dialogue to respectfully recognize the sovereignty of each Nation.\r\nFor this application, rural is defined according to the Health Resources &amp; Services Administration (HRSA) definition: All non-metro counties, as defined by the Office of Management and Budget; all metro census tracts with Rural-Urban Commuting Area (RUCA) codes 4-10; and large area metro census tracts of at least 400 square miles in an area with population density of 35 or less per square mile with RUCA codes 2-3; and outlying metro counties without a UA. For more detail on the addition of outlying metro counties, read the Federal Register Notice, Revised Geographic Eligibility for Federal Office of Rural Health Policy Grants. The HRSA Rural Health Grants Eligibility Analyzer can be used to determine which counties and locations are rural areas. HRSA also provides data files to identify rural areas by county, census tract, and those using a zip code approximation. Remote areas, defined by USDA Frontier and Remote (FAR) Area Code 4, are considered both rural and remote; therefore, the definition of rural above will be used for eligibility. The USDA provides data files and maps using the FAR codes. Rural and remote areas may include American Indian and/or Alaska Native Tribal populations.\r\nBackground\r\nRural communities have been particularly hard hit by the opioid epidemic and are disproportionately impacted by opioid-related overdoses. However, patients with chronic pain are present across all geographic areas, and recent evidence indicates that the percentage of adults with chronic pain increases as the place of residence becomes more rural. Furthermore, many patients with chronic pain have comorbidities, including mental health conditions, sleep disturbance, and opioid and/or alcohol use disorders that complicate appropriate pain management. There are known disparities in management of pain in rural areas. Rural residents are more likely to be prescribed an opioid analgesic and less likely to use non-opioid interventions such as self-management, or traditional or cultural interventions for pain than those in non-rural areas. Despite evidence for effective non-opioid interventions, these interventions are not optimally implemented in rural areas.\r\nPain, like other health conditions, is shaped by biological, behavioral, and social determinants of health. To fully address the factors affecting quality pain management, the interrelationships between health policy, healthcare services, biology and genetics, individual behaviors and social factors must be examined. Development and implementation of sustainable, effective non-opioid chronic pain management in rural and remote areas require attention to the social and environmental determinants of health that affect overall health.\r\nIn rural settings, primary care practitioners, including physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants are responsible for addressing patients’ needs for pain management while reducing opioid use. Limited community resources and/or long distances to reach specialists such as behavioral health, pain specialists, and physical therapists increase the challenges of chronic pain management in rural communities. While there have been some promising studies integrating effective, evidence-based pain management in rural settings, there is still a need for coordinated approaches to identify and reduce barriers and accelerate the implementation of high-quality chronic pain care to optimize health and advance health equity.\r\nThere are both guidelines published by various government agencies and clinical and professional societies and evidence for supporting the use of nonpharmacologic approaches as first tier treatment and non-opioid approaches for second tier treatment of chronic pain. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain, for example, states that ""nonpharmacologic therapy and nonopioid pharmacologic therapy are preferred for chronic pain."" The Clinical Practice Guideline from the American College of Physicians also recommends noninvasive, nonopioid treatments for acute, subacute, and chronic low back pain.\r\nThis FOA will support trials testing methods for management of acute pain if the acute pain requires the intervention of a health care provider for management, such as acute dental/orofacial pain or acute low back pain and are likely to recur, become chronic, or escalate to a more serious complication if not managed appropriately.\r\nPragmatic, implementation, and hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials, therefore, are needed because policies, clinical practice guidelines, and tools and interventions have not been readily adopted or adapted and implemented in rural and remote settings. Research is needed to study strategies to equitably and efficiently implement effective interventions and evidence-based pain management guidelines in these settings.\r\nTo effectively address the barriers to and preferences for implementation in rural communities, community engagement, including identification and integration of one or more community-based partners in the UG3 phase are critical to this initiative. Community partnership(s) will be developed in the UG3 phase, but investigators will need to identify the role and characteristics of desirable community partners in the application. Community partner(s) should be located in the rural or remote community and might be a community organization, faith-based organization, community health worker, local library, school, local patient or consumer advocacy group, community champion, or group representing populations that experience health disparities and/or other relevant community stakeholder groups. Community engagement in clinical studies involves patients, families and/or their representatives, health professionals, and the clinical research team working in active partnership at various levels across the continuum of clinical research. Continued respectful, equitable, and bidirectional knowledge transfer during stakeholder engagement can improve participant retention and adherence to the study protocol. Engagement can help build trust in communities that may be fearful of participating in clinical research because of stigmas and medical mistrust. Community engagement can be used to promote health and health research by reducing barriers and enabling research participation by NIH-designated populations that experience health disparities and populations with limited English proficiency. Community-engaged research (CEnR) is participatory and describes methods to operationalize community engagement within clinical research. Engaging the community in research (CEnR) from study planning to implementation contributes to successful health equity study design that is inclusive of diverse participants and provides infrastructure to ensure culturally appropriate research strategies, tools, bi-directional knowledge transfer, and information dissemination are utilized. Partnering with the community helps with development of sustainable interventions and the translation of study results into practice, potentially improving health outcomes. CEnR has the potential to promote wellness by impacting community health literacy and health behavior through community and participant empowerment. When community members participate in their own health promotion by engaging in the research process, they are able to identify their own health needs and develop a sense of belonging within the scientific and medical research community.\r\nThe NIH HEAL Initiative:\r\nThis FOA is part of the NIH’s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain management. More information about the HEAL Initiative is available at: https://heal.nih.gov/.\r\nMeeting Attendance:\r\nThe NIH HEAL Initiative will require a high level of coordination and sharing between investigators. It is expected that NIH HEAL Initiative awardees will cooperate and coordinate their activities after awards are made by participating in Program Director/Principal Investigator (PD/PI) meetings, including an annual HEAL investigators meeting in the D.C. area, as well as other activities.\r\nIn addition, travel to attend two, one-and-a-half-day PRISM/Collaboratory program meetings in the first year and an annual meeting in subsequent years in the greater Washington D.C. area is expected.\r\nDiversity:\r\nIn addition to scientific diversity, applicants should strive to incorporate diversity in their team development plan. Research shows that diverse teams working together and capitalizing on innovative ideas and distinct perspectives outperform homogenous teams. Scientists and trainees from diverse backgrounds and life experiences bring different perspectives, creativity, and individual enterprise to address complex scientific problems. There are many benefits that flow from a diverse NIH-supported scientific workforce, including: fostering scientific innovation, enhancing global competitiveness, contributing to robust learning environments, improving the quality of the research, advancing the likelihood that underserved or health disparity populations participate in and benefit from health research, and enhancing public trust. In spite of tremendous advancements in scientific research, information, educational and research opportunities are not equally available to all. NIH encourages institutions to diversify their student and faculty populations to enhance the participation of individuals from groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and social sciences. Please refer to Notice of NIH\'s Interest in Diversity NOT-OD-20-031 for more details.\r\nFor the purpose of this FOA, we define ""embedded pragmatic clinical trial"" and ""implementation research,"" as follows:\r\nEmbedded pragmatic clinical trials are conducted within a health care delivery system that will oversee delivery of care (which may be provided in traditional or non-traditional health care settings including but not limited to clinics, hospitals, mobile care units, community centers, etc.), and are “primarily designed to determine the effects of an intervention under the usual conditions in which it will be applied,” which is in contrast with explanatory trials that are “primarily designed to determine the effects of an intervention under ideal circumstances” (http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h2147). There are “three key attributes of pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs): (1) an intent to inform decision-makers (patients, clinicians, administrators, and policy-makers), as opposed to elucidating a biological or social mechanism; (2) an intent to enroll a population relevant to the decision in practice and representative of the patients or populations and clinical settings for whom the decision is relevant; and (3) either an intent to (a) streamline procedures and data collection so that the trial can focus on adequate power for informing the clinical and policy decisions targeted by the trial or (b) measure a broad range of outcomes” (http://rethinkingclinicaltrials.org/chapters/pragmatic-clinical-trial/what-is-a-pragmatic-clinical-trial-2/).\r\nImplementation research seeks to understand the behavior of practitioners and support staff, organizations, community and family members, and policymakers in context as key influences on the adoption, implementation, and sustainability of evidence-based health interventions and guidelines (e.g., Community Guide to Preventive Services, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and clinical and professional societies\' recommendations and guidelines). Implementation research studies should not assume that effective interventions can be integrated into any service setting and for consumer groups and populations without attention to local context, nor that a unidirectional flow of information (e.g., publishing a recommendation, trial, or guideline) is sufficient to achieve practice change. Additional information on implementation research, including frameworks for implementation and hybrid effectiveness-implementation research is available at: https://rethinkingclinicaltrials.org/chapters/dissemination/dissemination-implementation-top/dissemination-and-implementation-frameworks/\r\nThe awards supported by this initiative will utilize the existing coordinating center of the PRISM Program, which leverages the infrastructure of the NIH Health Care Systems (HCS) Research Collaboratory, now known as the Pragmatic Trials Collaboratory. The overall goal of the Collaboratory program is to strengthen the national capacity to implement cost-effective large-scale research studies that engage health care providers and delivery systems and patients as research partners. The NIH HCS Research Collaboratory Program established a Coordinating Center (CC) led by Duke University in 2012 (http://rethinkingclinicaltrials.org/about-nih-collaboratory/) that is providing national leadership and technical expertise. In 2019, the HEAL Initiative supported the PRISM Program, which expands the activities of the CC to support the PRISM awards. Awardees from this FOA will work with the NIH and CC to both plan and conduct their pragmatic or implementation trial.\r\nThe PRISM program encourages sharing of resources with broad availability of policies, practices, materials, and tools to facilitate collaboration, reuse, and replication. In addition, the PRISM program encourages sharing of study data from projects in a timely manner with appropriate privacy and confidentiality protections, in accordance with the Data Sharing Policy developed by the Steering Committee (https://dcricollab.dcri.duke.edu/sites/NIHKR/KR/Collaboratory.DataSharingPolicy_June232014.pdf). Thus, the HCS Research Collaboratory program requires awardees to implement a Resources and Data Sharing Plan consistent with achieving these program goals.\r\nCommon Data Elements (CDEs)\r\nThe HEAL Clinical Pain Common Data Element (CDE) Initiative provides an unprecedented opportunity for the pain research community to access quality and meaningful data across pain conditions, diverse populations, and multiple interventions. The HEAL CDE initiative aims to facilitate cross-study comparisons, improve interpretability of findings for patient-reported outcomes, and improve the ability to compare results across trials to quantify the impact of interventions. For studies involving human subjects, projects will be required to use the HEAL Clinical Pain Core CDEs which include measures within nine pain domains and are specific to either adult or pediatric populations and acute or chronic pain conditions. The domains include pain intensity, pain interference, physical functioning/quality of life, sleep, pain catastrophizing, depression, anxiety, treatment satisfaction, and a substance use screener (HEAL CDE Program). Studies that use additional pain screening tools must select from a comprehensive set coded through HEAL or submit their tools for coding to comply with HEAL pain data harmonization. Any outcome measures specific to clinical pain should be validated measures appropriate for the pain condition.\r\nResearch Objectives\r\nThis FOA solicits applications for UG3/UH3 exploratory/developmental phased award cooperative agreements for projects including efficient, pragmatic, implementation, or hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials addressing chronic pain management in rural or remote populations. Projects addressing multiple levels of NIMHD’s research framework are encouraged.\r\nApplications must specify one or more health care systems (HCS) that will oversee delivery of care. There must be two or more sites within the HCS, or multiple HCS to assure inclusivity and sufficient sample size. Sites may include (but are not limited to) rural hospitals, clinics, provider offices, pharmacies, mobile health units or home health providers. HCS partners include but are not limited to large health care systems, small and rural hospitals, Critical Access Hospitals, Rural Health Clinics, Tribal clinics and hospitals, Federally Qualified Health Centers and Indian Health Service (IHS) federally operated healthcare facilities, as well as visiting nurse services/home health agencies. HCS may also include local primary health care providers (including physician, doctor of osteopathy, dentist, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, nurse-midwife, nurse anesthetist, clinical nurse specialist, emergency medical service providers, etc.) at one or more sites of care. For effectiveness studies, the HCS should be large enough to yield sufficient participants to ensure powering the trial design. The design of the proposed project should maximize external validity of the study while maintaining rigor, by testing generalizability, feasibility, and sustainability of findings across rural and/or remote health care settings and diverse staff and patient populations.\r\nIn the UG3 planning phase, one or more additional community-based partners will be identified to participate in the proposed trial. Community partner(s) should be located in the rural or remote community (as described in Part 2, Section I. Background) and might be a community organization, faith-based organization, community health worker, local library, school, local patient or consumer advocacy group, community champion, local group representing populations that experience health disparities, and/or other relevant community stakeholder group. Other potential partners with experience working with rural clinical sites include Area Health Education Centers, Primary Care Associations, State Rural Health Associations, State Offices of Rural Health, Medicare Quality Improvement Organizations. The community-based partner(s) should be fully engaged in the research process from planning through implementation and evaluation.\r\nThe research application should specify the type of proposed research, whether pragmatic, implementation, or hybrid effectiveness-implementation, and must meet all the following criteria:\r\n<ol><li>The project must test an intervention or coordinate several interventions (which can be treatments, preventive actions, or organizational changes) that are robust, apply broadly to pain patient populations, and can be implemented in rural and remote areas, with the broad goal of determining whether the intervention(s) improves pain outcomes/management and adds value to the utilization of the nation’s health care resources.</li><li>The results of the question being tested will have a significant impact on pain management in rural and/or remote populations at the individual or systems level.</li><li>The intervention(s) must be well-characterized and available such that it could be reliably delivered by clinical providers and/or HCS. If an intervention includes a drug, biologic, or medical device, it must be a legally marketed drug, biologic, or medical device in the US, and used as approved/cleared for use by the Food and Drug Administration.</li><li>The intervention(s) must be reasonably simple and not require a complex structure for implementation or monitoring.</li><li>As in routine practice, the project must allow for interventions to be implemented with flexibility and by appropriate practitioners.</li><li>The project outcome measure(s) must be clinically meaningful and important to stakeholders including patients, providers, health care systems, and policy makers. Clinical outcome measures must be defined at the patient, provider, and/or system level. Additional outcome measures, such as use of health care services or medications and other resources may be included.</li><li>The project design must incorporate rigorous controls, prospectively identified, preferably by randomization. The design may incorporate alternative randomization approaches, such as by cluster or timing of implementation. If another method is used to generate the comparison group, perhaps by staged assignment or staged implementation of the intervention, it should provide comparable rigor and the choice should be justified in the application. More than one health care system partner may be needed to enroll sufficient participants for a rigorous study.</li><li>Proposed analytic plans for projects that proposed cluster-randomized trials must address adequacy of sample size and study power and employ analytic strategies relevant for such pragmatic trial designs. Applicants are strongly encouraged to consult Collaboratory Biostatistical Guidance documents (http://sites.duke.edu/rethinkingclinicaltrials/biostatistical-guidance-documents/) when developing pragmatic trial analytic plans.</li><li>The project must enroll patients based on broad eligibility criteria to maximize diversity and minimize intentional or unintentional exclusions based on risk, age, health literacy, demographics, or expected adherence. Projects with a focus on NIH-designated disparity populations in rural and remote areas are encouraged.</li></ol>Studies addressing effectiveness must include:\r\n<ul><li>Sufficient HCS partners or sites to realistically enroll a sample to reach 90% power.</li></ul>Implementation trials must include:\r\n<ul><li>Sufficient evidence for the proposed intervention to justify implementation or de-implementation or the need for intervention adaptation. A strategy to de-implement care is proposed for low-value interventions where there is evidence of no benefit or there is more harm than benefit for patients.</li><li>Outcomes focused on implementation that are most likely at a system or individual provider level. Patient-level implementation outcomes may be possible if focused on the use of the targeted intervention.</li><li>A conceptual model and theoretical justification of the proposed study design and variables tested with a well-defined strategy and reasonable readiness to adopt if primary outcome is met.</li></ul>Partnerships with health care delivery systems, providers, and community-based organizations will be critical in conducting this work. Applicants should name the health care system, describe the role of the health care system, the number of sites available, and indicate the rationale for selecting this health care system or organization. Evidence of support and commitment to the project should be included, such as letters of support, budgets for appropriate providers or coordinators, etc. Applicants should NOT name the community-based partner(s) or organization(s), but should describe the role of the community-based partner(s) and the criteria for selection. Budgets for the community-based partner(s) should be included in the UH3 phase. Applicants, who may be from academic institutions or other organizations, should describe experience in successful conduct of clinical or implementation research in partnerships with health care systems.\r\nThese projects will be funded as phased awards. Only UG3 projects with a planned pilot may request 2 years for the planning phase with up to 3 years for the UH3 implementation phase; all other projects may request 1 year for the UG3 phase with up to 4 years for the UH3 phase. Applications proposing a 2-year UG3 Phase must propose and justify the need for a pilot study that will inform the design of the UH3 Phase. Activities in both phases will depend on the specific study (e.g., disease domains, types of interventions, experimental design, randomization strategy, and proposed outcome measures).\r\nDuring the UG3 or planning phase, activities will generally include but will not be limited to the following:\r\n<ol><li>Identify project staff that will participate in the PRISM/Collaboratory Work Groups (see Section I.5 Additional Information https://rethinkingclinicaltrials.org/cores-and-working-groups/), which will develop guidelines and practices to be implemented across projects.</li><li>Work with the Collaboratory to implement approved guidelines and practices for electronic data extraction and quality control methods and tools, as well as for electronic data sharing, when feasible. In the planning phase, this will include developing and validating all electronic data methods and tools within the health care system needed for the project (e.g., electronic health records, electronic methods for patient identification and outcomes assessment, patient reported data, biospecimens, images, high-throughput genomic data, family history data, data abstraction and survey instruments) and complete quality control testing at all sites. If multiple health care systems are included, there may be multiple electronic health record systems from which data need to be collected.</li><li>Finalize the intervention, including materials and training plans for sites.</li><li>Assess adequacy and finalize clinically relevant outcome measures with other Collaboratory investigators. Awarded applicants will work with other Collaboratory investigators and NIH to identify HEAL Core Measures (pain severity, pain interference, and pain functioning, as well as others); and will work with the CC and NIH to develop metrics for resource utilization for planning and implementing Collaboratory pragmatic trials. If an award is made, NIH and CC staff will work with the Program Directors/Principal Investigators to facilitate coordination among projects.</li><li>Refine estimates of requirements with guidance from NIH and the CC for sample size, numbers of sites, site to site heterogeneity, and implementation timetable based on data derived from the partnering HCS.</li><li>Identify at least one additional community-based partner (not specified in the application) and develop a detailed community partner engagement plan that outlines planned collaborations with community-based study-relevant organizations, patients with lived experience in the community, local patient or consumer advocacy groups, community champions, groups representing populations that experience health disparities, community-based organizations, faith-based organizations and/or other relevant community stakeholder groups. The community engagement plan should:\r\n<ol><li>Describe patient engagement activities and methods to monitor and evaluate outcomes related to engagement</li><li>Describe the roles of community partners from planning through implementation and evaluation of the study</li><li>Describe the characteristics of desirable community partners</li><li>Include linguistic and cultural competence strategies to enable recruitment and retention of populations that experience health disparities</li></ol></li><li>Include resources to compensate community partners and support and sustain community engagement.</li><li>Identity barriers to implementation and patient/provider/community preferences for implementation. Develop detailed plans to address barriers and preferences including participation of community partners in planning and implementation. Examples of issue that may need to be addressed include (but are not limited to) infrastructure needs such as internet or cellular access, appropriate equipment to implement the intervention and monitor patients, transportation issues, etc.</li><li>Develop detailed plans for site implementation, including site staff, method of identification, randomization (as applicable) and participant recruitment and acquisition and administration/implementation of the intervention if applicable. The plans should include site staff training and support in conducting activities needed for implementation, keeping in mind that community partners may have limited experience with research and its activities.</li><li>Put strategies in place should enrollment or retention not meet specified metrics.</li><li>Address all ethical issues and issues related to human subject safety oversight for the project, including the development of informed consent documents or opt-out consent if applicable, and finalize the site of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) review. Applicants must propose a single IRB approach for trial oversight to facilitate both appropriate and timely study implementation, unless review by the proposed single IRB would be prohibited by a federal, Tribal, or state law, regulation, or policy. Address all potential regulatory elements of the proposed trial (if applicable).</li><li>Develop a detailed budget for conduct and completion of the project, including preparation of a final study report. Budget must include appropriate compensation for community-based partners. Finalize detailed plans for data coordination and quality control for the UH3 phase. The CC will not provide these functions for individual projects. Data coordinating activities for individual projects must be budgeted as part of the UH3 budget. The budget should include any costs for data sharing to meet HEAL requirements (see section IV. 2. Resource Sharing). Data sharing activities with the CC do not require separate budgets.</li></ol>Project Implementation Phase (UH3): The objective of the two-to-four-year UH3 implementation phase is to conduct the project in accordance with activities planned in the UG3 phase. Implementation activities will depend upon the study, but in general the following goals should be achieved:\r\n<ul><li>Each project is expected to implement all aspects of the proposed pragmatic trial or implementation research study – including the identification and recruitment of proposed sample sizes of patients, practice sites, and clinicians, as well as the execution of the intervention and its implementation, and the assessment of outcomes.</li><li>Each project is expected to provide complete assessment of all issues related to patient, clinician, and site identification, as well as electronic health record (EHR) tools used in these steps.</li><li>Each project is expected to provide definitive information about the execution of the intervention at all sites.</li><li>Each project is encouraged to assess fidelity to the intervention, when possible, and describe if any efforts will be made to address poor or differential fidelity across sites or study arms.</li><li>Each project is to provide detailed and definitive testing of the validity of methods used for monitoring and outcome assessment.</li></ul>For Pragmatic Trials that aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention Design, Analysis, and Sample Size for Intervention Studies that Assign and/or Deliver Interventions in Groups or Clusters\r\nSpecial research design and method for analysis and sample size are needed in the following conditions:\r\n<ul><li>Participants are assigned to study arms in groups or clusters (e.g., families, clinics, schools, worksites, communities, counties, states) and observations taken on individual participants are analyzed for intervention effects.\r\n<ul><li>Appropriate intervention study designs include but are not limited to a parallel group- or cluster-randomized trial, a stepped-wedge group- or cluster-randomized trial, a rigorous quasi-experimental design such as group- or cluster-level regression discontinuity design or interrupted time-series design, or a rigorous alternative.</li></ul></li><li>Participants are assigned individually to study arms but receive at least some of their intervention in a group (in-person or virtual) or through a shared facilitator or provider.\r\n<ul><li>Appropriate study designs include an individually randomized group treatment trial, a rigorous quasi-experimental design, such as an individual-level regression discontinuity design, or a rigorous alternative.</li></ul></li></ul>Methods consistent with plans for assignment of participants and delivery of interventions should be documented in the application. Additional information and examples are available at https://researchmethodsresources.nih.gov\r\nMilestones and UG3/UH3 TransitionUtilization of milestones is a key characteristic of this FOA. A milestone is defined as a scheduled event in the project timeline, signifying the completion of a major project stage or activity. This FOA will utilize a two-phase, milestone-driven cooperative agreement (UG3/UH3) mechanism consisting of a start-up phase of one or two years (UG3) and a full enrollment and clinical or implementation trial execution phase (UH3). UG3 projects with a planned pilot may request 2 years for the planning phase, all other projects may request 1 year. Projects must include well-defined milestones for the planning phase (UG3) and annual milestones for the implementation phase (UH3). It is understood that the proposed milestones for the UH3 phase will be revised as activities in the UG3 phase progress. In the event of an award, the PD/PI and NIH staff will negotiate a final list of milestones for each year of support. Milestones for transition to the UH3 phase should be quantitative and support a go/no-go decision.\r\nAt the completion of the UG3 planning phase, the applicant will be required to submit a detailed transition request for the UH3 Project implementation phase. UH3 transition requests will undergo an administrative review to determine whether the project will be awarded for the implementation phase (UH3).\r\n<ul><li>All community-based partners should be named prior to the end of the UG3 award.</li><li>All regulatory approvals should be obtained prior to the end of the UG3 award.</li><li>Training of intervention providers, comparison group providers, or other resources should be planned at the start of the UH3 award to allow for the successful launch and execution of the proposed pragmatic trial or implementation study in the UH3 phase.</li></ul>Applicants should understand that initial funding of the UG3 phase does not guarantee support of the UH3 phase and transition to the UH3 phase of the project will occur only if an administrative review process recommends that the UG3 planning milestones have been successfully met, that the UH3 phase can proceed with confidence of success, and that there is an availability of funds. Continuation of the award is conditional upon satisfactory progress, including satisfactory enrollment. If, at any time, recruitment falls significantly below the projected milestones for recruitment, the NIH will 1.) implement a corrective action plan and 2.) if necessary, consider ending support and negotiating an orderly phase-out of the award. NIH retains, as an option, periodic external peer review of progress through existing PRISM, NIH Pragmatic Trials Collaboratory and/or HEAL external advisors. NIH staff will closely monitor progress at all stages, milestones, accrual instances, and safety levels.\r\nResearch Areas of Interest\r\nApplicants must propose a pragmatic or implementation trial to address one or more critical research questions important for chronic pain management in rural or remote populations.\r\nApplications submitted in response to this FOA are strongly encouraged to: 1) include multi-level interventions with systemic implementation strategies that are scalable and conducive to long-term sustainability (beyond the term of award) and can be rapidly implemented in rural and remote healthcare systems; 2) incorporate efficiencies and utilize existing resources (e.g., NCATS CTSAs, practice-based research networks, electronic health records, administrative databases and/or patient registries, rural health research centers) to increase the efficiency of participant enrollment, retention, and data collection; 3) consider subpopulation analysis to determine which interventions work best for specific population and/or cultural groups (e.g., American Indians/Alaska Natives, Hispanics or Latinos, Pacific Islanders, Veterans, occupations such as mining, agriculture, forestry, etc.) including medically underserved, un- and under-insured, Medicare- or Medicaid-eligible populations, and underrepresented groups, with the intent to focus on reduction of health disparities; and 4) assess social determinants of health using measures available in the Social Determinants of Health Collection of the PhenX Toolkit (www.phenxtoolkit.org) or other widely adopted measures, as appropriate. Depending on study design and preference of the rural community, a plan to make the intervention available to all participants after completion of the trial should be considered. Applicants are encouraged to collect data on patient experiences that may affect their chronic pain including Veteran status, occupation, etc.\r\nExamples of interventions and settings include but are not limited to:\r\n<ul><li>Interventions in rural and/or remote health care settings, including primary care (offices, clinics, Rural Health Clinics, Community Health Centers, urgent care, dentist office, home health agency, etc.), acute care (emergency rooms, small and rural hospitals, Critical Access Hospitals, surgical centers, etc.), and other traditional and non-traditional health care settings where pain management disparities are well documented.</li><li>Interventions that address a gap in access to non-opioid pain management for rural and/or remote populations (e.g., mobile interventions, telehealth options, delivery of select services in community settings, non-opioid medications, brief training followed by self-care, etc.).</li><li>Non-opioid pain interventions including but not limited to non-opioid medications, self-care or self-management techniques, non-pharmacologic treatments, physical therapy, and/or training in interventions followed by home practice.</li><li>Interventions that address equity in decision-making for pain assessment, management, and follow up (e.g., assessment of preferences for pain care, use of semi-structured interviews to assess and mitigate bias).</li><li>Evidence-based interventions for effective practices for chronic pain management that have not been implemented or tested in rural or remote populations either on their own or in combination with other tested interventions or novel interventions with evidence of efficacy.</li></ul>The following list provides examples of some of the potential research topics that might be addressed by such trials:\r\n<ul><li>Studies focused on improving access to specialty pain management and non-pharmacological interventions.

NIA is particularly interested in management of pain in the setting of multiple chronic conditions, polypharmacy, socioeconomic deprivation, and physical functional and cognitive impairment. NIA is especially interested in improving health equity of aging populations suffering with pain. As such, applicants are encouraged to propose research that will investigate or address causal drivers and moderators of disparities in pain experience and pain management operating at multiple levels of analysis and domains of influence and across the lifespan. NIA encourages projects addressing priorities outlined in the NIA Health Disparities Research Framework.\r\nApplications that propose behavioral interventions are encouraged to use the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development, focusing on Stage IV and Stage V. For example, the UG3 Phase may include Stage IV studies focused on establishing necessary relationships in rural communities to establish the effectiveness of efficacious simple interventions (e.g., simple “default” or “nudge” interventions, or technology-based interventions that require no training to administer), and the UH3 Phase may include hybrid Stage IV/Stage V studies that examine the Stage IV effectiveness of these interventions in combination with Stage V research examining the mechanisms of action of different implementation strategies.\r\nNational Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)\r\nNIAAA has particular interest in applications examining the use of alcohol to self-medicate chronic pain and how alcohol use impacts implementation of proposed interventions to treat chronic pain. Specific considerations relevant to alcohol include but are not limited to: assessment, across healthcare settings, of alcohol use; co-use of alcohol and opioids to self-medicate chronic pain; ability of interventions to reduce alcohol consumption; incorporation of alcohol-related information into patient, provider, family, and community education materials; and differential effects or impacts of alcohol on chronic pain across health disparity populations.\r\nNational Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS)\r\nThe mission of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) is to support research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases.

In preparing the application, investigators should consider the fact that applications will be assigned a single impact score for both UG3 and UH3 phases.\r\nSpecific Aims: Applicants should address the scientific questions to be answered: what specifically will be done during the proposed funding periods, and what is the impact of addressing the research question on public health. Specific aims should be scientifically appropriate for the distinct phases of the project. Include separate aims, on one page, for both the UG3 and UH3 phase, and clearly label them as UG3 specific aims and UH3 specific aims.\r\nResearch Strategy: Within the Research Strategy, applicants should first describe the UG3 Phase and then the UH3 Phase. The Research Strategy section should have a clear demarcation of the UG3 and UH3 phases of the application. It is not necessary to repeat background information or details of methods in the UH3 portion that were provided in the UG3 portion. Applications proposing a two-year UG3 Phase must propose and justify the need for a pilot study that will inform the design of the UH3 Phase. The UH3 Phase must be described in sufficient detail to permit reviewers to assess significance and innovation of the proposed work and the strength of the experimental design.

Applicants should describe how the results of the question being tested will have a significant impact on pain management in rural and/or remote populations at an individual or systems level. The intervention should be clearly described, well-characterized and available such that it could be reliably delivered by clinical providers or HCSs. The intervention should be reasonably simple and not require a complex structure for implementation or monitoring. The application should describe planned implementation flexibilities including implementation by appropriate providers.\r\nClinically meaningful outcome measures that are important to stakeholders should be described. The level (patient, provider and/or system level) of the outcome measures should be defined. If the study is not randomized, the rigor of the planned controls and justification for the choice of control should be described. All applications should include a clear description of the analytic plan that is appropriate to the type of study (pragmatic, implementation or hybrid effectiveness/implementation). If the project proposes a cluster-randomized trial, explanation of the adequacy of the sample size and study are needed, as well as the planned analytic strategy.\r\nInvestigators are encouraged to describe how the approaches, measures, designs, and outcomes proposed are pragmatic or utilize implementation research methods.\r\nIf the project proposes to implement evidence-based guidelines, applicants are encouraged to describe the quality and level of evidence for the treatments that will be implemented from the guidelines.\r\nThe application should describe the health care system(s) and the investigative team\'s experience conducting pragmatic, implementation, or hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials within health care systems. In general, all studies must use at least one HCS for implementation, which is identified in the application.

The plan should describe data types, file formats, submission timelines, and standards used in collecting or processing the data. Data generated by HEAL Initiative-funded projects must be submitted to study-appropriate domain-specific or generalist repositories in consultation with the HEAL Data Stewardship Group to ensure the data is accessible via the HEAL Initiative Data Ecosystem. Guidelines for complying with the HEAL Public Access and Data Sharing Policy can be found at https://heal.nih.gov/data/complying-heal-data-sharing-policy. Resources and tools to assist with data related activities can be found at https://www.healdatafair.org/.\r\nTo maximize discoverability and value of HEAL datasets and studies and facilitate data integration and collaboration, applications submitted in response to this FOA are strongly encouraged to incorporate standards and resources where applicable:\r\n<ul><li>Applicants are encouraged to ensure that data collected by the study conform to Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles.</li><li>Applicants are specifically encouraged to incorporate into their planning an alignment with the guidelines, principles, and recommendations developed by the HEAL Data Ecosystem, including but not limited to preparing data to store in selected specified repositories, applying minimal metadata standards, and using core HEAL Clinical Data Elements (CDEs) (https://heal.nih.gov/data/common-data-elements) and other necessary requirements to prepare data to connect to the HEAL Data Ecosystem.</li><li>All new HEAL clinical pain studies are required to submit their case-report forms/questionnaires to the HEAL Clinical Data Elements (CDE) Program. The program will create the CDE files containing standardized variable names, responses, coding, and other information. The program will also format the case-report forms in a standardized way that is compliant with accessibility standards under Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C § 794 (d)), which “require[s] Federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities.” HEAL Initiative clinical studies that are using copyrighted questionnaires are required to obtain licenses for use prior to initiating data collection. Licenses must be shared with the HEAL CDE team and the program officer prior to use of copyrighted materials. For additional information, visit the HEAL CDE Program.</li><li>To the extent possible, HEAL awardees are expected to integrate broad data sharing consent language into their informed consent forms and align study consent language with data access and re-use requirements as defined by repository HEAL investigators select to store their HEAL data long-term.</li></ul>The NIH notices referenced below provide additional NIH guidance that should be considered in developing a strong data management and sharing plan. The list is instructive but not comprehensive.\r\n<ul><li>Elements of an NIH Data Management and Sharing Plan (NOT-OD-21-014)</li><li>NIH has provided guidance around selecting a repository for data generated by NIH-supported research and has developed desirable characteristics for all data repositories (NOT-OD-21-016).</li><li>NIH encourages the use of data standards including the PhenX Toolkit (www.phenxtoolkit.org) (for example, see NOT-DA-12-008, NOT-MH-15-009).</li><li>Data should be organized according to a standard model that is widely accepted within the field. An example for the clinical research studies would be the OMOP Common Data Model, which has also been successfully adapted for use with observational (including survey) studies more generally. In addition, the HL7 FHIR® (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard (NOT-OD-19-122) may facilitate the flow of data with EHR-based datasets, tools, and applications.</li><li>NIH encourages clinical research programs and researchers to adopt and use the standardized set of data classes, data elements, and associated vocabulary standards specified in the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) standards, as they are applicable (NOT-OD-20-146). Use of the USCDI can complement the FHIR® standard and enable researchers to leverage structured EHR data for research and enable discovery. In addition to USCDI, OMOP, and FHIR standards for enhanced interoperability, investigators and data centers should align their data collection and management practices with recommended guidance emerging from the HEAL CDE and Data Ecosystem programs.</li></ul>Awardees conducting research that includes collection of genomic data should incorporate requirements under the NIH Genomic Data Sharing Policy (NOT-OD-14-124, NOT-OD-15-086).\r\nLetters of Support\r\nApplications must include a strong letter of support from each of the HCS partners named in the application that relates their commitment to the proposed research and outlines how the project fits with organizational priorities, and the commitment of their staff to the project.

Award Notices\r\nIf the application is under consideration for funding, NIH will request ""just-in-time"" information from the applicant as described in the\xa0NIH Grants Policy Statement.\r\nA formal notification in the form of a Notice of Award (NoA) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. The NoA signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the recipient\'s business official.\r\nRecipients must comply with any funding restrictions described in Section IV.5. Funding Restrictions. Selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. Any costs incurred before receipt of the NoA are at the recipient\'s risk. These costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs.\r\nAny application awarded in response to this FOA will be subject to terms and conditions found on the Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants website.\xa0This includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website.\r\nIndividual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the NIH and are subject to the IC-specific terms and conditions identified in the NoA.\r\nClinicalTrials.gov: If an award provides for one or more clinical trials. By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the ""responsible party"" must register and submit results information for certain “applicable clinical trials” on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website (https://register.clinicaltrials.gov). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm\r\nInstitutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols.\r\nData and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&amp;R) and PHS 398).\r\nInvestigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE).\r\n2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements\r\nAll NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the NIH Grants Policy Statement as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General\xa0and Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Recipients, and Activities, including of note, but not limited to:\r\nIf a recipient is successful and receives a Notice of Award, in accepting the award, the recipient agrees that any activities under the award are subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other Department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions.\r\nShould the applicant organization successfully compete for an award, recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex (including gender identify, sexual orientation, and pregnancy). This includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited English proficiency and persons with disabilities. The HHS Office for Civil Rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. Please see https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html and https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.html\r\nHHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator’s scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this FOA.\r\nPlease contact the HHS Office for Civil Rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html or call 1-800-368-1019 or TDD 1-800-537-7697.\r\nIn accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) requirements. FAPIIS requires Federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS) prior to making an award. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a Federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicant’s integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 CFR Part 75.205 and 2 CFR Part 200.206 “Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.” This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships.\r\nThe following special terms of award are in addition to, and not in lieu of, otherwise applicable U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) administrative guidelines, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) grant administration regulations at 45 CFR Parts 75, 2 CFR Part 200, and other HHS, PHS, and NIH grant administration policies.\r\nThe administrative and funding instrument used for this program will be the cooperative agreement, an ""assistance"" mechanism (rather than an ""acquisition"" mechanism), in which substantial NIH programmatic involvement with the recipients is anticipated during the performance of the activities. Under the cooperative agreement, the NIH purpose is to support and stimulate the recipients\' activities by involvement in and otherwise working jointly with the award recipients in a partnership role; it is not to assume direction, prime responsibility, or a dominant role in the activities. Consistent with this concept, the dominant role and prime responsibility resides with the recipients for the project as a whole, although specific tasks and activities may be shared among the recipients and the NIH as defined below.\r\nThe PD(s)/PI(s) will have the primary responsibility for:\r\n<ol><li>Overseeing the overall budget, activities and performance of the project. The PD(s)/PI(s) must devote a minimum level of effort of 20% annually (2.4 calendar months) to the project. If a project includes multiple PIs, the total annual PI effort must be at least 20%. The institution must obtain appropriate prior approval for any change in PI effort.</li><li>Accepting the participatory and cooperative nature of the collaborative research process and complying with policies and practices developed by the PRISM/NIH HCS Research Collaboratory governing structure.</li><li>Sharing data and resources according to the approved sharing policies for the PRISM/NIH HCS Research Collaboratory program and the NIH HEAL Initiative Public Access and Data Sharing requirements (https://heal.nih.gov/about/public-access-data).</li><li>Participating in all meetings of the PRISM/Collaboratory Steering Committee.

This will include regular reports of accomplishments and roadblocks, conference and meeting summaries, and other reports as requested.</li><li>Submitting materials that meet all subject and formatting requirements.</li><li>Submitting a detailed transition request for the UH3 Project implementation phase, outlining UG3 progress and how negotiated UG3 Milestones have been met, as well as sending detailed plans, budgets, and annual milestones for the UH3 implementation phase. Note that, funding of the UG3 Project planning phase cooperative agreement does not guarantee support of the UH3 Project implementation phase</li><li>Any of the above functions may be performed by the applicant organization or by subcontract to the applicant organization.</li></ol>Recipients(s) will retain custody of and have primary rights to the data and software developed under these awards, subject to Government policies regarding rights of access consistent with current DHHS, PHS, and NIH policies.\r\nNIH staff has substantial programmatic involvement that is above and beyond the normal stewardship role in awards, as described below:\r\n<ol><li>The NIH Project Scientist will work with the PD(s)/PI(s) and the Steering Committee to ensure the objectives of the program are being met. The primary responsibility for the program resides with the recipient, although specific tasks and activities will be shared among the recipient and the NIH Project Scientist.</li><li>NIH staff will interact with the PD(s)/PI(s) on a regular basis to monitor progress. Monitoring may include: regular communication with the PD(s)/PI(S) and his/her staff, periodic site visits for discussion with the recipients’ research team, observation of field data collection and management techniques, fiscal reviews, and other relevant stewardship activities.</li><li>The NIH reserves the right to terminate or curtail the award (or an individual component of the award) in the event of inadequate progress or data reporting.</li><li>Additional NIH staff may participate in all Work Groups, implementation teams and committees, including the Steering Committee, as appropriate. NIH may designate staff from other federal agencies to participate if advantageous to facilitate the activities of the program.</li><li>NIH staff will act as a resource and facilitator for activities of the recipient with non-NIH HCS researchers and other NIH, DHHS, or other federally sponsored research networks that may be relevant to this effort.</li><li>NIH staff will provide input, expert advice, and suggestions in the design, development, and coordination of the infrastructure development and implementation efforts.</li><li>NIH staff will report periodically on progress of the program to the NIH Common Fund, NIH, and DHHS leaders. NIH may convene an external panel of experts to provide advice on program progress.</li><li>NIH staff will conduct an administrative review of the UH3 transition request to determine whether the project will transition to UH3 funding and be implemented. Criteria for transition to the UH3 phase used in the NIH administrative review include: successful achievement of the UG3 milestones, potential for successfully meeting the UH3 implementation phase plans and milestones, demonstrated ability of the team to work within the consortium arrangement, and the availability of funds.</li><li>Additionally, an agency program official or IC program director will be responsible for the normal scientific and programmatic stewardship of the award and will be named in the award notice.</li></ol>Areas of Joint Responsibility include:\r\n<ol><li>Ensuring that NIH HCS sites and investigators as well as NIH and other research partners fully comply with federal regulatory requirements. This includes but is not limited to those relating to human subjects’ protections, informed consent, and reporting of adverse events.</li><li>Jointly developing appropriate confidentiality procedures for data collection as well as processing, storing and analyzing data to ensure the confidentiality of individual patients, health care providers and other institutions involved in any PRISM/Collaboratory research projects.</li><li>Participating in the PRISM/Collaboratory Steering Committee to address issues that span all projects, providing input into the policies and processes of the HCS Research Collaboratory, and assisting in dissemination of policies and processes that enable research in partnership with health care systems, their patients, and practitioners. At a minimum, the Steering Committee will be composed of one representative from each of the projects, one representative from each Work Group, one representative from the CC, the NIH Program Coordinator, and representatives from various NIH ICs and the Common Fund. The combined vote of NIH membership may never exceed 40 percent of the total committee membership.</li><li>Participating in the PRISM/Collaboratory Work Groups that have been established as the core collaborative activity of this program. The Work Groups provide a forum for discussion of challenges and solutions across projects; harmonized and standardized policies and processes will be vetted in these groups. Work Groups have been established in the following areas: Electronic Health Records, Regulatory/Ethics, Biostatistics &amp; Study Design, Health Care Systems Interactions, Implementation Science (if applicable), Health Equity, and Patient Reported Outcomes (http://rethinkingclinicaltrials.org/cores-and-working-groups/). Additional Work Groups may be identified as the PRISM/Collaboratory expands with new projects. Work Groups are open to participation by individuals from all funded Projects, the CCC, and the NIH.</li><li>Recipients will work with other PRISM/Collaboratory investigators and NIH to identify common clinical outcome measures (such as measures of quality of life, physical function, pain, or fatigue). NIH and CCC staff will work with the Principal Investigators to facilitate this aspect of the projects.</li><li>Establishing an adherence by each Project Team (project grantee, CC grantee, and NIH staff) to a written plan of engagement, with timelines, to ensure timely delivery of the tested implementation plan.</li><li>Working together with the CC through all phases of the projects, including the implementation and close out, to assure all resources, materials, protocols, data, best practices, program policies, and lessons learned are disseminated broadly through the CC, to inform researchers and health care systems engaged in research in health care settings.</li></ol>Dispute Resolution:Any disagreements that may arise in scientific or programmatic matters (within the scope of the award) between award recipients and the NIH may be brought to Dispute Resolution. A Dispute Resolution Panel composed of three members will be convened, having three members: a designee of the Steering Committee chosen without NIH staff voting, one NIH designee, and a third designee with expertise in the relevant area who is chosen by the other two; in the case of individual disagreement, the first member may be chosen by the individual recipient. This special dispute resolution procedure does not alter the recipient\'s right to appeal an adverse action that is otherwise appealable in accordance with PHS regulation 42 CFR Part 50, Subpart D and DHHS regulation 45 CFR Part 16.\r\nA final RPPR, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the Federal Financial Report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the NIH Grants Policy Statement. NIH FOAs outline intended research goals and objectives. Post award, NIH will review and measure performance based on the details and outcomes that are shared within the RPPR, as described at 45 CFR Part 75.301 and 2 CFR Part 200.301.\r\nThe Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Transparency Act), includes a requirement for recipients of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later.\xa0 All recipients of applicable NIH grants and cooperative agreements\xa0are required to report to the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) available at www.fsrs.gov on all subawards over $25,000.\xa0 See the NIH Grants Policy Statement for additional information on this reporting requirement.\r\nIn accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 CFR 75.113 and Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75, recipients that have currently active Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a Federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the System for Award Management (SAM)\xa0about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a Federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period.\xa0 The recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings.\xa0Proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS).\xa0 This is a statutory requirement under section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313).\xa0 As required by section 3010 of Public Law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for Federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available.\xa0 Full reporting requirements and procedures are found in Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75 – Award Term and Conditions for Recipient Integrity and Performance Matters.\r\nWe encourage inquiries concerning this funding opportunity and welcome the opportunity to answer questions from potential applicants.\r\neRA Service Desk (Questions regarding ASSIST, eRA Commons, application errors and warnings, documenting system problems that threaten\xa0submission by the due date, and post-submission issues)\r\nFinding Help Online:\xa0http://grants.nih.gov/support/\xa0(preferred method of contact)Telephone: 301-402-7469 or 866-504-9552 (Toll Free)\r\nGeneral Grants Information (Questions regarding application instructions, application processes, and NIH grant resources)Email:\xa0GrantsInfo@nih.gov\xa0(preferred method of contact)Telephone: 301-945-7573\r\nGrants.gov Customer Support\xa0(Questions regarding Grants.gov registration and Workspace)Contact Center Telephone: 800-518-4726Email:\xa0support@grants.gov\r\nKaren Kehl, PhD, RNNational Institute of Nursing Research (NINR)Telephone: 301-594-8010Email: karen.kehl@nih.gov\r\nLaura Elizabeth Kwako, Ph.D.National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA)Phone: 301-451-8507E-mail: laura.kwako@nih.gov\r\nDenise L Stredrick, PhDOffice of Disease Prevention (ODP)Phone: 301-594-7553E-mail: stredrid@mail.nih.gov\r\nPriscah MujuruNational Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD)Phone: 301-594-9765E-mail: mujurup@mail.nih.gov\r\nDevon Oskvig, Ph.D.National Institute on Aging (NIA)Phone: 301-827-5899Email: devon.oskvig@nih.gov\r\nAlexis Bakos, PhD, MPH, RNNational Cancer Institute (NCI)Phone: 301-921-5970Email: alexis.bakos@nih.gov\r\nSusan SheroNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)Phone: noneE-mail: ss632e@nih.gov\r\nBeda Jean-FrancoisNational Center for Complementary &amp; Integrative Health (NCCIH)Phone: 202-313-2144Email: beda.jean-francois@nih.gov\r\nCharles H Washabaugh, Ph.D.National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS)Phone: 301-496-9568E-mail: washabac@mail.nih.gov\r\nSue Marden,\xa0PhD, RNEunice Kennedy Shriver\xa0National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD)Telephone: 301-435-6838Email:\xa0mardens@mail.nih.gov\r\nCheryse A.

"{'Ever since Medicare first proposed significant cuts to specialty providers in order to pay for an increase to physician payment for evaluation and management services, the therapy community including physical, occupational and speech therapists has been working with lawmakers in Congress to reverse the unfair and steep level of payment cuts levied on the specialty provider community.\r\nIn anticipation of the Medicare payment rules for 2022, specialty care providers again asked Congress\xa0for assistance in preventing destabilizing Medicare policies. Now that the\xa0Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) Proposed Rule for CY2022\xa0rule is out, and again includes deep cuts to physical therapy, we need congressional help to avert these dangerous cuts.\r\nDespite broad opposition from stakeholders, the proposed PFS rule includes plans to impose a 3.5 percent cut to physical and occupational therapists in 2022. Taken together with the compounding impact of successive cuts to our specialty, physical and occupational therapists will eventually face a steep 9 percent payment cut by 2024, some of the largest cuts planned for the Medicare program.\xa0\r\nAs more\xa0older\xa0Americans\xa0who depend on Medicare\xa0are becoming dependent on specialty care services, these continued cuts threaten the sustainability of Americas shaken health care system and, ultimately, patient access to critical services.\r\nFor millions of patients, physical therapy services are critical for helping individuals recover from serious injury or illness; building strength, balance, and independence; and managing pain without the use of opioids. By creating an individual treatment plan for each patient, physical therapists not only help address patients immediate needs (e.g., joint pain, limited range of motion and mobility), they also amplify the value of care by lowering the risk of more serious conditions.\r\nFor example, physical therapy empowers seniors to regain balance in order to prevent dangerous falls. According to the\xa0latest data\xa0released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in May, falls caused more than 90 percent of the countrys 2.4 million emergency department visits and 700,000 hospitalizations due to unintentional injuries to older adults.\r\nPatient-specific exercise regimens facilitated by trained health care professionals can\xa0significantly reduce seniors risk of a fall. Not only does this help older Americans live longer, healthier lives, it also helps save Medicare money. With the average lifetime costs for a patient experiencing a fall-related hip fracture\xa0topping over $81,000, and the projected\xa0annual cost of treating falls expected to surge past $100 billion\xa0by 2030, fall prevention strategies are desperately needed.\r\nMoreover, physical therapy is a safe, non-addictive pain management approach. Unlike prescription opioids, which simply mask physical discomfort, physical therapy prevents and treats the underlying cause of each patients pain. Since 1999,\xa0over half a million Americans have died due to an opioid overdose, originally driven by an over prescription of these powerful painkillers. While medications may be appropriate for some, physical therapy has shown to be a valuable tool in reducing seniors aches, pains, and inflammation without the risk of addiction, diversion, or overdose.\r\nFinally, physical therapy is well-positioned to help long-haul COVID patients recover from complications related to their disease. Because lengthy hospital stays often cause muscle deterioration, access to therapies to support strength, balance, and mobility is vital to this patient population.\r\nUnfortunately, if the additional cuts proposed by CMS are finalized, it will be harder for Medicare beneficiaries to access the physical therapy services they need to recover.\xa0Last year, Congress acted to avert devastating cuts for 2021 with just days to spare.\xa0We need Congress to again lead the way in addressing these serious threats caused by the current Medicare payment system. Doing so will ensure continued patient access and financial sustainability for Americas specialty healthcare providers.\xa0\r\nNikesh Patel, PT, DPT, is the executive director of the Alliance for Physical Therapy Quality &amp; Innovation.': ""{'PERSON': ['Nikesh Patel'], 'DATE': ['2022', '2024', '2030', '1999', '2021'], 'LOC': ['America', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention'], 'ORG': ['Medicare', 'Congress', 'Medicare Physician Fee Schedule', 'Alliance for Physical Therapy Quality & Innovation'], 'PROGRAMS': ['Medicare payment rules for 2022', 'Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) Proposed Rule for CY2022'], 'IMPACT': ['a 3.5 percent cut to physical and occupational therapists in 2022', 'physical and occupational therapists will eventually face a steep 9 percent payment cut by 2024', 'more than 90 percent of the countrys 2.4 million emergency department visits and 700,000 hospitalizations due to unintentional injuries to older adults', 'the average lifetime costs for a patient experiencing a fall-related hip fracture topping over $81,000, and projected annual cost of treating falls expected to surge past $100 billion by 2030','over half a million Americans have died due to an opioid overdose', 'cost savings from fall prevention']}""}"

"{'Lawmakers are drawing heat over their pushback against\xa0a federal grant program meant to reduce harm among drug users with ""safe smoking kits,"" with advocates decrying the claims that taxpayer money is being spent on crack pipes.\r\nThe outrage began earlier this month, when\xa0right-wing media outlets\xa0started reporting the Biden administration was funding crack pipe distribution in a bid to advance racial equity an accusation the White House has repeatedly pushed back on as false.\r\nBut as the narrative took hold on social media, lawmakers brought the issue to Capitol Hill.\r\nSen.

Joe ManchinJoe ManchinColor in the climate crisisOvernight Energy &amp; Environment Court ruling delays oil and gas leasingUS, Egypt launch joint working group ahead of UN climate change summitMORE (D-W.Va.) that sought to bar federal funds for pipes used for crack cocaine, as well as syringes and needles.\xa0\r\nThe efforts are being slammed and mocked by advocates who say lawmakers are trying to score political points by opposing funding for what they see as proven methods to reduce harm to people who use drugs, particularly as overdose deaths hit new highs nationwide.\r\nWe are in, literally, a record-breaking overdose epidemic, and for lawmakers to go after harm reduction tools when we need all tools at our disposal to save lives is so irresponsible its shocking, Maritza Perez, the director of the office of national affairs at the Drug Policy Alliance, told The Hill.\r\nThe outrage stems from a new program announced months back that seeks to increase access to harm reduction services for drug users as part of a larger effort to combat that epidemic, which has worsened during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\r\nIn\xa0December, the Biden administration unveiled plans for $30 million to be put toward the launch of a first-ever harm reduction grant program run by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which operates under the Department of Health and Human Services.\r\nOfficials said the funding was intended to support harm-reduction services such as the provision of safe smoking kits to reduce health risks to drug users.\r\nWhile pushing back on reports that the administration is funding distribution of pipes, White House press secretary Jen PsakiJen PsakiBiden has done interviews with multiple Supreme Court contendersPsaki confirms Biden-Putin meeting off the tableWatch live: White House holds press briefing amid escalating tensions in UkraineMORE\xa0said\xa0earlier this month that kits being provided through the SAMHSA program could contain items such as alcohol swabs, lip balm and clean syringes.\xa0\r\n""I would note that what were really talking about here is steps we\'re taking as a federal government to really address the opioid epidemic, which is killing tens of thousands, if not more, Americans, every single day, week, month of the year,"" Psaki said at the time.\r\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released\xa0data last week estimating 104,288 overdose deaths in the United States for the 12-month period ending in September a figure that an agency representative confirmed Tuesday is a new high.\r\nIn recent months, the CDC has also reported a rise in deaths from synthetic opioids, consisting primarily of fentanyl, as well as psychostimulants such methamphetamine.\r\nPeter Davidson, a professor at the University of California-San Diego with years of research experience in areas including drug intervention, stressed the importance of harm reduction services in an interview, while pointing to fentanyl as one of the things that\'s really driving the overdose death epidemic at the moment.\r\nWhat I would really wish and hope for is that lawmakers from any political party, when they first hear this, would actually go out and find out what the science and the evidence actually says about these things, rather than just having an immediate gut reaction, Davidson said.\r\nAccording to the\xa0World Health Organization, people who inject drugs are more likely to contract HIV, tuberculosis and viral hepatitis B and C. The WHO, citing 2020 data from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, said that, of the roughly 11 million people who inject drugs across the globe, about 13 percent live with HIV and 39.4 percent have viremic HCV infection.\r\nA January brief published\xa0by the University of Washington\'s Addictions, Drug &amp; Alcohol Institute said the distribution of safer smoking drug supplies is effective in helping reduce health risks and infection spread from the sharing of smoking supplies.\r\nAccording to the\xa0CDC, decades of research have shown that comprehensive syringe services programs are also a proven means to helping reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, HIV and other infections.\r\nDaniel Raymond, director of policy at National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable, said the time devoted on Capitol Hill to the recent uproar could have been better spent educating the public instead of jumping to stigma and politicized attacks.\r\nThe drugs that we\'re concerned about that are driving overdose rates are different now than they were 10 years ago, he said, and we have to continue to adapt and evolve our strategies to keep up with that reality, and make sure that we\'re hitting the mark.\r\nSome advocates also took issue with rhetoric used by lawmakers and conservative media around the outrage.\r\nFirst of all, the notion that the government is distributing pipes is racist dog whistling. What we\'re talking about are glass pipes, but they use the word \'crack pipes\' for a specific reason, Perez said, before evoking the nations war on drugs and its disproportionate impact on the Black community.\r\nIt\'s another reminder that some people are really willing to stigmatize people who use drugs and kind of perpetuate the racist narratives that fuel the war on drugs, said Jenna Mellor, executive director New Jersey Harm Reduction Coalition.\r\nRubio and other opponents of the government plans to fund safe smoking kits argue that certain tools, such needles, could exacerbate substance use disorder and that they should not be funded by taxpayer dollars.\r\nBut advocates say treatment-first or treatment-only approaches are not always effective.\r\nAccording to 2019 data provided by\xa0SAMHSA, nearly 19 million people aged 12 or older who dealt with an illicit drug use disorder, alcohol use disorder or both went without treatment at a specialty facility. More than 18 million of those did not feel that they needed treatment, the office said.\r\nCaitlin O\'Neill, founder of the New Jersey Harm Reduction Coalition, told The Hill that there\'s a small group of people for whom abstinence does work. But, even in that group, she added, return to use is very normal and very common.\r\nBut advocates say distribution of safer smoking drug supplies has helped serve as a gateway to additional resources for those who use drugs, such as connections to treatment, options for HIV testing, counseling services and food.\r\nWhen someone is being handed a safer smoking kit, it\'s not just being like [at a] drive thru window, you get it and you walk away and you don\'t connect with someone. It\'s being handed to you, and you\'re usually being asked a question of like, what\'s going on? How are you using? added O\'Neill, who said she has also dealt with substance abuse in the past and previously used a harm reduction program.\r\nRubios legislation to bar federal funding for pipes and other drug paraphernalia was blocked by Senate Democrats last week.
