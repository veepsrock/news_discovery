"{'Both cigarettes and opioids are highly addictive—and potentially deadly. Both substances are sold by profiteering companies using science distorted by spin or outright lies. And both have been the subjects of multi-billion-dollar lawsuits.\r\nBut opioids are not cigarettes. And as the opioid settlements finally near completion, it is crucial not to misapply lessons learned from tobacco. Fundamentally, this means accepting that—unlike cigarettes—opioids have genuine uses in both pain and addiction medicine.\r\nSo far, however, we are doing the opposite. Rather than recognizing that some people with intractable pain benefit from opioids, we continue to reduce access— typically without offering affordable and effective alternatives.\r\nRather than acknowledging that closing “pill mills” and identifying “doctor shoppers” more often drives people to dangerous street drugs than to recovery, we frequently abandon patients in withdrawal. And instead of admitting that the best treatment for opioid addiction—the only one proved to cut the death rate by 50 percent or more—is medical opioids (typically buprenorphine or methadone, but some countries use heroin), we primarily offer abstinence-based treatment.\r\nUnderstanding where the analogy between opioids and cigarettes holds—and where it goes astray—can guide better policy.\r\nFirst, unlike for cigarettes, interrupting the opioid supply can kill rather than cure. One recent study of more than 100,000 patients published in JAMA examined dose reductions among people who had taken opioids for at least a year. Researchers expected these cuts to lower overdose risk.\r\nInstead, regardless of how quickly or slowly drugs were tapered, opioid reduction nearly doubled the odds that patients would overdose. And compared with those whose dosages were stable, these patients had more than twice the risk of hospitalization for psychiatric problems, including suicide attempts.\r\nEarlier research bolsters these findings. One study found that patients who had their doses lowered rapidly were nearly four times more likely to die by suicide. Another study, conducted with veterans, showed that abrupt cessation hiked suicide risk by a factor of seven for those who had received opioids long term.\r\nBecause five million to eight million Americans currently take opioids for chronic pain, these data suggest that many of today’s overdose and suicide cases may actually result from our attempts to ameliorate the crisis.\r\nBy contrast, quitting smoking enhances life expectancy (though it can sometimes increase depression in vulnerable populations). And even so, our strategies for fighting Big Tobacco have not involved making cigarettes legally inaccessible to current smokers. Indeed, banning cigarettes outright—or making them available only by increasingly difficult to obtain prescriptions—was not even on the table during settlement talks because regulators appreciated that this would create a large, dangerous black market.\r\nThe same caution was not applied to opioids. Since 2011 prescribing has fallen by at least 60 percent, largely thanks to ramped up prescription-monitoring databases and prosecution of “pill mill” physicians. The crackdown scared even legitimate doctors into dropping chronic pain patients—as well as anyone else who might possibly be addicted.\r\nNot surprisingly, this created a bonanza for dealers—whose products, unlike legal drugs, are unregulated and vary widely in dosage and purity. Consequently, as prescribing dropped, overdose deaths more than doubled, reaching a record high of more than 93,000 in 2020.\r\nYet antiopioid crusaders have dug in their heels, continuing to take the wrong lessons from tobacco’s history. Big Pharma lied about opioid benefits, just as Big Tobacco lied about cigarettes. Therefore, they argued, any positive claims about opioids must be squelched and the medical supply must fall even further.\r\nThis approach obscures facts about addiction that are critical to prevention and treatment. For one, most opioid addiction does not start with medical care. Eighty percent of people who begin misusing prescription opioids get them from friends, family or other illegal sources, not physicians—and nearly all those who become addicted have already used other drugs such as cocaine or methamphetamine.\r\nMoreover, addictions typically start in youth, with 90 percent beginning as experimentation in adolescence or early adulthood. Chronic pain, in contrast, tends to arise in middle or late life.\r\nAs a result, fewer than 8 percent of people who take opioids long term for pain develop new addictions, according to a review co-authored by the director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. In fact, the age group prescribed opioids at the highest rate—those older than 65—has the lowest rate of addiction and overdose. (And no, this research was not funded by Big Pharma, even though they used some of it extremely dishonestly.)\r\nIt is difficult to stop drug-seeking teens by leaving grandma in agony. Policies aimed at minimizing leftover pills prescribed for acute pain make sense—as does providing secure storage for needed meds. But our current strategy of reducing prescribing for chronic pain has failed.\r\nWhile care is needed when applying tobacco history to opioid policy, the settlements do offer one clear cautionary lesson: use the money well.\r\nSome $246 billion has already been paid out by cigarette makers—but nearly all of it falls into states’ general funds. In the 2021 fiscal year, for instance, less than 3 percent of the $27 billion allocated goes directly to smoking cessation and prevention.\r\nTo do better, we must target opioid funds narrowly and spend them smartly. This means moving away from cutting supply and toward offering help.\r\nFirst, doctors must be allowed to continue prescribing forpatients who already take opioids—without fear that doing so responsibly will cost them their license or their freedom. The millions of “legacy patients”—and future patients who have exhausted other options—need a legal safe haven so that they are not killed by dose reductions intended to save them.\r\nSecond, people with addiction need better care: arrest or expulsion from medical practices because of suspicion of misuse is not treatment. When physicians diagnose opioid addiction, they should legally be able to prescribe methadone or buprenorphine on the spot rather than having to send patients to restrictive clinics. In addition, no rehab that fails to offer medications or disparages them should receive government or insurance funding.\r\nIn short, we need to spend settlement funds on proved, effective care—and stop prioritizing\r\nprescription monitoring and enforcement. Despite their dangers, there is currently no substitute for these drugs. While a world without smoking is desirable, one without opioids is a world of pain.\r\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American.': ""{'PERSON': ['None'], 'DATE': ['None'], 'LOC': ['None'], 'ORG': ['JAMA', 'National Institute on Drug Abuse', 'Scientific American'], 'PROGRAMS': ['prescription-monitoring databases', 'prosecution of “pill mill” physicians'], 'IMPACT': ['The crackdown scared even legitimate doctors into dropping chronic pain patients', 'dealers take up the market', 'unregulated drugs', 'overdose deaths more than doubled', 'record high of more than 93,000 overdose in 2020']}}""}"
"{'Deaths of despair have risen during the coronavirus pandemic, and latest research suggests the increase has been dramatic.The pandemic and recession were associated with a 10% to 60% increase in deaths of despair above already high pre-pandemic levels, according to a working paper by Casey Mulligan, professor of economics at the University of Chicago. These non-COVID excess deaths are disproportionately experienced by men aged 15-55, including men aged 15-25, he found.From March onward, excess deaths are approximately 250,000 of which about 17,000 appear to be a COVID under-count and 30,000 non-COVID. Deaths of despair drug overdose, suicide, alcohol in 2017 and 2018 are good predictors of the demographic groups with NCEDs in 2020, Mulligan wrote in his paper, distributed Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research.\r\n“\r\n Mortality in 2020 significantly exceeds what would have occurred if official COVID deaths were combined with a normal number of deaths from other causes.\r\n ”\r\n Casey Mulligan, professor of economics at the University of Chicago\r\nMortality in 2020 significantly exceeds what would have occurred if official COVID deaths were combined with a normal number of deaths from other causes. The demographic and time patterns of the non-COVID excess deaths (NCEDs) point to deaths of despair rather than an under-count of COVID deaths. They increased steadily from March to June and then plateaued. \r\nThey were disproportionately experienced by working aged men, including men as young as aged 15 to 24. Presumably social isolation is part of the mechanism that turns a pandemic into a wave of deaths of despair, Mulligan said. However, he did not speculate on how much, if any, comes from government stay-at-home or business closures to encourage social distancing. \r\nOthers advise caution on such estimates. We do not actually know that these deaths are increasing during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and associate professor of emergency medicine and public health at Brown University, and Jessica Gold, a psychiatrist and assistant professor of psychiatry at Washington University in St. Louis.\r\nIn an op-ed for the health site Stat, they said, Police and crisis hot lines may or may not be receiving extra calls for domestic violence and child abuse. Firearm homicide rates are staying steady. Suicides are certainly occurring, but there is no evidence to date that their rate is on the rise (and we may not know the impact of the pandemic on suicide for years to come).\r\nDespite ample evidence that anxiety is increasing during the pandemic, anxiety alone is rarely a driver for suicide. It is not even a risk factor for it, Ranney and Gold added. Right now it is all too easy to blame every tragedy on COVID-19. Science warns us, however, not to make this fundamental error of attribution.\r\nPeople are, of course, suffering economically. At the height of the pandemic in March, more than 30 million Americans were laid off or furloughed when the economy shut down to curb the spread of COVID-19. The unemployment rate at that point was 14.7%; it has since come down to 6.7%. The leisure and hospitality industries have been particularly hit hard by the pandemic.\r\nIn April, nearly 12 million low-wage workers were laid off, while some 6 million workers who were earning between $18 to $29 an hour were laid off. By November, all but 400,000 of those workers earning $18 to $29 an hour had returned to work, Raj Chetty, a Harvard economics professor, said. Meanwhile, some 6 million workers who earned less than $13 an hour have yet to return to work.\r\nAs of Monday, COVID-19 has infected over 85.2 million people worldwide, which mostly does not account for asymptomatic cases, and killed 1.8 million, including 351,590 in the U.S. The U.S. has the worlds highest number of COVID-19 cases (20.6 million), followed by India (10.3 million), Brazil (7.7 million) and Russia (3.2 million), according to data aggregated by Johns Hopkins University.\r\nMulligan measured actual deaths from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention file for 2020 that begins on Jan. 26, and ended his calculations through week 40 the week ending Oct. 3. COVID-19 deaths and actual total deaths are reported in this file. He defined excess deaths as the difference between actual total deaths and projected deaths, based on previous years.\r\nThe CDC reports 12-month moving sums of deaths from drug overdose, Mulligan wrote. During the nine months before the pandemic, each new moving figure of none-COVID excess deaths (or NCEDs) averaged 680 deaths more than the previous. In March 2020, however, they totaled 1,511 above the previous total. \r\nThe same CDC data through May 2020 show that synthetic opioids such as fentanyl are driving the increases. Given that men have a larger share of fentanyl-overdose deaths than prescription-opioid-overdose deaths, this suggests that men would be disproportionately represented among 2020 NCEDs, he concluded. \r\nSome health professionals have warned of a rise in the epidemic of deaths of despair in the U.S. In fact, approximately 75,000 more people will likely die from drug or alcohol misuse and suicide as a result, according to predictions released last March by Well Being Trust and the Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care.\r\n“\r\n A complex constellation of risk factors, only a few of which are directly tied to COVID-19, are known to drive these tragic deaths.\r\n ”\r\n Megan Ranney, an emergency physician, and Jessica Gold, a psychiatrist, writing in Stat\r\nProjections of additional deaths of despair range from 27,644, assuming a quick economic recovery and the smallest impact from unemployment, to 154,037, assuming a slow recovery and the greatest impact from unemployment. We can prevent these deaths by taking meaningful and comprehensive action as a nation, the researchers wrote in the report.\r\nMore Americans could lose their lives to deaths of despair, deaths due to drug, alcohol, and suicide, if we do not do something immediately, the report said. Deaths of despair have been on the rise for the last decade, and in the context of COVID-19, deaths of despair should be seen as the epidemic within the pandemic.\r\nHowever, Ranney and Gold said those results should be taken with some serious caveats. These projections are based on data from the Great Recession, meaning the models werent able to factor in the unique aspects of what is happening today, such as how new technologies make possible increased virtual social connection and support, they added.\r\nA complex constellation of risk factors, only a few of which are directly tied to COVID-19, are known to drive these tragic deaths, they wrote. We have evidence-based interventions that can reduce the rates of many of the risk factors for all of these deaths whether or not the country is practicing social distancing, hand-washing, and mask wearing.\r\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly warned that efforts to stem the rapid spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, are spiraling the economy into another Great Recession; the impact has sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average \r\n DJIA,\r\n +0.65%\r\n\xa0ricocheting wildly in recent months. \r\nThe federal government must fully support and invest in a plan to improve mental-health care, said Benjamin Miller, chief strategy officer at the Well Being Trust. If we work to put in place healthy community conditions, good health-care coverage, and inclusive policies, we can improve mental health and well-being, he added.\r\nThe Well Being Trust is a national foundation dedicated to advancing the mental, social, and spiritual health of the nation. The Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care is an independent research unit affiliated with the American Academy of Family Physicians, and works to improve individual and population health by enhancing the delivery of primary care. \r\nDont miss: New estimates on coronavirus fatalities make for chilling reading as U.S. states ease restrictions on social distancing\r\nAnne Case and Angus Deaton, economists at Princeton University, first chronicled these deaths of despair among middle-aged non-Hispanic caucasians since 1999. They include deaths by suicide, alcohol poisoning, overdoses of opioids and other drugs, and cirrhosis of the liver. The CDC estimates theyve almost doubled since 1999, reaching 150,000 in 2017.\r\nSARS CoV-2 is having an unprecedented impact on the world. No one alive can recall any infection or worldwide event of such magnitude and scale, the new report added. Along with the tens of thousands of deaths in the United States from the virus, COVID-19 overlays the growing epidemic of deaths of despair threatening to make an already significant problem even worse. \r\nThe researchers issued a warning for the months and even years ahead, arguing for additional investment in health care and strategies to deal with the phenomenon. A preventable surge of avoidable deaths from drugs, alcohol, and suicide is ahead of us if the country does not begin to invest in solutions that can help heal the nations isolation, pain, and suffering, they wrote. \r\nThe debate over the ramifications of a months-long shutdown of the American economy has been at times both emotional and sobering. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for more than three decades and one of the leading experts in the U.S. on infectious diseases, has pleaded with people to socially distance.\r\nThe debate over the economys survival vs. the public health emergency highlights, as well, the chasm between left and right on the American political spectrum. The left generally believes that strong social structures beget a stronger economy for all. The right traditionally follows the idea that a strong economic system begets strong social structures for all.\r\nRanney and Gold argue that drawing a line between deaths of despair and political policies to reduce social distancing is a crude one. It is also wrong to imply that reopening the country will, in and of itself, stop deaths of despair. Jobs may or may not rebound when social distancing rules are relaxed. Much of the decline in travel and eating in restaurants predated formal rules about social distancing.': ""{'PERSON': ['Casey Mulligan', 'Megan Ranney', 'Jessica Gold', 'Raj Chetty', 'Benjamin Miller', 'Anne Case', 'Angus Deaton', 'Anthony Fauci'], 'DATE': ['From March onward', 'Monday', 'During the nine months before the pandemic', 'In March 2020', 'through May 2020', 'last March', 'since 1999', 'in 2017'], 'LOC': ['Chicago', 'University in St. Louis', 'Brown University', 'Harvard', 'Princeton University'], 'ORG': ['University of Chicago', 'National Bureau of Economic Research', 'Brown University', 'Washington University', 'Johns Hopkins University', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Well Being Trust', 'Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care', 'the Well Being Trust', 'The Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care', 'American Academy of Family Physicians', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases'], 'PROGRAMS': ['resource hub', 'virtual social connection and support'], 'IMPACT': ['excess deaths are approximately 250,000 of which about 17,000 appear to be a COVID under-count and 30,000 non-COVID', 'increased steadily from March to June and then plateaued', 'the CDC estimates they’ve almost doubled since 1999, reaching 150,000 in 2017']}""}"
"{'On March 1 the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case that could have an enormous impact on American medicine. The case, which involves combined appeals from two doctors, Xiulu Ruan and Shakeel Kahn, is intended to resolve an important question that has had a chilling effect on both pain and addiction care. If the court decides against these defendants, people in the U.S. who are in agony may be unable to get needed relief.\r\nThe legal issue is this: Must prosecutors prove that doctors accused of overprescribing controlled substances intended to act as drug dealers? Or can physicians unknowingly violate the standards of care so severely that they cross the line into criminal behavior?\r\nTo many, the answer is obvious: if doctors genuinely believe they are performing their duties as physicians and are following the law, they should not be charged with a crime. A surgeon, for instance, might do something that leads to a patient dying on the operating table, but in order for malpractice to be deemed murder, prosecutors must prove that the death was caused by more than a slip of the scalpel.\r\nWith controlled substances, however—especially during an overdose crisis that has now taken more than 100,000 lives in a single year—these issues have become more complicated.\xa0\r\nIn the case before the Supreme Court, the two doctors were charged with distributing drugs for profit after law enforcement became aware that they were writing large numbers of opioid prescriptions. In Ruan’s trial, prosecutors presented evidence that the doctor dramatically increased his prescribing of a form of fentanyl after making a $1.6 million-dollar investment in the stock of its manufacturer. Testimony about Kahn showed that many of his patients were selling the drugs he prescribed to them and that he had written prescriptions without performing examinations. Kahn was also charged with causing the overdose death of a patient. Ruan, who practiced in Alabama, was sentenced to 21 years in prison; Kahn, in Wyoming and Arizona, got 25 years.\r\nThe Supreme Court will not determine whether the physicians are innocent or guilty; instead it will focus on whether they should have the right to defend their actions as being done in good faith—a right their lawyers claim was infringed on because of improper jury instructions.\r\nThe case comes out of the disastrous U.S. policy response to rising rates of prescription opioid overdoses, which more than doubled between 1999 and 2010 as prescribing rates skyrocketed. The ambiguity in the law and the rising death rates made it easy for prosecutors to target physicians—and those prosecutions had the intended effect of scaring many doctors away from prescribing opioids, regardless of their patients’ needs.\r\nUnsurprisingly, this has had a harmful effect on pain care. A recent study found that between 2007 and 2017, opioid prescriptions for people with terminal cancer fell by nearly 40 percent, despite the fact that there is little connection between end-of-life care and the overdose crisis, and despite policies and standards that explicitly exempt such patients from opioid cutbacks.\r\nThe situation for people with intractable chronic pain is even worse: thousands have had their doses reduced or eliminated by doctors who fear prosecution for accidental drug trafficking. Research has shown that rather than reducing harm to patients, such cuts can dramatically increase their risk for suicide and overdose.\r\nTo top it all off, restrictions on prescription opioids have not reduced overdose deaths in general. Instead the number of deaths more than doubled between 2011 and 2020; in that same period opioid prescribing was cut by more than half, and it is now back to precrisis levels.\r\nAddiction care is also undermined by this legal uncertainty. The only two treatments proven to reduce the death rate from opioid use disorder by half or more—methadone and buprenorphine—are themselves controlled substances. During an overdose crisis that is now driven by the illegal manufacturing and sale of fentanyl and other powerful synthetic opioids, experts agree that it is essential to make these medications more easily available.\r\nBut the Drug Enforcement Administration tends to see addiction clinics with few restrictions as pill mills. If a person with addiction can visit a doctor and get controlled substances without frequent urine testing, without the requirement of abstinence from other substances and without mandatory counseling, law enforcement may view that physician as a drug dealer, not a doctor.\r\nResearch, however, shows that even without these requirements—which often deter people from seeking needed help—the medications themselves save lives. The Supreme Court held over a different doctor’s case related to this issue so it can be reconsidered in light of the decision they make on Ruan and Kahn’s case.\r\nSometimes the difference between dealing and doctoring is obvious. If a physician sells controlled drugs for a fee (“doses for dollars”) without even the pretense of an examination or consideration of medical issues, or if a doctor trades drugs for sex or controlled substances for illegal drugs, it is clearly a crime.\r\nThis distinction is essentially written into the relevant law: for a prescription for a controlled substance to be legal, it “must be issued for a legitimate medical purpose by a practitioner acting in the usual course of professional practice.”\r\nBut aggressive prosecutions during the overdose crisis have blurred the lines between criminal behavior and malpractice. Courts have convicted physicians—including, their lawyers argue, Ruan and Kahn—for prescribing medication to more patients and in higher doses than other doctors do, not for deliberate dealing.\r\nProsecutors have based their cases in part on guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2016, and they have argued successfully that dosing outside the amounts mentioned in the guidelines is “not a legitimate medical purpose.”\r\n“We saw prosecutors using the CDC guidelines as evidence for their expert witnesses,” says Ronald Chapman, an attorney who specializes in defending physicians accused of improperly prescribing drugs.\r\n“The government would target physicians for prosecution based on the amount of medication they were prescribing—not on patient outcomes or sort of general factors of dangerousness to the patient population,” Chapman adds, explaining that by searching through prescription-monitoring databases, law enforcement can simply designate the doctor who prescribed the most opioids to patients in a particular city or state as a criminal. “The doctors who ended up with the largest target on their back were the pain management professionals who were taking the most problematic patients,” he says.\r\nKate Nicholson is an attorney, person with personal experience of chronic pain and founder of the National Pain Advocacy Center, a nonprofit that does not accept industry funding. “The reason we got involved is because we’ve seen a chilling effect on patient care where doctors are not willing to exercise even their best medical judgment because they fear oversight,” says Nicholson, whose group filed an amicus brief in the Ruan case.\r\n“It causes a race to the bottom,” Chapman says, explaining how pain specialists have abandoned patients or unilaterally cut their doses in order to avoid legal scrutiny. Nicholson and her fellow advocates say they hear frequently from patients who are in extreme distress because medications they have been prescribed safely for years were suddenly taken away.\r\nIn this particular case, the government contends that “a doctor who makes a mistake in construing or applying those standards is not criminally liable so long as he has made an objectively reasonable good-faith effort to learn and comply with medical norms. A doctor who fails to take even that modest step, however, has abandoned the medical profession altogether and cannot seek its shelter.” And, it argues, that is what these defendants did.\r\nBut the defendants—and amicus briefs from pain patient advocates, such as Nicholson’s organization, and others such as the Chamber of Commerce—argue that it is wrong to criminalize merely departing from the standard of care. If doctors believe they are practicing medicine and helping their patients, they should not be accused of being drug dealers subject to decades in prison. If the problem is that they are bad doctors, medical boards and malpractice charges can stop them from doing harm.\r\nBecause circuit courts are split on this critical question, the Supreme Court chose to take these two doctors’ cases and combine them into one to address it. Ideally, it will decide that convicting doctors for dealing does require mens rea—a guilty mind—and that a good-faith defense must be allowed when these cases are tried.\r\nThe CDC is also revising its 2016 guidelines, having recognized that their rigid application by physicians and use by prosecutors to target doctors is harming patients. (Comments on the new guidelines will be open until April 11.)\r\nI hope these actions will begin to put an end to the enormous damage currently being done to people with chronic pain who require opioids.\r\nThe conservative majority on the Supreme Court is, unusually, likely to benefit the defendants in this case. Conservative jurisprudence tends to favor mens rea requirements for businesspeople charged with crimes. With the Supreme Court’s help, perhaps America can finally find a true balance between restricting the use of potentially dangerous drugs and allowing those who benefit from them to have appropriate access.': ""{'PERSON': ['Xiulu Ruan', 'Shakeel Kahn', 'Ronald Chapman', 'Kate Nicholson'], 'DATE': ['March 1', '1999 and 2010', '2007 and 2017', 'between 2011 and 2020'], 'LOC': ['U.S.', 'Alabama', 'Wyoming and Arizona'], 'ORG': ['Supreme Court', 'Drug Enforcement Administration', 'National Pain Advocacy Center', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Chamber of Commerce'], 'PROGRAMS': ['None'], 'IMPACT': ['scaring many doctors away from prescribing opioids', 'restrictions on prescription opioids have not reduced overdose deaths', 'has had a harmful effect on pain care']}""}"

Pain treatment cost $261 billion to $300 billion in 2010, and the cost has only grown.\xa0Add the value of days of work missed, hours of work lost and lower wages, and the total price of pain exceeds the cost of managing\xa0heart disease\xa0and cancer combined.\r\nTo better understand America\'s pain problem, USA TODAY spoke with more than 50 pain experts anesthesiologists, neurologists, psychologists, geneticists and people living with chronic pain. The reporting resulted in this\xa0five-part series exploring\xa0the reality of pain, pain medications,\xa0nondrug alternatives for children and adults, and scientific advances offering hope for the future.\r\nThe vast majority of chronic pain patients will have stories about providers who have been dismissive, said Dr. Tina\xa0Doshi, a pain expert at the\xa0Johns Hopkins\xa0University School of Medicine.\r\nThey are told their pain is imagined, all in their head. But advanced brain imaging has shown that those with chronic pain have clear differences in their brain activity.\r\n""They\'re not making it up.

""Their nervous system is malfunctioning or there\'s a chronic, persistent pathology which is driving the pain.""\r\nPain\xa0is often unrelenting.\xa0\r\nA new study of Britons born in 1958 and followed ever since\xa0shows that pain in childhood predicted pain in midlife.

Experts believe opioid addiction only increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.\r\nYet nothing else is as effective at treating excruciating pain. Efforts to keep\xa0opioids off the street have often gone overboard, experts say, depriving those in real need.\r\nPamela Bobb of Tennessee, has been in pain her whole life. She manages it with a combination of meditative breathing, diet, exercise, yoga and medications.\r\nTamara Reynolds, For USA TODAY\r\nPatients like Bobb and others\xa0say they shouldn\'t be treated as addicts looking for a fix, but rather\xa0as people with a serious medical problem that needs attention and support.\r\nRobert Kerns\r\nCourtesy Robert Kerns\r\nFederal guidance, updated last month, makes it clear that unless there\'s a life-threatening\xa0issue such as signs of overdose, doctors should not abruptly discontinue or rapidly reduce\xa0opioid dosages.\xa0After an earlier set of guidelines restricted opioid use even among those in severe chronic pain,\xa0an online survey of about 3,000 patients\xa0found 84% reported more pain and worse quality of life, and 42% said they had considered suicide.\r\n""Separate\xa0but related to the opioid crisis is the public health crisis of undermanaged pain,"" said Robert Kerns, an expert in chronic pain at Yale University, noting that every drugstore in American has an entire aisle devoted to painkillers. ""This is a very serious public health concern.""\r\nAfter Bobb gritted\xa0her way through her 30s and 40s, her pain eventually became unbearable. In 2004, her doctor prescribed\xa0high doses of opioids. She didn\'t develop an addiction, but she didn\'t like what the opioids did to her brain and how they made her feel like a victim. ""I wasn\'t really living. I was just kind of existing,"" she said.\r\nEven when opioids don\'t lead to addiction, as they do in about 10% of people, they have side effects. Terrible constipation is common, as are nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, powerfully itchy skin\xa0and feelings of sedation\xa0 sleepwalking through life.\r\nAbout five years ago, Bobb, a nurse\xa0now semi-retired, decided she needed to take a different\xa0path.\r\nNow, every morning\xa0she washes a small dose of opioids down with an anti-inflammatory\xa0""special little concoction"" for breakfast, stir-frying fresh ginger, rosemary, basil, lemon juice and three cups of spinach.\r\nThe meditation, diet and other strategies have helped her\xa0cut her opioid use by about 75%.\xa0\r\nAll pain medications,\xa0including opioids,\xa0over-the-counter painkillers\xa0and nerve blockers, blunt\xa0but don\'t erase suffering. They often become inadequate over time or even contribute to the cycle of pain and desperate search for relief. Misused, every drug treatment\xa0can\xa0destroy\xa0organs and lives.\r\n""A cold hard look at what we have right now should depress anyone,"" said Jeffrey Mogil,\xa0who studies pain at McGill University in Montreal.\xa0\r\nDr. Nora Volkow\r\nKeren Carrion, USAT\r\nBut just because a pill can\'t solve chronic pain doesn\'t mean people are doomed to suffer forever,\xa0said Dr. Nora\xa0Volkow,\xa0who directs the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The institute is part of\xa0the National Institutes of Health, which has spent more than\xa0$600 million since 2020\xa0on pain research.\r\nMany approaches help reduce pain, and many people, like Bobb, manage to live full, vibrant lives, despite\xa0a background of discomfort. Non-pharmaceutical therapies including physical therapy, yoga, acupuncture and Bobb\'s meditative breathing have been shown effective at helping people cope with pain.\r\nWhile providers can offer guidance, support and access to certain kinds of care, fundamentally, people need to learn how to manage their own pain, Kerns said.\r\n""It\'s really about reinforcing the power of the person,"" he said, ""once they understand how much of the experience of pain is within their grasp.""\r\nPain is an essential part of life. It\'s protective and aids\xa0survival.\r\nIn a classic experiment, squid\xa0put in a tank with sea bass are less likely to get eaten if they\'re already in pain. The suffering makes the squid hypervigilant.\xa0""Pain is there to remind you you\'re injured so you don\'t take crazy chances,"" Mogil said.\r\nIsaac Chiu\r\nHarvard Medical School\r\nPain can be protective in other ways, too.\xa0Isaac Chiu, an immunologist at\xa0Harvard Medical School, recently showed\xa0that pain triggers the gut to release\xa0mucus, which coats the gut wall and prevents bacteria and other factors\xa0from\xa0causing\xa0damage.\xa0\r\nMice bred to not have pain fibers in their guts have decreased mucus, which makes them more susceptible to inflammation and colitis, Chiu found.\r\n""I don\'t want to have pain, but maybe in this case, the pain fibers in the gut are protecting us,"" he said.\r\nBut pain is not just the result of an immediate crisis, a twisted ankle, a burned finger, a broken limb. Chronic pain is defined as suffering that lasts more than three months\xa0 longer than it takes that\xa0ankle muscle to be restored, the finger to scab over and grow new skin, the bone to heal.\r\nSuch long-lasting misery\xa0has what\'s called a psychosocial aspect to it. Of course, unrelenting\xa0pain itself is depressing. But if your life is a dead end with few prospects for improvement, you\'re more likely to feel chronic pain. That hopelessness manifests in physical suffering.\r\nHow some Americans feel pain at the extremes: constantly, intensely, or never.\r\nFrom intense, chronic pain to no pain at all, some Americans experience that sharp sense of danger in a very different way.\r\nIt doesn\'t mean the pain is made up;\xa0rather, what\'s going on in your head can magnify or mitigate the sensation.\xa0A busy life full of compelling activities can distract from pain; a lonely life spent on the couch can compound it.\r\nThe high pain rates in the United States have a lot\xa0""to do with just poor general health in our country,"" said Dr. John Mafi,\xa0a\xa0primary care doctor and\xa0associate professor of medicine at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.\r\nPeople who have few financial resources\xa0or are from disadvantaged groups or both are more likely to have poorhealth, which contributes to pain. Obesity can trigger arthritis and low back problems; diabetes causes neuropathic pain; bad circulation can cause painful\xa0blocked arteries. Mental illness and stress exacerbate all kinds of pain, such as chronic migraine headaches. Limited or lack of health insurance coverage compounds all these problems.\r\n""We love to talk about magic pills in this country, but we don\'t ask enough: What are the social, psychosocial\xa0and economic\xa0root causes of this bigger issue?"" Mafi said.\xa0\r\nThe human nervous system has its own painkillers. Put your hand on a hot stove and your body will quickly release a squirt to numb the pain.\xa0\r\nFor thousands of years, maybe even longer, humans have relied on opioids in nature to supplement that innate pain relief. The ancient\xa0Sumerians\xa0and Greeks knew all about the pain-relieving potential of poppy seeds. Civil War veterans became addicted to opioids.\xa0\r\nStories about opium and morphine use from 1900 ""read just like today,"" Mafi said. ""It\'s crazy how much of this repeats over time.""\r\nIn the 1920s and \'30s, the federal government passed regulations restricting their use. Then in the 1980s and 1990s, amid\xa0a growing recognition that severe pain was undertreated,\xa0the pharmaceutical industry reassured the public that new twists on opioids, like oxycontin, were less addictive than earlier forms. ""We fell for it,"" Mafi said.\r\nOpioids are properly used as third- or fourth-line therapies in patients who cannot function normally without chronic pain relief, he said. He trains residents to consider opioids after determining the underlying cause of the chronic pain, other conservative approaches have failed, and when a patient\xa0says their pain prevents them from climbing stairs, showering, holding down a job or taking\xa0care of\xa0their kids or grandkids. If such activities of daily living are impaired, Mafi said, ""we would be a\xa0little more willing to continue opioids or prescribe the opioids.""\r\nMillions of people, prescribed courses of opioids for pain from sports injuries and other seemingly short-term sources of pain, began\xa0taking the drugs long-term, needing more and more to receive the same amount of pain relief.\r\nIn the early 2010s, as awareness of the problem rose, doctors stopped providing unlimited supplies. In 2016, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended doctors ""deprescribe"" their patients, which led to unexpected consequences.\xa0\r\nDr. John Mafi\r\nAs it got harder to get prescribed opioids, people stopped trying to get it from their doctor and they started to go to the street. Thats when you started seeing a rise in heroin use and then later, illicit fentanyl use leading to a lot of the overdose deaths.\r\n""As it got harder to get prescribed opioids, people stopped trying to get it from their doctor and they started to go to the street,"" Mafi said. ""That\'s when you started seeing a rise in heroin use and then later, illicit fentanyl use leading to a lot of the overdose deaths."" By 2021, studies had\xa0linked aggressive deprescribing to an increased\xa0risk of overdose or death.\xa0\r\nIt used to take several years for a heroin\xa0addiction to lead to overdose and death. Now, with extremely potent fentanyl, people are overdosing as early as their first foray, Mafi said.\r\nThe opioid crisis resulted from aggressive promotion by pharmaceutical companies and others, overprescribing of opioid medications\xa0and\xa0a lack of investment in pain treatment research, Volkow said.\r\n""What the crisis brought to light is that we cannot continue to neglect the importance of research and facilitating the development of therapeutics for pain.""\r\nShe and other pain experts\xa0agree that there isn\'t much else to offer at the moment and that\xa0opioids are appropriate and necessary for people like Bobb, as well as for patients after surgery or trauma and those fighting the pain of advanced cancer.\r\nBut not everyone, even in the medical world, understands the correct use of opioids. Patients\' pain is often poorly controlled.\r\nBobb switched doctors after hers abruptly decided she shouldn\'t be taking opioids anymore. She\xa0now drives 110 miles each way every month to see a different\xa0physician\xa0and\xa0worries about the patients who\xa0can\'t make such choices.\xa0\r\nMany people ""don\'t understand that using opioids doesn\'t make you a criminal,"" Bobb said. ""There\'s a place for this. There\'s a usefulness for this.""\r\nJeffrey Mogil\xa0knows he\'s going against common wisdom when he says women are more sensitive to pain\xa0than men.\r\nBut the research is clear.\xa0""The evidence is as close to incontrovertible as anything gets in biology."" About 70% of chronic pain patients are women.\r\nJeffrey Mogil\r\nMcGill University\r\nDifferent genes and cells are involved in pain between\xa0the sexes. The immune system, the\xa0nervous system and the microbes that live on and in the body vary\xa0between males and females. ""It\'s just massively different,"" Mogil said, noting current treatments and drug\xa0development don\'t take account of that sex difference, with drugs often tested just in male mice.\r\nPain also differs by age.\r\n""The aging population has more sources of pain but the nervous system is not as healthy,"" so pain isn\'t felt as acutely,\xa0said Dr.\xa0Christopher Gharibo, a pain management specialist at NYU Langone. Older patients need less powerful pain medications. ""They\'re fine with physical therapy,"" he said.\xa0\r\nPain differs by race, too, though not in a simple way.\r\nChronic pain is felt pretty universally by all races, said Roger Fillingim,\xa0who directs the Pain Research and Intervention Center of Excellence\xa0at the University of Florida\'s College of Dentistry in Gainesville. But ""the burden of pain appears to be greater in Black individuals,"" he said, with more people of color suffering disabling pain.\r\nHistoric and current undertreatment of pain in Black people has been persistent and based on the false belief that\xa0they feel less pain.\r\nIn fact, Fillingim and others have found the opposite: Black people report\xa0higher levels of pain with the same stimulus and lower tolerance of a given pain stimulus compared with white people. Whether Black people need more powerful painkillers to get the same relief\xa0or just need to get the added stress of racism out of the equation isn\'t yet known, he said.\r\nCulture also affects pain.\r\nIn Mexico, people are rarely prescribed opioids, said Volkow, who grew up there, and the Catholic culture venerates pain as a way of proving faith. ""People\xa0are taught to tolerate pain at a level that is different from what it is in the United States,"" she said. ""There is absolutely a cultural element of how we manage pain and its significance.""\r\nThe indigenous Mi\'kmaq people, whose ancestral territory stretches across Nova Scotia, Canada, down to Quebec and into Maine, don\'t have a word in their native language\xa0for ""pain,"" and the pictures doctors show of grimacing faces to rate misery don\'t fit their experience.\r\nSharon Rudderham\r\nJohn Ratchford, Ratchford Photography\r\n""It goes right to the core of the disconnect,"" said Sharon Rudderham,\xa0a member of the Mi\'kmaq who is director of health transformation\xa0for the health organization Tajikeimik.\xa0""We\xa0are literally speaking a different language when it comes to pain.""\r\nProviders are taught to assess pain in children based on outward signs, such as crying and facial expression, but because of their history and negative experiences in Canadian residential schools, similar to American Indian boarding schools, many Mi\'kmaq, even very young children, remain reserved around doctors and nurses.""\xa0\r\n""As a health provider, if I\'m looking at children in an emergency department\xa0and one is crying and screaming and looking uncomfortable and one isn\'t, the one looking more uncomfortable may be triaged sooner,"" said Margot Latimer,\xa0a professor at the Dalhousie School of Nursing in Halifax, Canada.\r\nThe\xa0zero to 10 scale doctors use for patients to rate their pain\xa0can also be challenging, especially for those\xa0without\xa0much\xa0experience with the medical system, said Carmen Reneé Green,\xa0dean of the CUNY School of Medicine.\xa0\r\n""A zero\xa0to 10 scale makes great sense for clinicians, but it doesn\'t work well for patients in many, many cases,"" Green said, particularly those who have traditionally received substandard medical care.\r\n""All\xa0those histories come into how we perceive pain, how pain is assessed and how pain is treated,"" Green said. ""We\'ve got to do better.""\r\nAfter about 15 years of taking\xa0high-dose opioids, Bobb made an appointment with Dr. Wayne Jonas, an integrative health\xa0specialist in Virginia.\r\nHe taught her strategies to manage the pain that opioids weren\'t touching.\r\nBobb said her pain used to be at a 9 out of 10 all day every day. Now, it usually hovers around a 3. It\'s not gone, but it\'s not paralyzing either.\xa0\r\nAfter her light dose of opioids\xa0and anti-inflammatory breakfast, Bobb allows herself an hour to move.\r\nDepending on how she feels that day, she might go for a brisk walk on her treadmill, do yoga\xa0or meditate some more. Exercise, she said, ""helps\xa0me to be at that level where I can function well.""\xa0\r\nPeace, diet &amp; meditation: how one chronic pain patient has learned to deal with discomfort\r\nChronic pain can be invisible, constant, and unbearable. Pamela Bobb, of Eastern Tennessee, has never known life without it.\r\nShe drinks water throughout the day and notices that her pain is worse if she doesn\'t sleep enough.\r\nIf her pain does start to\xa0wear\xa0her down, Bobb takes a time-out in her favorite chair. ""My space, my corner, my view, and just bring it down. Just bring it down.""\r\nFiguring out how to do what was best for her body took about a decade of trial and error. Time, energy and attitude change are all essential, she said, plus prioritizing self-care.\xa0\r\n""The key is stopping, turning, facing it, feeling it in all of its glory. Feeling every aspect of it and coming up with a way to say:\xa0\'No, no.\xa0The pain doesn\'t win,\'"" Bobb said.\xa0\r\nShe wishes other people coping with chronic pain could have the advantages she\'s had: a good doctor, attentive nurses, the time and resources to take care of herself. And most of all, hope.\r\n""If someone can understand that having a sense of empowerment over the pain by learning everything you can to treat it, to control it,"" she said, ""maybe they won\'t feel as overwhelmed and hopeless.""\r\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com.\r\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

"{'Days after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, it made a much less publicized ruling on prescription opioids—one that was far more welcome in the medical community. In a rare 9–0 decision in Ruan v. United States, the court ruled in favor of several doctors who were criminally convicted of acting as drug dealers by overprescribing pain medications.\r\nThe decision gives physicians charged with illegally prescribing opioids a fighting chance against law enforcement by requiring that prosecutors prove that they had criminal intent, rather than simply having to show that their prescribing did not conform to standardized guidelines.\r\nConsequently, by making the law clearer, the decision may also give people with pain or addiction better odds of receiving appropriate medical care, especially if they have complex cases that may require unusual dosing.\r\nIn the face of a decades-longoverdose crisis that continues to escalate, doctors have become terrified that authorities will decide that their practice is out of line and throw them in prison for drug trafficking. Hundreds of doctors have been prosecuted—and thousands more simply decided to stop prescribing opioids, even when they thought the benefits would outweigh the risks.\r\nSumming up the case in his concurrent opinion, Justice Samuel Alito wrote, “A doctor who makes negligent or even reckless mistakes in prescribing drugs is still ‘acting as a doctor’ — he or she is simply acting as a bad doctor. The same cannot be said, however, when a doctor knowingly or purposefully issues a prescription to facilitate ‘addiction and recreational abuse.’”\r\nIn other words, the remedy for bad doctoring exists in civil malpractice law, not criminal prosecution, which should be reserved for intentional drug dealing.\r\nLower courts had split on a key question in these criminal cases: should the government be required to prove that accused doctors are aware that they have crossed the line from medicine into drug dealing—or should prosecutors only have to demonstrate that their prescribing so deviated from the standard of care for pain management that it was obviously criminal?\r\nIn the Ruan case, for example, prosecutors alleged that Dr. Ruan began prescribing large amounts of a particular brand of fentanyl, after investing $1.6 million in the company that made it. To the government, this alone proved that he was a drug dealer, but the Court took his case because his lawyers had argued that the jury instructions did not allow him to properly defend himself as having prescribed appropriately. (The Court didn’t overturn his conviction, but sent it back to the appellate level so that the lower court could determine whether he should have a new trial based on its ruling.)\r\nFederal law in this area is vague: it says that a prescription is legal if it is written “for a legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of his professional practice.” But it doesn’t define what a legitimate medical purpose is.\xa0\r\nNot surprisingly, when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published opioid prescribing guidelines in 2016, they were adopted as hard mandates. Afraid that standing out would paint a target on their backs, doctors have reduced or eliminated opioid doses used for chronic pain to conform to the guidelines—and have even prescribed lower doses to end-of-life patients because of fears of prosecution.\r\nNow, thousands of people are being left to suffer needlessly. Prescribing rates have droppedbelow those of the mid-1990s, before pharmaceutical marketing drove a massive increase. Between 2013 and 2017, the number of opioid prescriptions for cancer patients, who were explicitly exempted from the CDC guidelines, fell 21 percent, with the drop escalating after the guidelines were published. Even the CDC—including the authors of its guidelines—says that doctors have misinterpreted the guidance and done harm; the authors are currently updating the guidelines. Meanwhile, overdose deaths continue to skyrocket.\r\nThe chilling effect on patient care has been stark. Reports of suicides by patients who have had their opioid doses reduced or eliminated are so widespread that researchers are conducting a study about what led to their deaths. At least nine studies now show that patients who are forcibly tapered have higher rates of both suicide and overdose; in other words, in an attempt to reduce risk to these patients from prescribed opioids, we may be killing some of them.\r\nHealth care workers who are afraid that patients’ pleas for pain relief will result in legal trouble for them also tend to become callous and cruel. Earlier this year, former nurse Bill Kinkle says HE was dumped out of a wheelchair onto a hospital floor because staff assumed that since he had wounds linked to IV drug use, he must be faking his inability to move to get sympathy so he could get drugs. He says that when he finally got medical attention, the neurosurgeon told him that any further delay in care would have caused irreversible paralysis from the neck down.\xa0\r\nOne Harvard University addiction doctor reported being turned away from an E.R. within its medical system where he was asking for treatment for severe sciatica. The E.R. initially labeled him a drug seeker before staff recognized him and realized he needed care. If he hadn’t had his credentials, the situation might have turned out much differently.\r\nAs a journalist who covers this area regularly, I frequently hear stories from families of dying people who are not being given appropriate relief and from people who, despite other approaches failing, cannot get opioids for chronic or postsurgical pain, even while in the hospital. But now that the Court has decided that doctors have the right to defend themselves as practicing in good faith, the pendulum may at least start to swing back to a more humane form of pain care.\r\nThe decision is already starting to have an effect on physician prosecutions. The U.S. Department of Justice has dropped at least one case involving opioid prescriptions. And an attorney for one of the defendants associated with the Ruan decision, Ronald Chapman, said that in the case of David Lewis, who he was also representing, the judge had to adjust jury instructions just as the decision was about to be read. The next day, the jury returned a complete acquittal of all of the doctors on all counts.\r\nThe decision could also affect other cases where the government has criminalized the prescription of opioids, including those used in addiction treatment like buprenorphine and methadone. Research shows that expanding access to these medications is one of the most effective ways to reduce overdose deaths—but what looks like lowering barriers to care from a public health perspective can appear to be drug dealing by doctors to police. With prosecutors required to prove criminal intent, doctors who make getting addiction medications easier will face fewer legal threats.\r\nRuan, however, will not stop the prosecution of physicians who actually become drug dealers and sell specific substances for specific amounts of money or trade prescription drugs for sex; the Court rejected the government’s claims that having to prove criminal intent will make these cases impossible.\r\nUnfortunately, while it is easy to scare doctors into complying with what they think is the law, it’s a lot harder to liberate them from those fears. Let’s hope that the Ruan case will start to make addiction and pain medicine far more friendly to both doctors and patients.\r\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of\xa0Scientific American.': ""{'PERSON': ['Supreme Court', 'Justice Samuel Alito', 'Dr. Ruan', 'Bill Kinkle', 'David Lewis', 'Ronald Chapman'], 'DATE': ['None'], 'LOC': ['United States'], 'ORG': ['Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'CDC', 'U.S. Department of Justice', 'Harvard University', 'Scientific American'], 'PROGRAMS': ['Roe v.

The political committees of President Joe Biden and dozens of US Senate and House candidates have benefited from Elling\'s contributions.\r\nElling, a former McKinsey &amp; Company partner, is at the center of the firm\'s opioid consulting scandal that resulted in a nearly $600 million settlement last week with attorneys general in 47 states, the District of Columbia, and five US territories.\r\nThe New York Times last year reported that Elling had helped lead McKinsey\'s effort to ""turbocharge"" sales of OxyContin, an opioid drug marketed by client Purdue Pharma. It further reported that Elling suggested to a colleague that he destroy records that might implicate him in the opioid sales push.\xa0\xa0\xa0\r\nFrom 1999 to 2018, nearly 450,000 people died from opioid overdoses, including prescription opioids, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\r\nMcKinsey spokesperson DJ Carella declined to answer questions about Elling, but confirmed to Insider that the company had ""terminated"" Elling\'s employment. In December, McKinsey issued a statement that acknowledged ""a responsibility to take into account the broader context and implications of the work that we do. Our work for Purdue fell short of that standard.""\r\nIn federal filings late last year, Elling most recently listed his home address in New York City. For many years, Elling worked out of McKinsey\'s New Jersey office. At some point in 2020, the company\'s website changed to indicate Elling worked from its Bangkok office.\xa0\r\nHis company bio stated ""he is known for his creative growth ideas, ability to galvanize organizations behind growth strategies and performance transformations, and passion for bringing the best of McKinsey to solve his clients\' most pressing issues.""\r\nIn a paper Elling co-wrote in 2017 titled ""Innovating at the speed of the 21st century in pharmaceuticals,"" he stated: ""[T]he gains for winners are bigger than ever, and so too will be the downside for those who lose.""\r\nAccording to Elling\'s LinkedIn bio, he earned a law degree from Harvard University in 1992 and joined McKinsey in 1998.\r\nElling could not be reached for comment by email and LinkedIn messages.\xa0\r\nDemocratic megadonor Martin Elling\'s former bio page at McKinsey &amp; Company. The consulting firm confirmed it has ""terminated"" Elling\'s employment. McKinsey &amp; Company has since removed this page.\r\nMcKinsey &amp; Company webpage screenshot\r\nDemocrats loath to talk about Elling\r\nElling is the latest example of top-tier political bankrollers who suddenly became liabilities to the recipients of their patronage. That list includes Democrats Harvey Weinstein and Ed Buck, as well as Republicans Steve Wynn and John Childs.\r\nBut as Democrats banish Elling, they\'re loath to publicly speak of it.\r\nWhite House spokesperson Michael Gwin declined to comment on Elling, who contributed $50,000 to the Biden Victory Fund joint fundraising committee in July, according to Federal Election Commission records.\xa0\r\nMore than a dozen other Democratic political committees and officials to whom Elling gave four- or five-figure contributions during the 2019-2020 election cycle did not respond this week to repeated Insider inquiries.\r\nThey include the Democratic National Committee, Democratic SenatorialCampaign Committee, Democratic CongressionalCampaign Committee, and the campaigns of Sens. RafaelWarnock of Georgia, JohnHickenlooper of Colorado, and MarkKelly of Arizona.\xa0\r\nFair Fight, a political organization led by former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams that Elling last year gave$10,000, also did not respond to inquiries.\xa0\r\nA spokesperson for New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat to whom Elling donated $4,300 in 2017, directed questions to the New Jersey Democratic State Committee. It did not reply to Insider\'s inquiries. The Texas Democratic Party also didn\'t reply to questions about the morethan$2,500 it received in July from Elling.\r\nOxyContin pills.\r\nToby Talbot/ Associated Press\r\nWhat\'s the \'value of the headache\'?\r\nDemocratic political committees that have received money from Elling have several options for the cash: issue a refund, donate it to charity, or forfeit it to the US Treasury\'s general fund.\r\nThey can also do nothing and hope their political rivals don\'t use Elling\'s misfortunes as a bludgeon negative advertisements, scathing press releases against them.\r\nBut that\'s a risky proposition for political candidates, said Nick Daggers, a partner at the 1833 Group, an Illinois-based fundraising firm that contracts with dozens of state- and federal-level Democratic political committees.\r\n""You have to ask yourself: What\'s the value of the headache?""

"{'A friend invited me to her home for a birthday party. Ten of us will be there, she wrote. Im pretty sure weve all been vaccinated, so we should be OK.\r\nIt was the first invitation to an indoor dinner I had received in almost a year.\r\nSix other friends are planning a tropical vacation and invited me to join them.\r\nadvertisement\r\nArent you worried about Covid? I asked, feeling a bit nerdy for raising the question.\r\nNot really. Two of us have gotten both our vaccines.\r\nadvertisement\r\nWhat about the others?\r\nTwo have gotten one vaccine each, and the other two have been very careful.\r\nAnd this from another friend: I feel like I just got into Harvard Law School! she wrote. I just got my first vaccine! But is it now OK to fly if I wear a mask the whole time?\r\nThese people are struggling with the same questions about safety Im struggling with, having just been vaccinated. We are wondering how to change our behaviors and interactions, and understand just how protected we and the others we encounter are or arent.\r\nIn early March, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released guidelines stating that fully vaccinated people can visit each other or members of a single unvaccinated household indoors without wearing masks or physically distancing themselves. These clarifications, along with the fact that millions of Americans are now getting shots, are welcome news.\r\nBut how will Americans respond? In the next weeks and months, millions of people will confront myriad nuanced and complex individual choices which gatherings to attend, with whom, and how certain we need to be that we are indeed safe from spreading or receiving the virus.\r\nThe problem is that humans arent good at gauging risks.\r\nMaskless young people are now thronging bars. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott decided to fully open his state. As his decision indicates, many people may now also engage in risk compensation, in which they act in riskier ways if they have taken measures that they feel are protective. Seat belt use, for example, has failed to lower fatal car accidents, since drivers wearing seat belts then compensate and drive faster or less carefully. Sunscreen use has increased melanoma rates because users feel they can now expose themselves to more sun.\r\nVaccines are absolutely essential for stopping Covid-19, but they reduce not wholly eliminate the odds of being infected with the virus. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are around 95% effective at reducing severe disease, while the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is about 85% effective. Those are high numbers for vaccines, but not guarantees of safety. For every 20 people who receive the Pfizer or Moderna shots, one could still acquire Covid-19 and become seriously ill.\r\nCovid-19 and other viruses also mutate, sometimes rapidly. As billions of cells in millions of humans replicate the virus, its genetic material constantly changes, sometimes in ways that circumvent our defenses and vaccines. At least one vaccine has been found to be significantly less effective against one such mutation. Current vaccines may not end up protecting against all the new variants.\r\nScientists also arent sure how long the vaccines protections will last, and whether vaccinated individuals can get infected and spread Covid-19, even if they themselves dont get sick.\r\nThe human brain evolved to face simple risks, like whether a certain plant is safe to eat. But far more complex and nuanced dangers now fill our world. Neurocognitively, we commonly assess risks using so-called fast thinking, which is essentially gut feelings. As the anthropologist Mary Douglas wrote in her classic book, Purity and Danger, people tend to divide the world into the two realms of risky and safe what is dangerous and to be avoided vs. what isnt or essentially bad vs. good. Our brains see these dichotomies in black and white rather than shades of gray. We dont deal well with ambiguities or notions of relative safety, and like to think of situations as merely either completely safe or unsafe, rather than as partially or relatively safe.\r\nPublic health officials have long recognized such complex realities about harm and safety. To address them, theyve pursued so-called harm reduction strategies. The fight to control HIV is an example. Some people who injected opioids or other drugs into their veins shared needles, spreading HIV and hepatitis, which can lead to disease and death. Over decades, federal and state and local governments spent hundreds of millions of dollars trying to stop addiction, but with limited success. One solution to stop HIV from spreading was by providing clean needles a harm reduction approach. Although many states have staunchly opposed this tactic, fearing it would fuel addiction, it works in significantly cutting HIV infections and not fostering addiction.\r\nIn the months ahead, many people will face complex decisions with no easy answers. Though desires to feel safe against Covid-19 run deep, we need to accept, and adapt to, far more complex realities, like how comfortable we are that everyone at a dinner party has indeed been fully vaccinated and hasnt then entered a relatively crowded subway, bus, store, bar, or other area without a mask.\r\nThe CDC, Food and Drug Administration, and other federal, state, and local public health agencies, along with elected officials, hospitals, physicians, and medical associations, urgently need to work to enhance public understanding of these issues through appropriate public health messaging campaigns. These messages need to convey the complexities of risks: the fact that being vaccinated is not a 100% guarantee of safety.\r\nWe each need to remain careful. Research suggests that until the vast majority of people get vaccinated and wear masks and social distance when they should, Covid-19 will remain around us in schools, stores, and elsewhere.\r\nI got more information about the birthday party and learned that all of those attending would be fully vaccinated before the event. So Im going. I also decided to join the beach trip, but will drive, not fly, and will continue to wear a mask and social distance.\r\nI look forward to more invitations, but Im not sure how I will respond.\r\nRobert Klitzman is a professor of psychiatry at the Vagelos College ofPhysicians&amp; Surgeons and the Joseph Mailman School of Public Health, both at Columbia University, director of the universitys online and in-person masters of bioethics programs, and author of The Ethics Police?: The Struggle to Make Human Research Safe (Oxford University Press, 2015).': ""{'PERSON': ['Texas Gov.

"{'In 2021, the U.S. suicide rate returned to its 2018 peak (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023). In the U.S., there were 48,000 suicide deaths in 2021. \r\nRates of opioid-involved overdose deaths have reached unprecedented levels since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020 in the U.S., there were 68,630 opioid-involved overdose deaths, which accounted for almost 75% of all drug overdose deaths (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2023). \r\nInvestigating and addressing the nexus of these crises is a key priority area for research, policy, and service delivery to reduce the risk of suicide among opioid users (Bohnert &amp; Ilgen, 2019; Oquendo &amp; Volkow, 2018). \r\nWhat accounts for the relationship between suicide behavior and opioid use?\r\nUp to 50% of heroin users and 15% of prescription opioid users attempt suicide. Rates of suicide death in opioid users are lower, albeit still high, at 10% to 30% (Darke, Farrell, and Lappin, 2023). This suicide rate is higher than the suicide rate in the general population and on par with suicide rates among individuals with psychiatric disorders that carry the highest suicide risk. Conversely, in a recent study of suicide deaths in Maryland, opioid use was implicated in 12% of suicides. There are a number of explanations for the co-occurrence of suicide and opioid use. They include the following:\r\n<ol><li>Psychosocial features among individuals who use opioids and those at risk for suicide overlap. Shared features in these populations include: poor psychosocial health, including psychiatric and medical disorder, relatively (compared to the general population) high rates of other substance use, pain, suicide ideation, isolation, loneliness, and hopelessness. Importantly for suicide prevention efforts among opioid users, opioid use may instantiate risk for suicide behavior beyond that conferred by shared risk factors for both outcomes (Chesin et al., 2019). In the 24 hours subsequent to opioid misuse, the risk of a suicide attempt more than doubles (Bagge &amp; Borges, 2017). Taken together, a clear association between opioid use and acute as well as longer-term vulnerability to suicide exists. </li><li>Difficulties finding and engaging in treatment are also common among individuals with suicide behavior and/or opioid use and contribute to risk (Kline et al., 2023). Many suicide attempters who present to and receive treatment in acute care settings do not engage in outpatient treatment following discharge (Lizardi &amp; Stanley, 2010). Patients with opioid use disorder discharging from inpatient treatment are also unlikely to engage in continuing care to poor effect (Naeger et al., 2016). On the supply side, access to medications to treat opioid use disorders or otherwise specialized services to reduce or stop opioid use are often limited (Presnall et al., 2022). Providers with specialty training, credentialing, and comfort in treating suicidal patients are also scarce.</li><li>Shared environmental risk factors for suicide and opioid use include access to lethal means, e.g., prescribed or illicit opiates. </li></ol>Such overlap suggests suicide prevention among opioid users could be bolstered by targeting shared risk factors and treatment engagement, as well as increasing clinical training on specialized treatments to prevent suicide and opioid use.\r\nWhat limits our understanding and therefore ability to prevent suicide among those who use opioids?\r\n<ol><li>Misclassification of death and self-injurious behavior occurs. Unintentional opioid overdose deaths, for example, are hard to distinguish from opioid-involved suicide deaths because behavioral intent can be ambiguous or unknown. </li><li>An incomplete understanding of substance use among suicide attempters exists due to incomplete data collection and reporting of substance use by suicide attempt survivors. Such limitations undermine understanding of the magnitude of opioid-involved suicide behaviors. </li><li>Most current research on suicide and opioid use is cross-sectional, meaning study subject data is collected at one time point. This prohibits understanding of temporal relationships between opioid use and suicide behavior, as well as how and when factors associated with these outcomes (e.g., loneliness, hopelessness, and psychiatric disorder) contribute to risk. </li><li>It may be that only more significant opioid use (in terms of frequency or amount) or opioid misuse (e.g., heroin use or illicit use of a prescribed opioid) is robustly linked to suicide behavior. The lack of definitional consistency and specificity of opioid use undermines understanding of the link between opioid use severity and suicide behavior, and ultimately understanding of who among opioid users is at highest risk for suicide.</li></ol>What can be done to prevent suicide among opioid users?\r\n<ol><li>Lethal means restriction. In suicide prevention, lethal means restriction, i.e., removal or restriction of means to die by suicide, is done at the individual level, and is an effective suicide prevention strategy (Zalsman et al., 2016). At a macro-level, data show positive links between opioid prescriptions per capita and suicide deaths (Olfson et al., 2023 ). </li><li>Improved screening for risk and greater availability of specialized treatment targeting both opioid use and suicide risk. It follows from the relatively high rates of suicide behavior among those with opioid use that screening for suicidal thoughts and behaviors in individuals who present with current or past opioid use is indicated. While clinical workforce development in effective treatment of both opioid use and suicide behavior is needed, in the meantime, there are publicly-available resources, such as SAMHSAs TIP 50: Addressing Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Substance Abuse Treatment.</li><li>More research. Studying individuals who may be vulnerable to opioid use and suicide behavior over time would allow for better understanding of how to effectively prevent opioid use and suicide behavior. There are practical reasons why such study is hard to come by, e.g., availability, or lack thereof, of study subjects over time. But, ultimately, a better understanding of risk and environmental factors that contribute to risk will help mitigate the current suicide and opioid crises that account for over 116,000 deaths annually in the U.S. </li></ol>': ""{{'PERSON': ['Bohnert', 'Ilgen', 'Oquendo', 'Volkow', 'Darke', 'Farrell', 'Lappin', 'Chesin', 'Bagge', 'Borges', 'Kline', 'Lizardi', 'Stanley', 'Naeger', 'Presnall', 'Zalsman', 'Olfson'], 'DATE': ['2021', '2018', '2023', '2020', '2019', '2017', '2010', '2016', '2022', '2016'], 'LOC': ['U.S.', 'Maryland'], 'ORG': ['Centers for Disease Control and Prevention'], 'PROGRAMS': ['SAMHSAs TIP 50: Addressing Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Substance Abuse Treatment'], 'IMPACT': ['Returned suicide rate to 2018 peak', '48,000 suicide deaths in 2021', '68,630 opioid-involved overdose deaths in 2020', '75% of all drug overdose deaths', 'Suicide attempts in: 50% of heroin users, 15% of prescription opioid users', 'Suicide death rates in opioid users: 10%-30%']}}""}"
"{'Narcan, the nasal spray that can stop opioid overdoses as they are happening, will soon be sold over the counter. | Getty Images\r\n\n \n\n Over-the-counter Narcan is a big win for slowing overdose deaths. But there is more to do. A long-sought tool in the fight against America’s opioid crisis is becoming available later this year: Narcan, the nasal spray that can stop opioid overdoses as they are happening, will finally be sold over the counter.\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the change on Wednesday, a regulatory overhaul that patient advocates and community health groups have been pushing for. Emergent BioSolutions, the manufacturer of Narcan, said the product should be stocked on store shelves by the end of the summer.\nIt’s a welcome sign of progress amid America’s worsening opioid crisis. Nationally, nearly 107,000 Americans died after overdosing on some kind of drug in 2021, up from about 92,000 in 2020 and 70,600 in 2019. The majority of those overdoses involved opioids and specifically fentanyl, the synthetic opioid that is much more potent than heroin and has become ubiquitous in the country’s drug supply over the past decade, contributing to the increasing number of overdose deaths.\nNarcan, the first-of-its-kind spray version of the anti-overdose medication naloxone, is remarkably effective at stopping overdoses. The drug blocks the receptors in a person’s brain that are targeted by opioids, reversing the dramatic slowdown in respiration that can lead to sudden death. It works quickly, within two to three minutes of being administered.\nNearly 17 million doses of naloxone were distributed nationwide in 2021, according to a report from the Reagan-Udall Foundation on behalf of the FDA, continuing a surge in the drug’s availability since Narcan first debuted in 2015. Previous studies have found that the expansion of naloxone access decreased opioid overdose deaths by 10 percent or more in state and local jurisdictions that tried to make the drug more available.\nBut despite that progress, the United States has still been struggling to get naloxone into the hands of people who really need it. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly half of overdose deaths in 2021 occurred with another person nearby who could have potentially intervened. Public health advocates have also long encouraged the co-prescribing of naloxone and prescription opioids, but that’s still extremely rare.\nTwo problems have stood in the way of getting Narcan to people who may depend on it to save their life: stigma and cost. The FDA’s decision to allow Narcan sales over the counter could help to address the first, but may not do much on the second — with a current retail price of $50 or more, cost is still a factor. This week’s news is a step in the right direction, but far from the end of America’s battle to prevent drug overdose deaths.\nHow making Narcan available over the counter could help prevent overdose deaths\nBefore Wednesday’s FDA decision, Narcan was already available at retail pharmacies nationwide. Almost every state had issued a standing order to pharmacists, allowing them to distribute the drug to anyone who asks for it.\nBut that required people to be comfortable approaching the pharmacy desk and making that request, which implies that either they or someone in their life is abusing drugs. Some people also reportedly worried about the information being shared with their health insurer if they produced an insurance card, even though most insurers have been covering Narcan at no cost to the patient. They might also need to pay for it, and 20 percent of people with substance use disorder do not have health insurance, according to the Reagan-Udall Foundation. That means they would have to pay the full price in order to get naloxone.\nTellingly, out of those 17 million naloxone doses that were distributed in 2021, only a small share, about 2.6 million, passed through retail pharmacies. The other 14 million-plus doses were provided to patients by other medical providers, such as doctors and hospitals, or other groups such as health departments, harm reduction groups, first responders, schools, and community health organizations.\nMaking Narcan available over the counter, instead of requiring somebody to confer with a pharmacist, should help to reduce the risk that stigma will prevent somebody from obtaining the drug in the first place. CVS and Walgreens, the country’s two largest retail pharmacy chains, said they both plan to stock their shelves with Narcan as soon as the over-the-counter version becomes available.\nIn addition, convenience stores, gas stations, and other retail stores will now be able to carry Narcan. New York City is planning to set up vending machines with two packs of Narcan.\nThat should make it easier to put Narcan in the hands of people who need it. The FDA determined, as part of its decision this week, that Narcan is simple enough to be used with appropriate instructions on its packaging. Some experts do worry that the opportunity to educate users will be missed by cutting out pharmacists, so here are some general tips:\n<ul>\n<li>\nSigns of an overdose include a person being non-responsive, having slowed or stopped breathing, becoming purple or blue in their extremities, and their pupils becoming small</li>\n<li>To administer a dose of Narcan, lean the person’s head back and insert the spray plunger into one of their nostrils, then press to administer the dose</li>\n<li>After administering the medicine, call 9-1-1</li>\n<li>If the person does not respond within a few minutes of the first dose being administered, a second dose may be necessary</li>\n</ul>\nBut while the FDA’s decision should remove some barriers to naloxone access, it has not eliminated them entirely.\nThe barriers that still exist to getting Narcan to the people who need it\nThe primary obstacle remaining to naloxone access is cost. Emergent BioSolutions did not immediately say what price it would set for over-the-counter Narcan, but the drug currently retails between $50 and $100, according to news reports.\nPrevious research has found that costs as low as $10 can prevent people from buying medications that they need. That may prove especially true for people who are using — and therefore purchasing — illicit substances. \nAs one recovery specialist in Minnesota who himself was in recovery told the Associated Press: “There was no way I would spend $10 for something to save my life when I needed that money to buy drugs.”\nStakeholders convened by the Addiction Policy Forum suggested a top-end price of $20 per unit, with a suggested retail price between $5 and $20, in order to prevent cost from being a barrier to people obtaining the medication.\nHealth insurance generally covers Narcan for free or a minimal copay with a prescription, but health insurance does not typically cover over-the-counter medications. Public health advocates are urging insurers to continue covering the over-the-counter version at zero cost, but it remains to be seen whether they will. That would still raise the possibility that people will choose not to purchase the drug rather than alert their health insurer that they or somebody in their household is using drugs.\nUltimately, cheaper versions of Narcan and other forms of naloxone would help to solve the cost crisis and this week’s FDA decision may open the door for their approval.\nHarm Reduction Therapeutics has already asked the FDA to approve its naloxone spray for over-the-counter sales, and experts said the agency’s decision on Narcan likely opened the door for that product’s approval. Generic competition would also help to reduce the sticker prices for people purchasing the drug directly off the shelf.\nPublic health experts are also urging the government to make other forms of naloxone available over the counter. Liquid vials of the medication, sold with syringes, can often be much cheaper (as little as $4) than the spray version and, according to people who work in recovery, are sometimes preferred by people familiar with syringe use because of their drug abuse.\nSo there is still work to be done to make naloxone as widely available as possible. And the need is only growing more urgent.\nNarcan is more important than ever as fentanyl rips through the US\nDrug overdose deaths have been steadily rising for the past two decades. About 20,000 Americans died of overdoses in 2000, a fifth of the lives lost by 2021. Part of the problem is the proliferation of dependency, something that began with the over-prescription of opioids starting in the 1990s.\nBut the other problem is the increased potency of the drugs that people are taking.\nIn the mid-2000s, most overdose deaths were from commonly prescribed opioids, the most well-known version of which is OxyContin. People either took too many pills after getting a prescription because of an injury or chronic pain, or those drugs entered into the black market.\nBut by the 2010s, the opioid crisis started to change. Between the high costs associated with prescription opioids and government efforts to begin restricting their supply, heroin started to become the drug of choice. Criminal drug gangs seized on the opportunity to bring that cheaper alternative to America, as was chronicled in Sam Quinones’s 2016 book Dreamland.\nBy the middle of the last decade, commonly prescribed opioids and heroin were almost even in the number of overdose deaths attributed to them. But another culprit was quickly picking up momentum: synthetic opioids, the best known of which is fentanyl. Over the past 10 years, those drugs have become by far the most common cause of overdose death in the US. \n \n \n Reagan-Udall Foundation\n \nFentanyl is now the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18 to 49. On the same day as the FDA’s Narcan decision, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told a Senate committee that fentanyl was the “single greatest challenge we face as a country.” The drug is 50 times more potent than heroin but cheap to manufacture. Mexican drug cartels have been producing fentanyl and smuggling it into the US in increasing quantities since 2015, sometimes selling illicit pills for as little as $5 each.\nThat increase in supply has coincided with a growing number of overdose deaths every year, which accelerated even further during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation.\nSlowing that loss of life will be a long and multi-pronged project, covering everything from border security to criminal justice to public health. This week’s FDA decision is an important step in the right direction. But the work goes on.': ""{'PERSON': ['Getty', 'Reagan-Udall', 'Alejandro Mayorkas'], 'DATE': ['later this year', 'end of the summer', '2021', '2020', '2019', 'past decade', '2015', 'This week', 'Wednesday', 'the past 10 years', 'the past two decades', '2000', '1990s', 'mid-2000s', '2010s', 'the middle of the last decade', '10 years'], 'LOC': ['America', 'United States', 'US', 'Minnesota', 'New York City'], 'ORG': ['the Food and Drug Administration', 'Emergent BioSolutions', 'US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'the Reagan-Udall Foundation', 'CVS', 'Walgreens', 'the FDA', 'Addiction Policy Forum', 'Harm Reduction Therapeutics', 'Public Health', 'Homeland Security', 'Senate committee', 'Mexican drug cartels', 'Kaiser Family Foundation'], 'PROGRAMS': ['Narcan', 'naloxone', 'over-the-counter Narcan', 'over-the-counter version', 'over-the-counter sales'], 'IMPACT': ['has stopped opioid overdoses', 'finally be sold over the counter', 'decreased opioid overdose deaths by 10 percent', 'Help to reduce the risk that stigma will prevent somebody from obtaining the drug', 'increase naloxone access', 'Reduce the sticker prices for people purchasing the drug directly off the shelf', 'Help to solve the cost crisis', 'has increased the number of overdose deaths', 'has increased the potency of drugs', 'proliferation of dependency', 'within two to three minutes of being administered']}""}"

That would still raise the possibility that people will choose not to purchase the drug rather than alert their health insurer that they or somebody in their household is using drugs.\nUltimately, cheaper versions of Narcan and other forms of naloxone would help to solve the cost crisis and this week’s FDA decision may open the door for their approval.\nHarm Reduction Therapeutics has already asked the FDA to approve its naloxone spray for over-the-counter sales, and experts said the agency’s decision on Narcan likely opened the door for that product’s approval. Generic competition would also help reduce the sticker prices for people purchasing the drug directly off the shelf.\nPublic health experts are also urging the government to make other forms of naloxone available over the counter. Liquid vials of the medication, sold with syringes, can often be much cheaper (as little as $4) than the spray version and, according to people who work in recovery, are sometimes preferred by people familiar with syringe use because of their drug abuse.\nSo there is still work to be done to make naloxone as widely available as possible. And the need is only growing more urgent.\nDoes Narcan work against fentanyl?\nYes, it does.\nLet’s back up a little: Drug overdose deaths have been steadily rising for the past two decades. About 20,000 Americans died of overdoses in 2000, a fifth of the lives lost by 2021. Part of the problem is the proliferation of dependency, something that began with the over-prescription of opioids starting in the 1990s.\nBut the other problem is the increased potency of the drugs that people are taking.\nIn the mid-2000s, most overdose deaths were from commonly prescribed opioids, the most well-known version of which is OxyContin. People either took too many pills after getting a prescription because of an injury or chronic pain, or those drugs entered into the black market.\nBut by the 2010s, the opioid crisis started to change. Between the high costs associated with prescription opioids and government efforts to begin restricting their supply, heroin started to become the drug of choice. Criminal drug gangs seized on the opportunity to bring that cheaper alternative to America, as was chronicled in Sam Quinones’s 2016 book Dreamland.\nBy the middle of the last decade, commonly prescribed opioids and heroin were almost even in the number of overdose deaths attributed to them. But another culprit was quickly picking up momentum: synthetic opioids, the best known of which is fentanyl. Over the past 10 years, those drugs have become by far the most common cause of overdose death in the US. \n \n \n Reagan-Udall Foundation\n \nFentanyl is now the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18 to 49. On the same day as the FDA’s Narcan decision, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told a Senate committee that fentanyl was the “single greatest challenge we face as a country.” The drug is 50 times more potent than heroin but cheap to manufacture. Mexican drug cartels have been producing fentanyl and smuggling it into the US in increasing quantities since 2015, sometimes selling illicit pills for as little as $5 each.\nThat increase in supply has coincided with a growing number of overdose deaths every year, which accelerated even further during the Covid-19 pandemic, according to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation.\nSlowing that loss of life will be a long and multi-pronged project, covering everything from border security to criminal justice to public health. This week’s FDA decision is an important step in the right direction. But the work goes on.': ""{'PERSON': ['Getty Images', 'Reagan-Udall', 'Alejandro Mayorkas'], 'DATE': ['later this year', 'Wednesday', 'the end of the summer', '2021', '2020', '2019', 'the past decade', 'two to three minutes', '2015', '2021', 'Before Wednesday’s', 'this week', 'the past two decades', '2000', '2021', 'the 1990s', 'the mid-2000s', 'the 2010s', '2016', 'the last decade', 'the same day', 'the Covid-19 pandemic'], 'LOC': ['America', 'United States', 'US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Minnesota', 'New York City', 'Reagan-Udall Foundation', 'America', 'US', 'America'], 'ORG': ['the FDA', 'Food and Drug Administration', 'Emergent BioSolutions', 'FDA', 'the Reagan-Udall Foundation', 'FDA', 'US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Addiction Policy Forum', 'Harm Reduction Therapeutics', 'Homeland Security', 'Senate committee', 'Reagan-Udall Foundation', 'Kaiser Family Foundation'], 'PROGRAMS': ['Narcan', 'naloxone', 'Narcan'], 'IMPACT': ['stop opioid overdoses', 'pushing for', 'fight the opioid crisis', 'stop opioid overdoses', 'increasing number of overdose deaths', 'effective at stopping overdoses', 'reversing the dramatic slowdown in respiration', '10 percent', 'make the drug more available', 'overdose deaths', 'increase in overdose deaths']}""}"
"{""In one way or another, Thomas Gooch has spent more than 30 years struggling with illegal drugs. The 52-year-old Nashville, Tenn., native grew up in extreme poverty. He was first incarcerated in 1988 and spent the next 15 years in and out of jail for using and selling narcotics. “Until 2003,” Gooch says. “That was the first time I went to treatment and the last time I used.” Since then, for most of 19 years, Gooch has been trying to get others into recovery or just keep them alive. He handed out clean needles and injection-drug equipment—which reduce injuries, infections and overdose deaths—in Nashville’s hardest-hit communities. In 2014 he founded My Father’s House, a transitional recovery facility for fathers struggling with substance use disorder.\r\nBut despite Gooch’s long experience, the opioid epidemic recently has brought a level of devastation to the Black community that has shocked him. “I had never seen death the way I’ve seen death when it comes to opioid addiction,” he says. “There’s been so many funerals, it doesn’t even make sense. I personally know at least 50 to 60 individuals who died from overdoses in the last 10 years.” That staggering body count includes Gooch’s recently estranged wife in 2020 and a former partner in 2019.\r\nA million people in the U.S. have died of opioid overdoses since the 1990s. But the face—and race—of the opioid epidemic has changed in the past decade. Originally white and middle class, victims are now Black and brown people struggling with long-term addictions and too few resources. During 10 brutal years, opioid and stimulant deaths have increased 575 percent among Black Americans. In 2019 the overall drug overdose death rate among Black people exceeded that of whites for the first time: 36.8 versus 31.6 per 100,000. And with the addition of fentanyl, the synthetic opioid that’s 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine, Black men older than 55 who survived for decades with a heroin addiction are dying at rates four times greater than people of other races in that age group.\r\nThe reasons for this dramatic change come down to racial inequities. Research shows that Black people have a harder time getting into treatment programs than white people do, and Black people are less likely to be prescribed the gold standard medications for substance use therapy. “If you are a Black person and have an opioid use disorder, you are likely to receive treatment five years later than if you’re a white person,” says Nora D. Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse at the National Institutes of Health. “Treatments are extraordinarily useful in terms of preventing overdose death so you can actually recover. Five years can make the difference between being alive or not.” Black people with substance use problems are afraid of being caught up in a punitive criminal justice system and are less likely to have insurance good enough to allow them to seek help on their own. And the COVID pandemic disrupted many recovery and harm-reduction services, particularly for people of color.\r\nGooch blames straight-out racial discrimination in the health-care system, too. “When we call different places to try to get people into treatment, the question they ask is ‘What drug do they use?’” he recounts with exasperation. “If you say ‘crack,’ all of a sudden they ain’t got no bed available. If you say opioids and heroin, they will find a bed because that’s the demographic they want. A couple of times I told patients that the only way they’re going to get help is to get drunk and turn themselves into Vanderbilt Hospital because Vanderbilt will hold them for five days, and that’ll get them into treatment.”\r\nGooch is one of the people trying to improve access to therapies for addiction and change the overall dysfunctional dynamic. Other groups are bringing more effective addiction treatments within prison walls, reducing the chances of recidivism on release. A proposed federal law would make therapy with the commonly used addiction medication methadone less onerous for an impoverished population, as well as less stigmatizing. And Volkow is using her platform at the NIH to highlight the overwhelming research-based evidence for better ways to understand and treat addiction.\r\nLoftin Wilson, program manager for the NC Harm Reduction Coalition in Durham, N.C., uses his van (first image) to reach people with substance use disorders. He gives out supplies, including opioid overdose rescue kits (forth image), safe single-use cookers for drug injections (third image), and condoms (second image). Credit:\xa0Gioncarlo Valentine\r\nAccess to Treatment\r\nThe nation’s historic reluctance to treat addiction as a health-care issue rather than a criminal justice one has resulted in a health-care system where too few people of any race—just 10 percent—receive treatment for substance use disorder. Several factors, such as stigma and an inability to afford or access care, make the numbers considerably more dismal among people of color. Even after a nonfatal overdose, Black patients are half as likely to be referred to or access treatment as non-Hispanic white patients, according to federal government data.\r\nA growing recognition that criminalization and incarceration do little to curb illegal drug use or improve public health or safety has led to harm-reduction policies such as Good Samaritan laws—statutes that provide limited immunity for low-level drug violations and increase availability of naloxone, a drug that can reverse overdose. But racial disparities have emerged in the application and effectiveness of both measures. A study from RTI International found that Black and Latino intravenous drug users have inequitable access to the medication.\r\nYvonne Alloway, who has opioid use disorder, sits in her doctor's Washington, D.C., office after being treated with Suboxone. The medication reduces dependence on opioids and decreases the severity of withdrawal symptoms. Credit:\xa0Gioncarlo Valentine\r\nLoftin Wilson, program manager for the NC Harm Reduction Coalition in Durham, N.C., who has worked in the field for more than a decade, says the problems with inequality lead to distrust in the system, which creates a vicious cycle in which people who need help won’t go to institutions that can provide help. People entering treatment worry, with good reason, that dealing with the social service system can cause them to lose their employment, housing or even custody of their children. “That’s another example of the negative experiences people who use drugs have. They definitely don’t land equally on everybody, and people don’t experience them all the same way. It is a vastly different experience to be a Black drug user seeking health care than for a white person,” Wilson says.\r\nUniversity of Cincinnati psychologist Kathleen Burlew notes, as Volkow does, that when Black patients enter treatment, they are more likely to do so later than white people and are less likely to complete it. In addition to mistrust, she says, the less favorable outcomes result from factors such as clinician bias and lack of racial and ethnic diversity among treatment providers.\r\nFederal resources, such as grants to support local opioid use disorder clinics and programs, also tend to favor white populations. According to 2021 data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 77 percent of the clients treated with grant funding were white, 12.9 percent were Black and 2.8 percent were Native American. The disparity is even more pronounced in some states. For example, in 2019 North Carolina announced that white people made up 88 percent of those served by its $54-million federal grant, compared with 7.5 percent for Black people. Native Americans accounted for less than 1 percent of those served.\r\nMedication Inequality\r\nResearch has shown that there is a bias among health-care providers against using medication-assisted treatment (MAT), which combines FDA-approved drugs with counseling and behavioral therapies. Substance use specialists consider it the best approach to the opioid use problem. Yet a study published in JAMA Network found that about 40 percent of the 368 U.S. residential drug programs surveyed did not offer MAT, and 21 percent actively discouraged people from using it. Many addiction treatment programs are faith-based and see addiction as a moral problem, which leads to the conclusion that relying on medication for abstinence or sobriety simply trades one form of addiction for another. Many general practitioners who lack training in addiction medicine have this misconception.\r\nThe three medications approved by the FDA are buprenorphine, methadone and naltrexone. Buprenorphine and methadone are synthetic opioids that block brain opioid receptors and reduce both cravings and withdrawal. Naltrexone is a postdetox monthly injectable that blocks the effects of opioids. Very few insurance providers in the U.S. cover all three medications, and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the full range of medications is far less available to Black people.\r\nResearch suggests that economics and race influence who receives which medications. Buprenorphine, for instance, is more widely available in counties with predominantly white communities, whereas methadone clinics are usually located in poor communities of color.\r\nCredit: Jen Christiansen (charts); “Evaluation of Increases in Drug Overdose Mortality Rates in the US by Race and Ethnicity before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic,” by Joseph R. Friedman and Helena Hansen, in JAMA Psychiatry, Vol. 79; March 2022 (drug overdose data); “African Americans Now Outpace Whites in Opioid-Involved Overdose Deaths: A Comparison of Temporal Trends from 1999 to 2018,” by Debra Furr-Holden et al., in Addiction, Vol. 116; March 2021 (opioid-involved death rate data)\r\nTo use methadone, patients must make daily visits to a clinic to receive and take the medication under the supervision of a practitioner. This requirement makes it difficult to do things that build a normal life, such as attending school and obtaining and maintaining a job. There is also the stigma of standing in a public line known to everyone passing by as a queue for addiction treatment. “The treatment model was developed [during the Nixon administration] based on racism and a stigmatized view of people with addiction without any thought of privacy or dignity or treating addiction like a health problem,” says Andrew Kolodny, medical director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative at Brandeis University. The stigma is made worse by methadone’s classification as a Schedule II controlled substance, which is defined as a substance with a high potential for abuse, potentially leading to severe psychological or physical dependence. This categorization pushed the medication into a quasicriminalized status and the clinics into minority communities.\r\nBuprenorphine, however, is a completely different story. When opioid use problems increased in white communities, Congress acted to create less stigmatizing treatment options. The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (“DATA 2000”) lifted an 86-year ban that prevented treating opioid addiction with narcotic medications such as buprenorphine, which today is sold under the brand names Subutex and Suboxone. The majority of doctors who got special federal licenses to prescribe it accept only commercial health insurance and cash, so the drug is usually offered to a more affluent population, which in the U.S. means white people. About 95 percent of buprenorphine patients are white, and 34 percent have private insurance, according to a national study of data through 2015.\r\nJohn Woodyear is an addiction treatment specialist in Troy, a small rural town in south central North Carolina where the epidemic is exacting an increasingly heavy toll on the Black and Native American populations. Overall overdose death rates increased 40 percent from 2019 to 2020, but death rates among those two groups in particular went up 66 and 93 percent, respectively. Yet Woodyear, who is Black and practices in a town that is 31 percent Black, says his patients are 90 percent white. People come to the clinic through word of mouth or referrals from friends. As long as Woodyear’s patients are mostly white, new patients will be mostly white as well, he says.\r\nOne exception to this racial pattern is Edwin Chapman’s clinic in the Northeast neighborhood of Washington, D.C., one of the district’s predominantly Black and most impoverished communities. Chapman, a physician, often prescribes buprenorphine to his patients with opioid use problems, and the overwhelming majority of them are Black. He says that to prescribe the drug, physicians like him must get past certain roadblocks. “The insurance companies in many states put more restrictions on patients in an urban setting, such as requiring prior authorization for addiction treatment,” he says. Further, “to increase the dose above 16 or 24 milligrams, you may have to get a prior authorization. The dosing standards were based on the white population and people who were addicted to pills. Our surviving Black population often needs a higher dose of buprenorphine.”\r\nEdward Chapman, a doctor in Washington, D.C., treats patients with opioid use disorder in his office. He offers them medication-assisted treatment such as buprenorphine, which blocks opioid receptors in the brain. Credit:\xa0Gioncarlo Valentine\r\nChapman says few physicians in private practice are willing to treat these patients. “They don’t really feel comfortable having these patients in their office, or they aren’t really prepared to deal with the economic and mental health issues that come with this population,” he explains; those disorders include bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, among others.\r\nPeople have their own biases that keep them away from medication such as buprenorphine, Wilson says. Many view it as simply trading one drug for another. “They think, ‘If I’m going to take this step, why not just go to detox and not take any medications at all?’” he says. “There’s a big cultural misunderstanding about the fact that [these] medications are the only evidence-based treatment for opioid use disorder. Short-term detox isn’t the most appropriate intervention for most people.”\r\nGooch agrees that the bias is real. He facilitates recovery groups at a program operated by a group from Meharry Medical College, a historically Black institution. Yet “I haven’t seen one Black person yet,” Gooch says. “Some think it’s a setup. There’s so much distrust, they have a hard time thinking it’s legal. It’s just the culture of Black people. Many are religious and think [taking the drug] is wrong.”\r\n“Those [misconceptions] are holdovers from our having been miseducated from the outset,” Chapman says. “Whites have done a tremendous job educating their community that this is a medical problem, a disease. In the African American community, drug addiction has always been and continues to be seen as a moral problem, and incarceration was the treatment.”\r\nHope for Change\r\nIn the November 2021 issue of Neuropsychopharmacology, Volkow argued that it is long past time for a new approach to drug addiction that would address these misconceptions within the most affected populations and biases among providers. “We have known for decades that addiction is a medical condition—a treatable brain disorder—not a character flaw or a form of social deviance,” she wrote.\r\nVolkow argues that treatment reform should start with prison and the criminal justice system. Even though there is no difference along racial lines in who uses illegal drugs, Black people nonetheless were arrested for drug offenses at five times the rate of white people in 2016. The racial disproportionality in incarcerated drug offenders does not reflect higher rates of drug law violations, only higher rates of arrest among racial and ethnic minorities. Currently the number of arrests for heroin (which more Black people use) exceeds the arrests for diverted prescription opioids (which more white people use), even though the latter is more prevalent.\r\nGooch (right) sits in the kitchen of My Father's House, a recovery facility he founded in Nashville, alongside Charles Gordon, a resident. Gooch says the health-care system discriminates against the Black population, and Black people with addiction problems have difficulty getting treatment from private doctors and hospitals. Credit:\xa0Gioncarlo Valentine\r\nThese unequal arrests and incarcerations add to the racial inequalities in drug treatment and survival rates. An estimated two thirds of people in U.S. correctional settings have a diagnosable substance use disorder, and approximately 95 percent will relapse after their release. In the two weeks postrelease, the risk of overdose increases more than 100-fold, and the chances of death increase 12-fold.\r\nParadoxically, that makes prisons and jails—institutions with the most obvious and overt racial disparities—the places with the greatest potential to bring about effective change. Volkow points to a recent NIH study as proof that starting substance disorder treatment during incarceration lowers the risk of probation violations and reincarcerations and improves the chances of recovery. But only one in 13 prisoners with substance use problems receives treatment, according to a Pew data analysis.\r\nSome local programs have started to tackle some of these issues. In Pittsburgh, the Allegheny Health Network’s RIvER (Rethinking Incarceration and Empowering Recovery) Clinic opened in May 2021. Its goal is to reduce recidivism among people with addictions by providing care for the formerly incarcerated immediately on their release from jail, regardless of their ability to pay. Since opening, the clinic’s caregivers have engaged with hundreds of people.\r\nNew York City recently became the first municipality in the country to sanction overdose prevention centers where people with substance use disorder can use drugs under medical supervision. Two sites, one in East Harlem and the other in Washington Heights, opened in December 2021. They have had more than 10,000 visits and prevented nearly 200 overdoses by administering the medication naloxone.\r\nThere are other signs of change, too. California signed a law that requires every treatment provider in the state to provide a “client bill of rights” to notify patients of all aspects of recommended treatment, including no treatment at all, treatment risks and expected results. And federal authorities loosened methadone regulations during the pandemic. Instead of daily in-person visits, more patients were allowed to use telehealth consultations and take doses home. Senators Ed Markey of Massachusetts and Rand Paul of Kentucky have introduced a bill that would make that change permanent. Among other programs and initiatives across the country, these are an indication that drug treatment policy may be headed in a more equitable, evidence-based direction."": ""{'PERSON': ['Thomas Gooch', 'Nora D.

"{'Today is April 20th, otherwise known as 4/20 day or ""Weed Day,"" a day that has become associated with cannabis use across the world. But it also provides an opportunity to shed light on interesting recent research surrounding medical cannabis, some of which indicates that the judicious use of medical cannabis could help reduce the misuse of prescription opioids.\r\nUnderstanding prescription opioid misuse\r\nPrescription opioids are a class of painkillers often prescribed by physicians for people experiencing chronic pain. Such pain can derive from a variety of sources, including accidents, injuries, or military service, as well as from the wear and tear of everyday life.\r\nDespite their ability to dull and lessen pain, prescription opioids have many side effects; specifically, they can be addictive. This can lead to opioid misuse by unwary individuals who started taking opioids on a doctors advice in a sincere effort to control pain. One survey indicates that over 10 million Americans misuse prescription opioids. Such misuse can be very dangerous. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that opioids were implicated in around 450,000 deaths in the U.S. from 1999 to 2018, and around 35,000 Americans died from overdoses related to the misuse of prescription opioids in 2019 alone. Moreover, the misuse of prescription opioids can lead to severe impairments in areas such as employment, education, and relationships.\r\nImportantly, surveys indicate higher rates of prescription opioid misuse in men than women; men account for around 70 percent of opioid overdose deaths. Some research suggests that men are disproportionately driven to prescription opioid misuse to control pain incurred in dangerous workplaces such as manufacturing, transportation, the military, or law enforcement fields in which men comprise the vast majority of the workforce.\r\nSuch men may be prescribed opioids by physicians and become slowly addicted over time. This can lead them to seek greater dosages from their doctors or to try obtaining prescription opioids on the black market, contributing to more severe addiction and a downward spiral resulting in the aforementioned impairments and overdoses.\r\nCan medical cannabis help?\r\nA growing corpus of research indicates that certain strains of medical cannabis (particularly strains rich in cannabidiol) have powerful pain-killing properties and can be a beneficial agent in chronic pain management. Indeed, some emerging research suggests that medical cannabis can provide a much-needed alternative to prescription opioids and may even mitigate some aspects of the opioid crisis. \r\nFor example, one seminal research study showed that U.S. states with medical cannabis laws had significantly lower rates of opioid overdose deaths compared to U.S. states without such laws, implying that pain sufferers often choose medical cannabis over opioids when such a choice is available.\r\nThis is consistent with my own research on Canadian military veterans living with chronic pain. Many reported that they were originally prescribed opioids for pain relief but that the side effects became intolerable. Given that cannabis is legal in Canada, they decided to use medical cannabis instead, which brought many benefits. This is illustrated in the veterans own words in the short but poignant video below:\r\nThe way forward\r\nA solid body of research indicates that the misuse of prescription opioids remains a massive health and social issue in the U.S. Meanwhile, a related body of research shows that medical cannabis can be an effective pain killer and is a preferred agent for many people living with chronic pain.\r\nHowever, the medical establishment has been slow to integrate such knowledge into everyday practice, perhaps due to (i) lack of training in medical cannabis; (ii) enduring stigmas associated with cannabis use and cannabis users; and (iii) concerns about prescribing a substance of ambiguous legal status. All this implies a need for concerted efforts to destigmatize cannabis use and raise awareness about emerging medical research on the topic, with such efforts targeted at medical practitioners and other influential stakeholders (e.g., teachers and employers), as well as the general public.\r\nThis could help create a climate in which medical cannabis becomes an accepted and legitimate option for people suffering from chronic pain, providing an alternative to opioid prescriptions. This, in turn, may help mitigate some aspects of the opioid crisis.\r\nLets weed out the cannabis myths now.': ""{{'PERSON': ['None'], 'DATE': ['April 20th', '1999 to 2018', '2019'], 'LOC': ['U.S.', 'Canada'], 'ORG': ['Centers for Disease Control and Prevention'], 'PROGRAMS': ['None'], 'IMPACT': ['reduce the misuse of prescription opioids', 'lower rates of opioid overdose deaths', 'mitigate some aspects of the opioid crisis']}}""}"
"{'IN RECENT YEARS,\xa0underground chemists have increasingly made small chemical tweaks on known recreational drugs to skirt laws, creating novel designer versions. Instead of cannabis, for instance, these chemists could offer up\xa0XLR-11, or instead of PCP they might have\xa03-MeO-PCE.\r\nNovel designer drugs, also called research chemicals or legal highs, still produce physiological and psychological effects, though experts say that they can come with a slew of risks. Synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, for instance, are\xa0increasingly cited\xa0among the number of opioid-related deaths in the United States, which reached more than\xa075,000 this year. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\xa0synthetic cannabinoids\xa0can cause heart attacks, kidney failure, and, in some cases, death. The newer synthetic drugs are often poorly studied, too, and among the myriad substances available, many come with negative health impacts beyond those of their naturally occurring counterparts.\r\nWhile illicit drug chemists work on new formulas, governments around the world try to regulate and ban the drugs quickly after they appear. Many countries use similarities in the chemical structure of drugs like between fentanyl and its analogs \xa0to ban novel psychoactive substances, or NPS. However, the approach varies by jurisdiction. For instance, in 2017, the Australian state of Victoria banned\xa0all psychoactive compounds\xa0with a few exceptions, including alcohol, tobacco, and medicinal cannabis. Other governments scramble to track the output of a global network of illicit labs.\r\nThe current situation were in is more the whack-a-mole approach, said David Wishart, a computer scientist and biologist at the University of Alberta.\r\nTo help streamline the work, Wishart and his colleagues used a type of artificial intelligence called\xa0deep learning\xa0to create an algorithm that identifies potential designer drugs that may not yet even exist. The millions of chemicals identified by the algorithm dubbed DarkNPS could help governments stay one step ahead of their production, says Wishart. He and a team of other researchers\xa0published the work\xa0in Nature Machine Intelligence in November.\r\nWishart says that the algorithm could help law enforcement and forensic chemists identify novel psychoactive substances a process that could otherwise take up to several months. DarkNPS may also highlight beneficial new compounds for clinical use. And, according to Wishart, there is another advantage: Governments could go through the cache of hypothetical drugs DarkNPS developed and ban them, even before anyone actually produces or distributes them.\r\nAccording to a\xa0press release, some agencies are already using the algorithm, including the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime, the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction, and the Federal Criminal Police Office of Germany. (In response to questions from Undark, Greg Planchuelo, the database management development officer for the EMCDDA, said the agency was not using the approach, while the other organizations did not reply to requests for comment.)\r\nBut critics argue the proactive criminalization of drugs would do little to address the main drivers behind overdose deaths. Moreover, criminalization has historically been socially damaging: The war on drugs led by the U.S. government, for example, has roots in racism, and still overwhelmingly targets marginalized groups.\r\nAnd although the algorithm may be able to capture drugs that are relatively similar to their predecessors, it may struggle to predict drugs with radically different chemical structures, says Alex Krotulski, associate director at the\xa0Center for Forensic Science Research &amp; Education\xa0and manager of the organizations NPS Discovery program. In a practical sense, he said, nobody ever knows whats coming next.\r\nCURRENTLY, THE\xa0standard approach for identifying an unknown drug is mass spectrometry, a method that, in short, weighs the components of a compound, in order to determine its molecular structure. But this technique requires a reference to compare the results against a reference that might be missing when dealing with a wholly new substance, but that could be sitting on DarkNPS list.\r\nDarkNPS produced a list of 8.9 million compounds that could be created by altering existing drugs. To generate this huge number, Wishart and his colleagues deployed a neural network, a kind of machine learning that is loosely modeled on the\xa0human brain, and which is often used for analyzing human languages.\r\nSign up for Scientific Americans free newsletters.\r\nThe effort began in 2020, when researchers from the\xa0Section of Forensic Chemistry\xa0at the University of Copenhagen approached the team behind DarkNPS. The Copenhagen team maintains a database of known designer drugs called\xa0HighResNPS, a resource that medical staff, law enforcement, and forensic chemists can use to screen for NPS by providing references for mass spectrometry testing.\r\nThe DarkNPS team trained their algorithm using HighResNPS. When the work began in February 2021, the database had more than 1,700 entries of existing drugs sourced from around the world. While thats a relatively small dataset, the team was able\xa0to trick\xa0the algorithm into thinking it was looking at something larger. The algorithm then combined the HighResNPS data with the predictable rules of chemistry to draft a list of possible new combinations.\r\nAccording to Michael Skinnider, a co-author of the paper and a medical student at the University of British Columbia, DarkNPS works a bit like a human brain comprehending a sentence, but the algorithm uses atoms and chemical bonds rather than words and grammar. If I tell you The clouds are up in the you know the next word is probably going to be sky. Its not going to be phone, Skinnider said.\r\nThe team then compared their results against 189 new entries on HighResNPS, which had been added after the initial run of DarkNPS, and found that 93 percent of the new entries were among DarkNPSs predictions.\r\nSince reference data might not exist for very new drugs, mass spectrometry isnt always a good option, as identifying such a substance can potentially take weeks or even months of work, several sources told Undark. DarkNPS could provide this reference for a staggering number of drugs. As soon as a drug hits the market instead of three months, six months of arduous chemistry they could potentially identify the compounds in a matter of minutes, Wishart said.\r\nDARKNPS HAS SOME\xa0limitations, however. For example, while it may make accurate predictions, it cant provide any information about the physiological or psychological effects of the drugs. The algorithm could also effectively give illicit chemists a roadmap to new designer drugs. As such, DarkNPS is sitting in the hands of the\xa0NPS Data Hub\xa0 a joint effort between the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the U.S. DEA, and the Federal Criminal Police Office of Germany which acts as a database to aid in the identification of new drugs. It is not available to the public.\r\nThen there is the issue of the drugs DarkNPS will miss. According to Krotulski, there are two different ways NPS evolve on the market. The first happens with minor modifications: the shift from fentanyl to, say, carfentanil. Both are potent opioids, and quite chemically similar.\r\nBut there are also larger changes, Krotulski said. For instance, another powerful synthetic opioid called\xa0isotonitazene, which has shown up in countries including\xa0the United Kingdom\xa0and\xa0Canada, has a structure distinct from fentanyl. It would be hard to predict these larger transitions with a predictive tool like DarkNPS, Krotulski said.\r\nSome labs might not need DarkNPSs list. According to Planchuelo, many well-resourced labs, including some in the EMCDDA, use a different technique called nuclear magnetic resonance testing, which doesnt require\xa0reference material\xa0the same way that mass spectrometry does. Still, Planchuelo added, smaller operations, hospitals in less developed areas, and other organizations could still find the algorithm useful. I believe this is a game-changer for the majority of labs that might not have the resources we do, he said.\r\nThere is also debate about whether or not banning drugs is a good mechanism to reduce overdoses and other harms. According to Alex Stevens, a professor of criminal justice at the University of Kent, criminalization hasnt deterred people from using drugs. Further, the criminalization of drugs disproportionately impacts people from marginalized communities. According to\xa0an article\xa0by Ann Fordham, the International Drug Policy Consortiums executive director, Black people in the U.S. are incarcerated five times more than White people, and half of these sentences are related to drugs.\r\nIn a way, though, governments banning existing drugs may also incentivize the creation of NPS. Its not dealing with the fundamental problem, Stevens said, which is that people cant get legal access to the drugs they actually want to use, and so will seek alternatives.\r\nWHILE DARKNPS COULD\xa0help facilitate wide-scale illicit drug bans, some say the approach could hinder the development of new medicines by making it harder for researchers to study drugs that have potential medical applications. I would be surprised if there arent quite a lot of substances on that list that are already being investigated for their medical benefits, Stevens said.\r\nThis has happened in the past. In 2016, for instance, the U.K.\xa0banned\xa0a class of drugs called third-generation synthetic cannabinoids. Researchers were quick to argue that this class-wide ban would cover substances that already exist as medicines, such as the anti-inflammatory drug indomethacin. After the drugs were added to the Schedule 1 classification a particularly strict class in the U.K. pharmaceutical researchers looking at the compounds needed a Home Office license, which can slow or even halt research, as it is\xa0prohibitive\xa0both in terms of money and time. Ultimately, the U.K.\xa0amended the ruling\xa0to make it easier for researchers to continue their work.\r\nBoth Skinnider and Wishart said that its unlikely that DarkNPS will lead to the blanket banning of novel psychoactive substances, even if it might help stop illegal drugs. In part, this is because the algorithm is capable of identifying some useful compounds, too. DarkNPS could be used to find psychoactive drugs with medical properties, like the next stimulant for attention deficit disorder, or a replacement for methadone in treating opioid use disorder. And with the right training, the algorithm could help find the next generation of anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, or antihistamines.\r\nIt doesnt get bored. It can start thinking creatively, Wishart said of the algorithm. It doesnt need doses of coffee or a good nights sleep. It just predicts.\r\nThis article was originally published on\xa0Undark.

"{""Drug overdoses have claimed more than one million lives in the U.S. since 1999, most tied to illicit opioids such as heroin and the nonmedical use of fentanyl. Although people from all walks of life die each day from overdoses, poverty stands out as a driver of this staggering toll. The risk of dying from an overdose is 36 percent higher among people living at or below the poverty line, compared with people living at five times that line, a typical middle class income.\r\nThat’s why expansion of Medicaid, the state and federal health insurance program for low-income individuals, has been hailed as an essential policy to prevent this disproportionate suffering. Implemented in 40 states, Medicaid expansion is a pillar of the Affordable Care Act that extends its coverage to all adults living at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty line (equivalent to a yearly income of $20,120 for an individual). Health insurance can help tackle the overdose crisis because it allows people in need to afford substance use disorder treatment, and treatment is a highly effective way to reduce overdoses.\r\nSo far, however, Medicaid expansion has not fully realized its lifesaving potential for helping to end the overdose epidemic. One reason why is that it takes more than insurance alone to stave off overdoses.\r\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\r\nIn fact, our recent analysis of all overdose deaths in the U.S. from 2008 to 2018 found that Medicaid expansion did not prevent fatal overdoses among people facing poverty; the opioid overdose mortality rate was the same—about 14.5 deaths per 100,000 residents—in states that expanded Medicaid and in states that did not.\r\nThis was not the result we expected.\r\nSo, we dug deeper by analyzing nationwide data gathered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on people who inject drugs. We looked at 19,946 people who subsisted below 138 percent of the poverty line (Medicaid expansion’s eligibility threshold). Some of the states we analyzed had expanded Medicaid, while others had not, allowing us to compare individuals who injected drugs in states that had and had not expanded coverage.\r\nThese comparisons highlight a breakdown in a key pathway that should link Medicaid expansion to improved substance use disorder treatment and thus to reduced overdoses. In a sign of the policy’s success, we found\r\n that insurance coverage rates increased by 19 percentage points among people facing poverty who inject drugs and live in states that had expanded Medicaid, while rates remained unchanged among similar residents of states that had not. Moreover, we also found\r\n people experienced a nine percentage point increase in their probability of getting needed medical care if they lived in expansion states, with no parallel bump in states that did not expand Medicaid.\r\nStrikingly, increased rates of insurance did not,however, lead to increased utilization of substance use disorder treatment; we found\r\n no difference in treatment use across these two groups of people who inject drugs. Other studies have reached similar conclusions.\r\nSo, why might health insurance not be enough to effectively link people to treatment? First, the U.S. has long suffered a marked shortage of treatment slots, so insured individuals who want treatment may still not be able to get it. For example, residential treatment programs operated at 90 percent capacity in 2022, but about three quarters of the people needing treatment that year did not receive it. We need investments to increase treatment capacity, particularly in low-income and rural areas, which have been historically underresourced.\r\nSecond, even with enhanced capacity, Medicaid expansion can only substantially impact overdoses among individuals facing poverty if treatment providers accept its insurance. Unfortunately, in 2020 only 71 percent of treatment facilities nationwide accepted Medicaid. Residents of expansion states do not fare better; a previous study by one of us found\r\n that Medicaid expansion did not result in greater increases in treatment programs accepting Medicaid in expansion states versus states that had not expanded. Low reimbursement rates are a longstanding barrier to provider acceptance of Medicaid. In 2021, the national average Medicaid reimbursement for methadone treatment—a common treatment for opioid use disorder—was nearly half that of Medicare, the federal insurance program for people age 65 and over. This Medicaid–Medicare reimbursement gap was larger than that seen for other services, including primary care. To help ensure that Medicaid expansion truly translates into increased financial access to substance use disorder treatment, policy makers must increase reimbursement for providers.\r\nThese days, people with an opioid use disorder don’t have to rely only on formal programs for treatment; they can also access the pharmaceutical treatment buprenorphine through their primary care physicians and other health care providers. Buprenorphine is a highly effective medication to treat opioid use disorder that also greatly reduces overdose risk. “Secret shopper” studies in which undercover researchers pose as potential patients, however, have found that potential patients struggle to get appointments with physicians who prescribe buprenorphine when they disclose that they are on Medicaid. Increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates, bolstering buprenorphine prescribing among providers within federally qualified health centers (which provide care for low-income individuals) and expanding the role of telemedicine are three pathways toward effectively linking insured people in need to lifesaving treatment.\r\nFinally, even insured individuals who can access treatment may still not be able to use it because of oppressive policies. Methadone, for example, is a highly effective treatment for opioid use disorder that also reduces overdoses. Federal law, however, requires that only specialized clinics can offer it, and that patients must come in person daily for observed medication dosing. These mandates are contemporary practices of the war on drugs, which created barriers to care by punishing even public health programming for drug-related harms. Daily travel to clinics may be impossible for people who have jobs, for people who lack transportation and for those juggling childcare or eldercare. These barriers are common among impoverished people who use drugs, particularly those who are Black, Indigenous or people of color, or those who live in rural communities.\r\nDuring the COVID pandemic, the federal emergency declaration temporarily replaced these punitive policies with a more patient-centered model. Emergency policies permitted some patients to take home up to a 28-day supply of methadone. While this policy has remained in effect even after the federal emergency declaration ended, it is only temporary. The Department of Health and Human Services should make this policy permanent, and support states and treatment programs as they revise policies to support this federal change.\r\nOur study showed expansion was successful at enrolling people facing poverty who use drugs in Medicaid, and that it also helped them access needed medical care. However, our analysis also served as a compelling reminder that insurance coverage alone is insufficient to reverse the overdose crisis for this vulnerable population, because it is not adequately connecting those in need to substance use disorder treatment. We must bolster treatment to meet demand, expand program and provider acceptance of Medicaid, and permanently relax oppressive methadone policies before another million lives are lost.\r\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American."": ""{{'PERSON': ['None'], 'DATE': ['1999', '2008 to 2018', '2022','2020','2021'], 'LOC': ['U.S.'], 'ORG': ['Medicaid', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention','Medicare','Department of Health and Human Services', 'Scientific American'], 'PROGRAMS': ['Affordable Care Act', 'Medicaid expansion', 'buprenorphine treatment', 'pharmaceutical treatment', 'methadone treatment'], 'IMPACT': ['risk of dying from an overdose is 36 percent higher among people living at or below the poverty line', 'Medicaid expansion did not prevent fatal overdoses among people facing poverty', 'insurance coverage rates increased by 19 percentage points among people facing poverty who inject drugs and live in states that had expanded Medicaid', 'people experienced a nine percentage point increase in their probability of getting needed medical care if they lived in expansion states']}}""}"
"{'A door is painted with the message to stop selling heroin on a street in a neighborhood with a high rate of poverty and illegal drug use on October 14, 2016, in New York City. | Spencer Platt/Getty Images\r\n\n \n\n American policymakers should look beyond defeating the coronavirus. Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, there’s been a lot of talk about going back to “normal.” And while going back to a pre-coronavirus era would be a tremendous improvement for everyone, there are reminders all around us that it also wouldn’t be good enough.\nA clear example is America’s opioid epidemic. Before Covid-19, the US suffered a record 70,630 drug overdose deaths in 2019. That amounted to a 5 percent increase from 2018, and erased the entire drop in overdose deaths reported from 2017 to 2018.\nBased on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the crisis further worsened in 2020 — with an estimated 86,000 overdose deaths over the 12 months ending with July 2020. Experts say that’s partly due to Covid-19: As much of society shut down, so did places that can help people struggling with drugs, and more people were thrust into isolated conditions that may have pushed them to drug use and addiction.\nBut as the increase in overdose deaths from 2018 to 2019 shows, the crisis was once again on an upward trajectory before Covid-19. There are many possible reasons. But most notably, the highly potent synthetic opioid fentanyl has continued to supplant heroin in illicit markets, and with its greater potency, fentanyl brings a greater risk of overdose and death. Couple that with America’s inadequate addiction treatment system — which is very expensive and frequently offers substandard care — and you get an uncontrolled, worsening public health crisis.\n\r\n\nOne thing I really want to emphasize is that this isn’t because, as I often hear from readers, the opioid crisis is an impossible problem to solve. A solution isn’t easy — addiction is a complex medical condition, for one — but it’s not impossible.\nFor opioids, there are very effective treatments: medications like methadone and buprenorphine (commonly known as Suboxone). These medications have decades of evidence behind them, showing they reduce all-cause mortality among opioid addiction patients by half or more and do a better job keeping people in treatment than non-medication approaches. In France, an expansion of buprenorphine in particular was tied to a big drop in overdoses.\nYet the majority of addiction treatment facilities don’t offer any of the federally approved medications. Many of these facilities are instead built around approaches that have little to no evidence behind them — or, in the case of some, actually have evidence against them.\nPolicymakers could address this. They could boost support for addiction treatment facilities but tie that support to truly evidence-based care, as Vermont has done. They could integrate addiction treatment into the health care system, therefore tying treatment to more accountability and higher quality standards — as Virginia has moved toward through its Medicaid program.\nThe problem, though, is that policymakers across the country by and large haven’t taken the crisis seriously enough. They haven’t spent the money; even as the crisis became a truly national story during the Trump administration, Republicans resisted spending much. Many lawmakers still hold stigmatizing views of those suffering from drug addiction, fostering apathy toward the problem.\nIn other words, we know this crisis is happening, we know there are policy solutions to address it, and yet we haven’t. This was true before Covid-19, and it’ll be true after, too.\nThis is just one example. From gun violence to the racial wealth gap to climate change, there are many problems that were going largely unaddressed in the “normal” pre-Covid times.\nThe good news, with opioids, is that President Biden has a good plan to address the crisis — it was one of his few plans, in fact, that was actually more ambitious than the rest of the Democratic primary field.\nBut to get action on the opioid epidemic and other issues, the American public and lawmakers can’t settle for “normal” — we’ll have to go bigger than that.\nSign up for the Weeds newsletter.

"{'A woman with substance use disorder pauses under the bridge where she lives in the Kensington section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on July 21, 2017. Substance use disorder and homelessness are risk factors for syphilis. | Spencer Platt/Getty Images\r\n\n \n\n The trend is likely a symptom of failed drug, education, and health policy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a big chunk of the past two decades, sexual health experts generally thought of syphilis as a disease of greatest concern to gay men and their sexual networks. In 2014, more than 90 percent of US cases were diagnosed in men, the vast majority of whom had sex with other men. \nBut in 2015, that began to change: Syphilis began ticking upward in heterosexual adults, too — especially among women. By 2021, women accounted for about a quarter of new syphilis cases; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently released data detailing the dramatic rise. \nSyphilis causes skin rashes in its early stages and if untreated, in its later stages, can lead to complications ranging from neurologic problems to cardiovascular disease to death (in around 10 percent of cases). \nBetween 2017 and 2021, infection rates in women rose more than threefold, from two per 100,000 people to seven per 100,000 — a much larger increase than the rise among men, and larger still than the uptick in other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), like chlamydia and gonorrhea. (In absolute numbers, the majority of syphilis infections continue to occur among men who have sex with men, and their infection rates are rising, too. But that increase has been sluggish compared with the meteoric increase among women.) \nSyphilis is particularly concerning when it affects women of childbearing age because of the catastrophic effects it can have on pregnancy. Infections in pregnant people can lead to congenital infections in their newborns, placing them at high risk for stillbirth or severe disability. Indeed, congenital syphilis rates have risen precipitously alongside rates in adult women over the past five years. \nThe reasons for syphilis’s rising rates in women are complex. An unfortunate fact of biology likely plays a part: People with vaginas are more susceptible to STIs than those with penises. \nBut that anatomical reality, while extremely annoying, isn’t enough to explain why an easily curable STI (with just one dose of antibiotics!) is newly and uncontrollably surging among women. Rising syphilis rates in women — and their babies — signal that multiple societal failsafes have, in fact, failed. This is a big red flag that should provoke us to wonder what’s gone wrong, and to think urgently about fixes. \nHere are three theories for how social changes in the US might be contributing to syphilis’s shifting dynamics.\n1) Homelessness and substance abuse increase syphilis risk more for women — and those at highest risk are getting less of the care they need. \nAmong both heterosexual men and women, some of the biggest socioeconomic risk factors for syphilis include drug use — especially opioid, methamphetamine, and heroin use — poverty, homelessness, and transactional sex. Several of these factors have been on the rise in recent years, and they often travel together. \nAlthough these trends affect all genders, it’s among women where they most strongly translate into syphilis risk. Among youth, homelessness raised the risk of syphilis and other STIs far more in girls than in boys. And among people with substance use disorders, women in one study were nearly twice as likely to have transactional sex as men. That led to big negative consequences that fell largely to women: In the same study, people who had transactional sex were three times as likely to have syphilis as those who didn’t.\nMeanwhile, the safety-net sexual health services that are supposed to provide preventive care, testing, and treatment for uninsured Americans, including those at highest risk of syphilis, have dwindled. Since 2004, funding for STI prevention has fallen 41 percent, and many counties don’t have a safety-net sexual health clinic at all. \nThat means many women with the highest vulnerability and the lowest resources — and the men who are most likely to be their sources of infection — are facing bigger barriers than ever to getting tested and treated for syphilis. This is perhaps especially true in rural America. There, the disproportionate impact of the opioid epidemic raises the infection risk for a higher proportion of women — and the disproportionate closure of health facilities more broadly reduces their access to care.\nThe declines in sexual health care have been going on for decades: Nearly 18,000 women got STI testing and treatment at publicly funded clinics in 2018 — about half as many as in 2010. Simultaneously, more people are getting STI care in emergency rooms, where providers often altogether skip testing for syphilis, Irene Stafford, an OB-GYN and syphilis researcher at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, told me in an interview last fall. \nIn these settings, providers more often test patients for chlamydia and gonorrhea than for syphilis, she said, as they are more common.\nOnly about a third of women Stafford sees for syphilis infection complete their treatment, she said, largely because of a mix of socioeconomic challenges and despair. “We have patients who are already mistrusting the government, mistrusting health care, can’t get insured, the health clinics are closed, they’re being trafficked,” she said. \nSyphilis’s persistence and growth among women who are already so marginalized shows how poorly equipped the US health care system is for finding and treating disease in the most vulnerable Americans.\n2) It’s getting harder to access prenatal care, a key catch-and-treat point for syphilis.\nRising syphilis rates in women may also be linked to another burgeoning crisis: declining access to maternal health care.\nMost states require some form of syphilis testing during pregnancy. For that reason, prenatal care is an important tool for catching and treating women’s syphilis infections — and a critical opportunity for preventing these infections from leading to devastating effects in newborns. \nBut prenatal care is becoming increasingly hard to find. Rural hospitals with birth centers —which usually also offer prenatal care — have been closing at an astonishing rate, and obstetricians have been leaving rural communities for urban centers.\nAccording to the March of Dimes, nearly 7 million women of childbearing age have low or no access to maternity care, and the trend disproportionately affects rural parts of the South and the Plains states. \nThe lack of access is concerning considering that in 2021, one-fifth of women diagnosed with syphilis were pregnant. How many more cases might be caught if prenatal care access was closer to women in need? \nBut it’s not just geographic distance that forms a barrier to accessing prenatal care. In 2020, about 11 percent of American women were uninsured — and women without health care coverage are less likely to seek prenatal care. \nAdditionally, while pregnant women who use drugs are at higher risk for getting infected with syphilis, they face state policies that harshly punish substance use during pregnancy. \n“Sometimes people are afraid to seek prenatal care because of the consequences,” said Robert McDonald, a medical epidemiologist who works on syphilis prevention efforts at the CDC, in an interview last fall. \nTwenty-four states have laws on the books that consider drug use while pregnant to be child abuse. Several states go even further, allowing women to be jailed or involuntarily committed to rehabilitation if they are found to be using drugs during pregnancy.\nThe result is that women at highest risk for having syphilis — those with substance use disorders — often avoid the very system that’s intended to protect themselves and their pregnancies.\n3) School sex education is failing to give young women practical STI-prevention tools.\nIn an ideal world, people would learn how to keep themselves from catching syphilis before the opportunity to do so came up. But in many American classrooms, students are getting sex education that simply doesn’t prepare them to avoid STIs.\nSex education in the US is quite the patchwork when it comes to scientific accuracy: Only 17 states require sex ed content to be medically accurate. Meanwhile, 19 states require programs to teach that sex should only happen within marriages, and 29 states require programs to emphasize sexual abstinence.\nPrograms grounded in religious dogma rather than reality leave young people with more questions than answers about their bodies and about their own sexual health, and make many feel like they’ve done something wrong by being sexually active, or even having sexual thoughts. And their effects are particularly detrimental to young women. \nSo-called “abstinence-only until marriage” (AOUM) programs reinforce gender stereotypes about passive women and aggressive men. Studies have shown that women who buy into these gender roles are less likely to use condoms, making them more vulnerable to STIs, including syphilis. Studies also showed students who made virginity pledges had higher STI and non-marital pregnancy rates, and were less likely to use condoms and to be tested for STIs. \nStigmatizing sexual activity among teens — whether intentionally or not — also reduces the likelihood that a young woman with an STI will seek care for it. Because syphilis can hang around in the body for years before causing severe symptoms, that means the negative effects of low-quality sex ed in high school can lead to health problems that manifest well into adulthood.\nIt’s not like there’s no better way: Inclusive, medically accurate sex ed that includes education on healthy relationships and communication has been proven not only to reduce STI rates, but also to lead to lower rates of unwanted pregnancy. \nEffective sex ed goes well beyond teaching students the basics of sexual biology, said Michelle Slaybaugh, a former school sex educator who directs social impact and communications at SIECUS, a nonprofit comprehensive sex ed advocacy organization, in an interview last summer.\n“Students have to understand what it means to be turned on, what does pleasure feel like,” said Slaybaugh. “Then they can understand, when they are in those moments, how they need to move forward to safely protect themselves and their partners.”\nIt’s wildly unlikely that such a nuanced brand of sex ed will hit all the US classrooms where it’s needed anytime soon. \nPunitive, stigmatizing policies make the situation worse — not better \nWhat so many of the above trends have in common is that they result from policies attempting to incentivize desired behaviors by punishing or stigmatizing undesired ones. \nIt’s clear in the case of opioids, where the strict punishments for abuse keep people from seeking care. \nSimilarly, comprehensive sex education could actually reduce young women’s risk for syphilis. But a preference for programs that systematically stigmatize young people’s sexuality means many are deprived of the tools they need to negotiate safe sex. \nThese policies reduce women’s autonomy, their trust in health care providers, and their ability to get their needs met. Syphilis is just one signal of these punitive approaches’ harms — but it’s one we should heed.': ""{'PERSON': ['Spencer Platt', 'Irene Stafford', 'Robert McDonald', 'Michelle Slaybaugh'], 'DATE': ['July 21, 2017', '2014', '2015', '2021', 'Between 2017 and 2021', 'Since 2004', '2018', '2010', '2020', 'last fall', 'last summer'], 'LOC': ['Philadelphia, Pennsylvania', 'US', 'rural America', 'University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston', 'South', 'Plains states'], 'ORG': ['Getty Images', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'March of Dimes', 'CDC', 'SIECUS'], 'PROGRAMS': ['Substance use disorder', 'drug, education, and health policy', 'sexual health services', 'prenatal care', 'maternal health care', 'syphilis prevention efforts'], 'IMPACT': ['increase in syphilis risk', 'increase in sexual transmission infection', 'complications from syphilis', 'proportionally higher risk among women', 'decrease in preventive care and testing', 'neglect in syphilis testing', 'barriers to syphilis testing and treatment', 'declining access to maternal care', 'increase in syphilis rates among pregnant women', 'ineffective sex education leading to higher STI rates', 'stigmatization of sexual activity resulting in less care seeking behavior']}""}"
"{'Cammie Wolf Rice launched the Christopher Wolf Crusade (CWC) in 2018 in memory of her son, Christopher, who died from an opioid overdose. He became addicted due to the overprescribing of opioids for his pain after multiple surgeries as a teenager and young adult. In Cammie\'s experiences with her son\'s hospitalizations, not one health-care provider gave her family information about the dangers of pain medication. Her experience was the catalyst to conceptualize the role of Life Care Specialist and the need to add this new level of health-care provider to hospital systems nationwide. \r\nOpioid use and misuse are public-health emergencies, and innovations are needed to address the overprescribing epidemic. Neuman (2019) reports that the U.S. and Canada are two countries where opioid overprescribing after surgery appears to be common. Ladha (2019) finds that excessive postoperative opioid prescribing has been associated with increased risks of drug diversion, new long-term opioid use, and the development of opioid use disorder. \r\nIn the United States, thousands of families are grieving from losing a family member due to opioids. The Centers for Disease Control (2022) report that overdose deaths involving opioids increased from an estimated 70,029 in 2020 to 80,816 in 2021. Cammie\'s journey has been torturous and ladened with grief, and she is not alone. We at the Trauma Resource Institute, along with Emory University, Grady Hospital, Usher\'s New Look, the Cambodian Children\'s Fund, and Mercer University School of Medicine, have partnered with her and the CWC to try to introduce innovation to the public health issue of opioid addiction.\r\nDamiescu\'s (2021) review evaluated the risk factors associated with opioid overdoses. It investigated the rates of chronic opioid misuse, particularly in the context of chronic pain and post-surgery treatments, as those typically represent the entrance of opioids into people\'s lives. Damiescu (2021) stated that opioid abuse and misuse have led to an epidemic that is spreading worldwide and suggests that fighting it requires a structured public health approach. \r\nIn the immense sea of needed interventions to address the public health emergency of the opioid crisis, the Christopher Wolf Crusade launched, in conjunction with Emory University and Grady Hospital in Atlanta, the Life Care Specialist Program. Dr. Mara Schenker, Dr. Nicholas Giordano, and their colleagues have launched research titled, ""The effect of a Life Care Specialist on painmanagement and opioid-related outcomes among patients with orthopedic trauma."" Their preliminary results are promising.\r\nThe Life Care Specialist Program\'s goal is to establish Life Care Specialists (LCS) within hospitals nationwide. The LCS is part of an interdisciplinary treatment team collaborating on assessment and treatment. The specialist\'s primary focus is to introduce an integrated behavior-specific intervention during inpatient hospitalization to decrease opioid utilization and improve pain management post-hospitalization.\r\nThe Life Care Specialist Training follows a multi-modal approach. The training educates about the nature of opioids and the impact of opioid use, misuse, and addiction on individuals and families. LCS training includes the development of skills and information to optimize the LCSs\' interactions with patients. The specialist learns to use nonpharmacological interventions that promote well-being and that can be integrated into the patient\'s Life Care Plana personalized comprehensive pain-management plan created by the patient in collaboration with their LCS. The plan aims to optimize pain management strategies and help the patient learn about the array of nonpharmacological interventions that can be integrated into daily living activities to reduce or eliminate the use of opioid medication. \r\nThe Healing Wheel is the hub of the Life Care Specialist Program. The components of the Healing Wheel are delivered by Life Care Specialists trained to be the bridge between the hospital and home, providing much-needed information about how to taper off opioid medication prescribed after orthopedic surgery. The Healing Wheel includes a Personalized Pain Management Plan, Mental Health Wellness Skills, Relaxation Exercises, Empathic Listening, Care Coordination and Referral, Continued Care after Hospitalization, Caregiver Support, Sleep Coaching, Music Therapy, and Pain Medication Education.\r\nCammie Wolf Rice\'s new book, The Flight: My Opioid Journey, describes her path and the purpose and meaning that came out of her grief over her son\'s avoidable and tragic death. Cammie poignantly describes the events that inspired her to create the CWC and her mission to create prevention strategies to end opioid dependence. The book can be helpful for therapists and clients addressing the opioid crisis personally and systemically.\r\nCammie has a message for families struggling with opioids: ""Your loved one is suffering and don\'t give up on them. Creating a support team around you is crucial, so you have someone to reach out to when you need help."" Cammie encourages all parents to be health advocates for their children: ""We must protect our kids and ask questions if your child must have surgery. Do you have a non-narcotic for my child? How long does my child need to be on this?

"{'We are approaching nearly a year of the pandemic in the United States and to say that I am tired would be an understatement. Sure, staying home all the time and communicating with others outside my household through Zoom hasnt been ideal but at the end of the day, Im healthy and alive, and I thank God for that. There are three groups in this country; there are those of us who are staying home by working remotely and dont want to catch this virus, there are those of us who want to stay home but have to work in-person jobs, and then there are those of us who do not care. What has absolutely exhausted me is not the isolation but the acceptance of mass death that is what has really taken a toll on me.\xa0\r\nOn the day that I publish this piece, 480,663 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19 in the United States. Yesterday, 5,459 people died. The CDC predicts by March 6th, we will have a range of deaths from 515,000 to 540,000 that is anywhere from 35,000 to 60,000 people. Joe Biden has warned Americans to expect a death toll of upwards of 600,000 by the time this is all over; thats at least 100,000 more deaths. This is the size of a\xa0small town filled with friends and family.\xa0We have become numb to these numbers and they have become meaningless. Unfortunately, this mentality is quite familiar to those who work in overdose prevention.\r\nFor years now, overdose deaths (mainly but not only from opioids) have stayed around 70,000 each year. After a small downturn in 2018, there was a 4.6% increase in overdose deaths in 2019 the pandemic is expected to balloon these numbers. One recently released\xa0study\xa0showed that visits to the ER for opioid related overdose in 2020 grew 29% from the year prior. Thousands continue to die and still the government, while pledging action, has barely made a dent in these numbers.\xa0\r\nI have already opined about how I believe the term harm reduction is misused to justify non adherence to public health measures and the lack of a proper government response. Lets be clear: true harm reduction does not view any life as disposable or collateral damage. Harm reduction is not a societal calculus that makes a decision on what number of other peoples deaths is acceptable for the rest of us to resume our lives. The ultimate harm we are trying to reduce in overdose prevention is death. This is why for years advocates have held vigils, have protested for safe injection sites and have called for more to be done. Every overdose death is a tragedy and every COVID death is a tragedy.\r\nCalling for the country to respond to mass death has long felt like an exercise in futility. People (especially those in power) acknowledge that is what is happening is terrible but act like our hands are tied in trying to stop it. Make no mistake, we have the power to dramatically reduce deaths with COVID and overdose we are just unwilling to do what is necessary. For COVID, that looks like a paid shutdown that allows the government to orderly vaccinate people and allows as many people to stay home, while tackling concurrent crises in hunger and housing. For overdose, it looks like allowing safe consumption sites, allowing a safe supply and really expanding access to harm reduction services.\xa0\r\nMass death is a choice, and it is one we can stop making at any time.': ""{{'PERSON': ['Joe Biden'], 'DATE': ['Yesterday', 'March 6th', '2020', '2018', '2019'], 'LOC': ['United States'], 'ORG': ['CDC'], 'PROGRAMS': ['safe injection sites', 'harm reduction services', 'overdose prevention'], 'IMPACT': ['480,663 deaths', '5,459 people died', '35,000 to 60,000 people', '100,000 more deaths', '70,000 each year', '4.6% increase in overdose deaths']}}""}"
"{'Responding to a backlash from pain patients, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released updated guidelines Thursday that offer clinicians more flexibility in the way they prescribe opioids for short- and long-term pain.\r\nThe new recommendations eliminate numerical dose limits and caps on length of treatment for chronic pain patients that had been suggested in the landmark 2016 version of the agency\'s advice, which was aimed at curbing the liberal use of the medication and controlling a rampaging opioid epidemic. Those guidelines cautioned doctors that commencing opioid therapy was a momentous decision for patients.\r\nParts of that nonbinding document were widely misinterpreted, resulting in unintended harm to patients who were benefiting from use of opioids without much risk of addiction. Patients reported they were rapidly tapered off medication by doctors or saw their medication abruptly discontinued, the CDC acknowledged in the new document. Some insurers and pharmacies set rigid limits on duration of prescriptions or dropped patients altogether.\r\nThe new 100 pages of guidance - which remain only recommendations for doctors, nurse practitioners and others authorized to prescribe opioids - emphasize returning the focus to the caregiver and patient deciding on the best course of treatment.\r\n""This guideline is really intended to be a mechanism to help patients and providers work together,"" Christopher Jones, acting director of CDC\'s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, said in an interview Thursday. ""We have leaned in on more principles, rather than thresholds.""\r\nThough a record 107,000 Americans died of opioid overdoses in 2021, much about the epidemic has changed since 2016. The number of prescriptions for opioids, which peaked at more than 255 million in 2012, was still at nearly 215 million when the CDC released the first set of guidelines.\r\nBy 2020, that number had declined to 142 million, a reflection of efforts to reduce opioid use in favor of other approaches to pain and a recognition that many addictions begin with prescribed medication.\r\nThe ongoing overdose epidemic is now caused mainly by illegal fentanyl, which is laced into a wide variety of street drugs and consumed, sometimes unknowingly, by users.\r\nYet chronic pain - defined as pain that lasts more than three months - remains one of the most common conditions suffered by U.S. patients. In 2019, 1 in 5 adults reported chronic pain, and 1 in 14 said it limited life or work activities, according to the CDC. Chronic pain is blamed for $560 billion to $635 billion in direct medical costs, lost productivity and disability each year, and contributes to 9 percent of suicides, the agency said.\r\nThe new recommendations were proposed in February and sent out for comment from the public and experts before being adopted by the CDC. They took into account research on opioids conducted since 2016. Like the previous version, they are not intended for treatment of pain from sickle cell disease and cancer, or palliative and end-of-life care, which demand special consideration from caregivers.\r\nAt least one group had hoped the guidelines would retain numerical caps in one of the boldfaced recommendations for prescribers. In a March 25 letter, Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, one of the fiercest critics of liberal opioid use, advised highlighting a cap of 50 morphine milligram equivalents as the daily line at which prescribers are likely to face ""diminishing returns."" That number is noted deeper in the guidance.\r\nLike the previous guidelines, the new version recommends that caregivers try non-opioid approaches to pain control before initiating the medication. They also note disparity in the care of people of color, some of whom are less likely to be referred to a pain specialist or receive postpartum pain assessments than White people. Black people also receive lower doses of pain medication than their White peers.\r\nThe new recommendations also include advice on ways doctors and patients can discuss tapering off drugs; a warning that clinicians should ""weigh benefits and risks and exercise care when changing opioid dosage""; and a notice that they should ""regularly reevaluate benefits and risks of continued opioid therapy with patients.""\r\nIn no way is there an intent that they be applied as a one-size-fits-all, Jones said.

"{'The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday issued new guidance for doctors who treat pain patients that reverses a 2016 version used to sharply curtail opioid prescriptions, ultimately leading to devastating results for some pain patients.\r\nThe new guidance avoids strict figures on dosage and length of opioid prescriptions, recommends how and when to prescribe opioids, and describes harms and benefits. But the CDC emphasized the recommendations are voluntary and flexible and should not be used to support a one-size-fits-all policy.\r\nThe original version was meant for primary care doctors who treat chronic pain patients but ended up being used by states, licensing boards, insurers, pharmacies and others to force millions of Americans to rapidly reduce or discontinue prescription opioids.\r\nPain patient advocates said the update improves the original version that led to abrupt changes for 8 to 13 million Americans who take opioids to manage pain. But they said prescribers, insurers and others must adopt more nuanced policies to avoid harms such as addiction, suicide and diminishing quality of life.\r\n""The CDC is sending a pretty strong message to all payers, states and health systems that they need to reverse course, that they misapplied the (2016) guideline and they need to change because they\'re causing harm,"" said Kate Nicholson, executive director and founder of the National Pain Advocacy Center.\r\nMORE: Pain patients left in anguish by doctors \'terrified\' of opioid addiction\r\nWhat are the new recommendations?\r\nThe guidance addresses whether to prescribe opioids for pain, determining dosages, length of initial fills, and how and when to follow up with patients.\r\nThe CDC guidance says doctors should:\r\n<ul><li>Discuss alternative therapies and prescribe the lowest dosage for patients who have not taken opioids before.\r\n</li><li>Recommend pain pills for chronic pain patients only if the benefits and ability to do daily tasks outweigh known risks, which can include addiction, overdose and death.\r\n</li><li>Discuss risks and benefits, and consider how opioid prescriptions will be discontinued.\r\n</li><li>Rely on other therapies and try to gradually lower dosages or discontinue opioids for patients already on higher dosages.\r\n</li></ul>Unless there\'s a life-threatening issue such as signs of overdose, doctors should not abruptly discontinue or rapidly reduce opioid dosages, the guidance says.\r\n""Patients with pain should receive compassionate, safe and effective pain care,"" said Christopher Jones, acting director of CDCs National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. ""We want clinicians and patients to have the information they need to weigh the benefits of different approaches to pain care, with the goal of helping people reduce their pain and improve their quality of life.\r\nHow is it different from the old recommendations?\r\nUnder the old recommendation, chronic pain patients complained of being cut off from pills they had taken for months or even years. Some in the middle of cancer treatments, sickle cell disease or recovering from operations could not get pain medications even though the policy did not focus on these individuals.\r\nThe updated guidance has recommendations for those with short-term pain of less than one month, lingering pain of one to three months, and chronic pain of more than three months.\r\nThe original guidance stressed that doctors should be careful to avoid daily opioid doses that exceed 90 morphine milligram equivalents. The new version recommends doctors be cautious but does not forbid prescribing daily doses of more than 50 morphine milligram equivalents. If doctors do prescribe that much, the guidance recommends doctors offer overdose education and the overdose-reversal drug naloxone.\r\nHow will the CDC monitor the guidance?\r\nWhile the guidance is voluntary, the CDC will evaluate and monitor how doctors and patients adjust to the new recommendations.\r\nThe CDC plans to educate doctors and others if the agency sees evidence people are misinterpreting the guidance or using it as ""justification for taking some rigid action that applies to all patients,"" Jones said in a call with reporters.\r\n\'Wake-up call\': Allergy medications may play a deadly role in the opioid epidemic\r\nWhat are the lingering effects from the original guidance?\r\nStudies show more than half of primary care doctors won\'t see a patient who takes opioids to manage pain, Nicholson said.\r\nAbruptly tapering or discontinuing opioids increases pain patients\' risk of addiction and suicide. Jones said abrupt tapering ""creates a very real risk"" for patients, including mental health, thoughts of suicide or seeking illicit opioids to stave off withdrawal.\r\nAfter the 2016 guidance, more than half of states passed laws that limited initial opioid prescriptions for acute pain to seven days or less. Many states limited pain pill fills for Medicaid enrollees, and private insurers and pharmacies also curtailed opioid prescriptions. Some states enacted strict limits on doses, prompting doctors to aggressively taper patients who had been on opioids for years, and medical boards sanctioned doctors who ran afoul of the tighter requirements.\r\nAfter the original guidelines, a non-peer-reviewed survey of more than 3,000 patients found 84% reported more pain and worse quality of life, and 42% said they had considered suicide, according to the CDC.\r\nMORE: States detail $26B settlement to resolve opioid lawsuits with Johnson &amp; Johnson, drug distributors\r\nDo disparities exist among pain patients?\r\nBlack patients have lower overdose rates from prescription pain pills than white patients, Latinos and Native Americans, but one study cited by the CDC showed Black patients were more likely than whites to have early refills restricted.

"{'By John C Messinger, Anand Chukka, and J. Wesley Boyd\r\nIsolation and anxiety caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have fueled an already out-of-control overdose crisis. In 2020 alone, more than 100,000 individuals died from an overdose. With overdose rates reaching such unfathomable heights, dramatic steps are needed to stem the loss of life.\r\nThe Department of Health and Human Services took one important step by eliminating a special training requirementobtaining a so-called ""X waiver""for clinicians to be able to prescribe buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist used to treat opioid use disorder. This drug helps people avoid opioids by reducing opioid cravings and withdrawal symptoms.\r\nWhile the waiver elimination aims to expand access to this lifesaving medication, some critics say that deregulation would lead to increased ""diversion"" of buprenorphine, meaning its use for some purpose other than its intended use, or by someone other than the person it was prescribed for.\r\nAlthough it is difficult to get high on buprenorphine, some people do use it as a recreational drug. Rates of overdose, however, are low; for example, buprenorphine accounted for less than 5 percent of overdose deaths in Tennessee in 2020.\r\nPeople who use buprenorphine prescribed for someone else generally use it to help treat their opioid use disorder. One study from Massachusetts found that greater than 90 percent of individuals who had used diverted buprenorphine did so to prevent opioid craving or withdrawal, while less than 10 percent used it to get high.\r\nAlthough medication diversion of any sort is generally considered harmful, as we argue in a commentary published on March 22 in the Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine, the potential of diverted buprenorphine to save lives outweighs any hypothetical harms of its use.\r\nThe effects of buprenorphine are stunning. One meta-analysis found that people taking buprenorphine are 64 percent less likely to die from overdose than those not taking medications for opioid use disorder. For reference, statins, regarded as one of the most beneficial and universally supported medications used in the treatment of heart disease, reduce the risk of major coronary events by roughly 30 percent.\r\nThough we recognize the potential dangers of buying and selling drugs ""on the street,"" we must point out that the lifesaving effect of buprenorphine remains even when it is being diverted. A recent study found that the use of nonprescribed buprenorphine, even when used less than once a week, reduced the risk of unintentional overdose. Buprenorphine in and of itself, even when separated from structured medical care, is a powerful tool to reduce the risk of overdose.\r\nAnother benefit of diverted buprenorphine is that it offers a stepping stone for people who are not being treated for addiction to seek medical care. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that only 10 percent of individuals who need substance use treatment received care from an addiction specialist. While some of the deficit is due to a lack of available clinicians or treatment centers, there are many people who intentionally avoid seeking medical care due to a long history of mistreatment, stigma, and marginalization of people who use drugs.\r\nAnecdotally, a large proportion of those seeking medications for treating opioid use disorder has tried buprenorphine theyve been given by a friend or bought on the street. For those who have reasons to distrust the medical system, diverted buprenorphine from a close contact offers an important gateway into medically supervised treatment. Indeed, studies have demonstrated an association between the use of nonprescribed buprenorphine and that individuals willingness to participate in treatment with a medical provider.\r\nOver the last few years, opioids sold on the street have become dramatically more potent. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 70 percent of overdose deaths since the COVID-19 pandemic started have been caused by synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. Fentanyl has dominated the opiate market and is now found in many other recreational drugs sold on the street, potentially contributing to the increasing rates of overdose nationwide.\r\nWhile buprenorphine carries its own risk of overdose, it is minuscule compared to that posed by fentanyl. A recent study of 534 opioid-involved deaths found that only one death was solely attributable to buprenorphine. The presence of diverted buprenorphine as an alternative to fentanyl offers a safer option for people who use drugs.\r\nThe availability of buprenorphine is particularly important as medications for opioid use disorder prescribed by a medical provider can be difficult to access. In one study done in New York, people who use heroin, a historically marginalized and underinsured group, have high levels of interest in using buprenorphine but low levels of access to it. And these difficulties in accessing buprenorphine disproportionately affect racially minoritized populations. While buprenorphine access increased between 2004 and 2013 for all New York City zip codes, this increase was greatest in primarily wealthy, white neighborhoods.\r\nThe availability of diverted buprenorphine may help increase access to communities that have historically been excluded from medically-directed buprenorphine. However, it is important to acknowledge that this is not a legitimate long-term solution and that additional work must be done to bridge the gap in care for these populations.\r\nThe overdose crisis shows no signs of abating; the last twelve months have been the deadliest in history, with over 100,000 overdose deaths for the first time. In times of crisis, we need to prioritize saving lives over and above our personal comfort zones or individual morals and values otherwise. With respect to overdose deaths, this means that buprenorphine should be available to everyone who needs it, whether that\'s via prescriptions or otherwise. Making that happen, we argue, requires easing concerns about the diversion of buprenorphine and decriminalizing its sale.\r\nThis is more than just a pipe dream: In June of 2021, Vermont and Rhode Island became the first two U.S. states to decriminalize possession of nonprescribed buprenorphine.\r\nBuprenorphine saves lives. It\'s time to promote its use for those with opioid use disorders.\r\nJohn C Messinger is a third-year student at Harvard Medical School in Boston.

"{'US life expectancy increased this past year, from 76.4 to 77.5 years, according to a report published Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, after declining for two years in a row. \r\nIts not exactly a cause for celebration. Americas life expectancy has been lower than that of other wealthy countries for decades, and declined more than other nations during the pandemic. The trends were bad before the pandemic, and awful during it. Now theyre on their way back to being merely bad.\r\nAs a measure of a nations well-being, life expectancy is useful, but its meaning is sometimes misunderstood. Life expectancy isnt about individual people its about the moments theyre born into. The metric doesnt refer to the number of years a baby born today can expect to live. Instead, it reflects how long a baby born today would live if nothing in their environment changed over their lifetime. Its like saying: If every year of this childs life was like the year 2023, how long would they live? \r\nThat means that if a baby is born during a period when lots of people are dying at relatively young ages e.g., during a pandemic or a war their estimated life expectancy would be lower than if they were born during happier times. And obviously, the babys individual life expectancy will change if their environment and conditions change if the pandemic or war ends, for example. \r\nThe point is that life expectancy changes in response to the social, cultural, environmental, and political environments countries create. That makes it a helpful tool for tracking the health of nations populations over time, and for comparing the health of different countries populations.\r\nA closer look at this years figures offers some pointed reminders that the USs life expectancy curve isnt an accident, but a response to choices its elected officials have made.\r\nHere are four takeaways from the report.\r\n1) Covid-19 killed fewer people in 2022 than it did in 2021 but it still killed a lot of people. \r\nThe historic drop in life expectancy that occurred in the first two years of the pandemic was the worst the US had seen since World War II. The CDC estimates 375,000 Americans died due to Covid-19 infection in 2020, and about 460,000 in 2021 an almost incomprehensible loss of human potential. \r\nIn 2022, there were fewer Covid-19 deaths, but still a lot: 244,000. \r\nThis is the main reason for the increase of life expectancy in the CDC report: Covid-19 is killing fewer people.\r\nBut Covid-19 may also help explain why the US is not yet all the way back up to its pre-pandemic life expectancy of 78.8 years.\r\nMost other countries around the world also saw big dips in their life expectancies during the first year of the pandemic. But the USs decrease was bigger than other countries and its rebound has been slower. \r\nThe authors of a study assessing pandemic-era life expectancy changes across a range of countries hypothesized that US mortality due to Covid-19 was higher than that in European countries due to higher rates of underlying conditions like obesity and diabetes. A recent analysis by the Washington Post suggests that stalled progress on preventing and treating chronic illness is responsible for the majority of deaths among Americans in their prime.\r\nWere starting from a lower spot, and we sunk faster than other countries, said Joshua Sharfstein, a physician and epidemiologist who directs the Bloomberg American Health Initiative at Johns Hopkins Universitys public health school. And now were trying to crawl our way out.\r\n2) Racial/ethnic groups that lost the most when Covid was at its most lethal had the most to gain as the virus got weaker. \r\nThe figures in the report suggest certain racial and ethnic groups made particularly big gains in life expectancy. For example, life expectancy went up by 2.3 years for American Indians and Alaska Natives; by 2.2 years for Hispanic Americans; and by 1.6 years for Black Americans. \r\nDoes this mean the US has fixed health disparities?\r\nNo. This reflects that those groups that had the highest rates of pandemic-related deaths had the most to gain when Covid-related mortality went down. Groups had a little bump that was in proportion to the loss that they had, said Sharfstein.\r\nOver the course of the pandemic, American Indians and Alaska Natives died of Covid-19 at more than twice the rate of white Americans, and Black and Hispanic Americans also died at much higher rates. \r\nThe disproportionate increase in life expectancy in these groups just indicates they were further from their baseline during the worst of the pandemic.\r\n3) Infant mortality rose. Its likely due to abortion bans and failing maternal health care. \r\nAnother factor holding down US life expectancy, according to the report, is infant mortality. \r\nIn 2022, rising death rates due to perinatal conditions (that is, fetal deaths later in pregnancy or newborn deaths ) and congenital malformations kept the topline numbers from creeping higher. \r\nThat hadnt been the case in 2021, or in 2020. In fact, in those years, death rates due to these types of conditions actually decreased.\r\nThis is likely a consequence of ending the constitutional right to abortion, said Sharfstein. Theres a very strong relationship between access to abortion and infant mortality and infant mortality went up, he said. (Multiplestudies have linked restrictions to abortion access with higher infant death rates. According to the Society for Family Planning, there were about 32,000 fewer abortions in the six months after the Supreme Court overturned a national right to the procedure in June 2022.)\r\nSome of this is related to changes in how doomed pregnancies are managed in the face of criminalized abortion. When OB-GYNs cannot safely provide a full spectrum of medical care, they cannot provide the abortions that would prevent pregnant people from carrying nonviable pregnancies to term. That means pregnancies that previously would have ended long before labor and delivery are instead progressing to birth and the infants who result from those pregnancies are dying shortly thereafter. \r\nBut its also likely related to the impact of abortion restrictions on the availability of prenatal care and that directly affects both infant and maternal mortality. As I wrote earlier this month, maternal care providers are leaving states with abortion restrictions, and medical trainees are avoiding these states because they know that in states that dont permit abortion, they wont get training in a key part of pregnancy care. \r\nPrenatal care reduces the risk of infant death and may also reduce risks to mothers and a lack of prenatal care increases the risk babies will die. \r\nTheres no question that the reduction in reproductive health care access has implications for population health, said Sharfstein.\r\n4) Our baseline compared to other countries both before and after peak pandemic is low, and we havent taken any steps to address the root causes.\r\nIn 1980, US life expectancy was among the highest in the developed world now, its one of the lowest. There are many possible reasons for this: Compared with other countries, the USs health care system is one of the most difficult to afford and navigate, and invests less in preventive care than in high-tech treatment.

"{'Xiao Hua Yang for Vox\r\n\n \n\n\n Opioid addiction doesn’t get as many headlines as it used to, but the crisis is as bad as ever. It doesn’t have to be. The opioid crisis doesn’t get as many headlines as it used to before Covid-19, but the news remains stubbornly, shockingly bad. \nDecades into the deadliest drug overdose epidemic in American history, people are dying at higher rates than ever. Between 2017 and 2021, the number of overdose deaths involving opioids jumped from 47,600 to 80,411 — many more Americans than are killed each year by guns or cars. The surge has been largely driven by powerful synthetics like fentanyl, an opioid 50 times more potent than heroin. \nProvisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show nearly as many opioid-involved overdose deaths in 2022, at 79,770. Overdoses in Black, American Indian, and Latinx communities have been rising even faster, widening the mortality gap between white people and people of color. In 2020, Black men 65 and older died of overdoses at seven times the rate of white men in the same age range. \nMeanwhile, the number of Americans struggling with opioid addiction remains staggering. In 2022, 6.1 million people 12 and older had an opioid use disorder, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s most recent annual survey, while 8.9 million reported misusing opioids within the past year. \nLooking at these statistics, I thought back to something that addiction specialist Sarah Wakeman told me when I was reporting on the opioid crisis five years ago. “Most people get better,” Wakeman, who is the senior medical director for substance use disorder at Mass General Brigham, said then. “That’s what we don’t ever talk about in the opioids conversation.” \nWhen she says “most people,” she means most people who get long-term medication-assisted treatment (MAT), widely considered the gold standard in addiction care. It combines regular counseling and behavioral therapy with the medication methadone or buprenorphine (often prescribed under the brand name Suboxone). Both contain synthetic opioid compounds, which prevent withdrawal and cravings, and they can lower overdoses by as much as 76 percent. (A third medication, less often used, is naltrexone, which blocks the high from opioids.) \nThe philosophy of MAT — a departure from the moralizing, abstinence-based rehab and 12-step programs that dominated addiction care for most of the 20th century — began to take shape in the early 2000s, when the Food and Drug Administration approved buprenorphine and a federal law authorized primary care physicians to prescribe it. \nMAT shifted the treatment paradigm dramatically. Now, every overdose death is a tragedy, Wakeman told me, not because opioid addiction is unsolvable but because, like so many other chronic illnesses, it’s now very treatable. \nSo why have we failed to stop or even significantly slow the opioid crisis? Why do nearly 90 percent of those with opioid use disorder still lack access to evidence-based treatment like MAT? \nThis fall, I got back in touch with Wakeman and posed this question. Is the problem us, I asked her, or is it the opioids? “Oh, it’s definitely us,” she said. The addiction crisis is as much an “ideological challenge” as it is a medical one. \n“We, as a society, have spent more than 100 years thinking of and building policies and systems and punishments to address addiction as if it were an issue of morality,” Wakeman said. “And so even though now we’re starting to talk about it as a public health issue, our policies, our clinical approaches, our care models, our funding, really reflect this idea that we actually think people are doing something bad and so we should make it really hard on them.”\nThis punitive mindset contributes to a disproportionate emphasis on detox, “which happens to be the most lucrative, least effective element of recovery,” as Walter Ling, a UCLA psychiatrist and neurologist whose research helped pave the way for FDA approval of buprenorphine and other opioid addiction medications, put it in a recent op-ed. Even now, many drug rehab centers stress detoxification, meaning going off opioids rapidly, over MAT. A 2020 nationwide survey of inpatient programs found that only 29 percent offered a long-term MAT option; only one in eight residential treatment facilities for adolescents offered buprenorphine for long-term treatment, according to a study last June. \nNearly every clinician I spoke to offered some version of this same observation about how culture and ideology restrict addiction care. “The main thing that’s holding us back is stigma,” said Brown University epidemiologist Josiah Rich, an adviser to the Rhode Island task force on overdoses, who has spent decades providing HIV and addiction care to people locked up in the state’s prisons. \nPhysician and anthropologist Kimberly Sue, a professor at Yale and the author of Getting Wrecked: Women, Incarceration, and the American Opioid Crisis, told me about treating young people jailed at Rikers Island whose families had cut them off or kicked them out for using drugs. “The US is extremely culturally punitive,” she said. “You know, ‘Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps.’ ‘You made your bed, you lie in it.’ … We’re told that you’re a loser, you don’t deserve to live because you use drugs. You don’t deserve to be healthy.” \nOur approach to treatment hasn’t caught up with the science of what works best. “Until the medications came around, our treatment for opioid addiction was mostly a failure,” Ling told me. “Yet we put our philosophy, our idea, ahead of science, ahead of what we know.” That trickles down into how people interact with the health care system — and how structural barriers like racism and poverty compound the damage for those most susceptible to addiction. \nThe war on drugs laid the foundation for dysfunctional addiction treatment\nThe face of opioid addiction in America changed dramatically over the past two decades. As overdoses soared in white and rural communities and the crisis was no longer concentrated in cities or communities of color, public discourse around addiction shifted. Experts and policymakers began talking urgently about “deaths of despair” among working-class white people, and a surge of sympathetic media attention sought to understand the problem through this new wave of victims. Americans increasingly began to see addiction the same way medical authorities had for decades — as an illness. \nEven so, our treatment paradigm has not caught up. Perhaps the clearest example of how Americans’ cultural mindset limits access to treatment is the onerous regulation of methadone. Patients can receive the medication only at federally certified clinics, which tend to be located in impoverished or high-crime neighborhoods. Most patients must appear at the clinic daily for months or years before they’re allowed to take home even a small number of doses. This means waiting in line, often for hours, missing appointments and work, having to arrange for child care. For some patients, it also means long commutes, sometimes across state lines. \nIn stark contrast, buprenorphine can be prescribed in doctors’ offices and dispensed by pharmacies. Although the overdose risk with methadone is slightly higher than for buprenorphine, it is stigma, not science, that guides methadone regulations. The medication was initially introduced in the US in 1947 as a pain reliever and cough suppressant; researchers established its effectiveness at treating opioid addiction during the 1960s, amid a spike in heroin use that devastated Black urban communities. Back then, even more than now, Americans viewed addiction through the lens of criminality and deviance rather than disease, so federal regulations put in place in the early 1970s, just as Richard Nixon declared the “war on drugs,” walled off methadone from mainstream medical settings. That’s where it remains today, even though in countries like Canada, the UK, and Australia, where primary care doctors have been prescribing methadone for decades, it’s treated more like a normal medication.\nThe long lines outside methadone clinics is one of the main reasons people drop out of or never begin treatment with the medication. Because of these restrictions, methadone is “legendarily hated” among drug users, New York University sociologist David Frank, who is in recovery himself and has been taking methadone for 20 years, told me. \nIn a recent study he published, one participant compared methadone treatment to “liquid handcuffs,” while another described the degrading experience of being told to keep waiting in line after her water broke. “Treatment is not set up to meet the actual needs of the population,” Frank said. “In fact, it’s a barrier to meeting those needs.” Most people come to treatment not because of a commitment to abstinence or even to cure a disease, but “to deal with the fact that the drug they’re dependent on is highly criminalized,” he said. “In my research, this comes up time and again. I ask people, why did you get on methadone? And they always tell the same story as mine: ‘I’m dope sick every day, it’s impossible. I get arrested, I’m scared, my life is falling apart.’ It’s a very pragmatic response. Methadone helps reduce those problems.” \nThe punitive regulations flow largely from methadone’s history, providers say, from a time when heroin use was closely associated with Black Americans. When buprenorphine received FDA approval 40 years later, the opioid crisis was hitting white America, too. “People’s perceptions about methadone are really frozen in history,” said Paul Joudrey, a Pittsburgh-based addiction care doctor who, along with Frank, is on the board of the National Coalition to Liberate Methadone. \nBuprenorphine prescribers are far more common in segregated white communities, while methadone clinics are more prevalent in Black and Hispanic neighborhoods. Patients who are white, wealthy, and well-educated are more likely than Black or Hispanic patients to receive buprenorphine. Patients of color are often directed instead to methadone clinics — and even when they do receive buprenorphine, the average course of treatment is shorter. \nOur very ideas of what it means to recover are still bound up with the stigmatized, criminalized history of addiction. A common misconception among the public, experts told me, and even some care providers and people who use drugs themselves, is that recovery with buprenorphine or methadone isn’t “real” recovery; that it just replaces one addiction with another. \n“We think of addiction, which is a lifetime-long problem, as being like pneumonia or some other kind of infection,” Ling said. “You come off [the drugs], and then people say, ‘Why can’t they just go back to their old self?’ But they can’t. Substance use has irreversible effects on the body and the brain.” Some people need to stay on MAT for years or decades — and that’s okay, Ling says. \nSome experts push this argument further, challenging the notion that being in recovery necessarily means getting off drugs altogether. “My goals for my patients are that they are alive, healthy, and able to have a connected, meaningful life,” said Sue of Yale, who is the former medical director of the National Harm Reduction Coalition. “I do not care how much or what they use in order to achieve that.” For some people, that means strict sobriety; for others, it might mean using drugs less often, or using certain drugs but not others. Sue never mandates abstinence. “The first thing I always ask my patients is, ‘What are your goals, in regards to your substance use?’” Sue told me. “Most people have never been asked that question.”\nProviders on the cutting edge of addiction treatment are increasingly moving toward this approach, with greater emphasis on harm reduction, an evidence-based, albeit controversial, strategy that aims to minimize the damaging effects of drug use rather than fixating on forcing patients to get “clean.” In a society raised on the concept of total abstinence from drugs, that can be a tough sell politically — but the idea is that opioid addiction is a serious illness, and breaking an addiction to opioids is extremely hard (as Ling said, patients can’t simply go back to their old selves). Harm reduction is in part about finding an approach that will actually work for people: reaching those who might not otherwise seek care, empowering them to make their own choices, and helping them work toward incremental changes. \nHarm reduction measures include safe consumption sites (where people use drugs under the supervision of trained medical professionals), syringe exchange programs (where users can obtain clean needles), distribution programs for naloxone (a medication that can reverse an overdose), and fentanyl test strips (which can prevent overdoses by detecting whether someone’s drugs contain fentanyl). “Any positive change — that’s sort of the mantra of harm reduction,” said Sue. \nCutting-edge treatments don’t mean much if patients can’t access them\nA visit last fall with one of Sarah Wakeman’s patients during a checkup in her Boston clinic gave me a glimpse of addiction treatment — and the barriers that work against it. Samuel (who’s being referred to by a pseudonym to protect his privacy) first encountered opioids in high school, when his doctor prescribed them (“pretty heavily,” he said) for a wrestling injury. “I found out that I liked it,” he said, and he became addicted in college, after experimenting with drugs with a roommate. Before long, he wound up on heroin. For several years, his life unraveled: debt, lost jobs, defaulted loans, an arrest, multiple trips to rehab and 12-step programs. \nSamuel found his way to Wakeman’s practice a few years ago. He’s stable now, taking buprenorphine — with a job and an apartment and a new puppy. But he told me he’d encountered judgment and distrust from many of the people he initially looked to for help, even those whose job it is to help him, like doctors and psychiatrists. Even now, pharmacists sometimes hesitate to refill his buprenorphine prescription, leading him to stash extra doses so he doesn’t run out, he said, which can be “dangerous behavior” for someone with an addiction. \nThat stigma compounds the hurdles that are already a part of buprenorphine treatment. Although it’s intended to be a long-term therapy, as a controlled substance, it is prescribed in small increments that must be refilled every few days or weeks. If he’d been any less motivated to get better, he told me, he’s not sure he would have made it — or, he added, if he’d been any less privileged: Samuel is an educated white man in his mid-30s who grew up in a family of medical professionals. \nThe logistical and ideological obstacles to treatment are, of course, tied to the kinds of people who bear the brunt of the epidemic — those who exist, in one way or another, on the margins of society. Addiction is one of a cluster of interconnected crises unfolding across the country: homelessness, poverty, mental illness, untreated trauma, an epidemic of loneliness. Opioid overdoses spiked in 2020 during the onslaught of Covid-19, in part because people were isolated from each other as well as from treatment. Racism plays a major role in limiting access to treatment, too, as does mass incarceration. There’s a shortage of addiction care providers, particularly in rural America, where the scarcity of basic primary care for all types of patients is increasingly dire. \nUntil recently, nearly 60 percent of rural people lived in counties without a single doctor authorized to prescribe buprenorphine. (That changed last year, after a law requiring providers to obtain a special waiver to dispense the medication was eliminated.) In Madison, Wisconsin, where Elizabeth Salisbury-Afshar practices addiction medicine, it’s not unusual for patients to travel one or two hours each way to her clinic “for an appointment that’s maybe 30 minutes long,” she says. “It’s a full-day endeavor. But folks don’t have another choice.” \nIn rural areas, Salisbury-Ashfar said, many of the primary care doctors who would be the first line of addiction treatment are too overwhelmed to provide it. “The providers that we have, we’re just trying not to burn them out, because we are short-staffed on every front,” she said. “We would love to have enough primary care docs to be doing this, but primary care docs can’t keep up with primary care.” \nIt’s not enough to have a breakthrough treatment like MAT if the people who need it can’t get it — or can’t stay in it. Among the “compounding mistakes and failures” that led to the current crisis is the fact that “our health care system is not set up well to accommodate people who are vulnerable or marginalized,” a group that includes most of those with addiction, said Joudrey, the Pittsburgh addiction doctor. “In the United States, we’ve become so focused on innovation and looking for technological solutions, we can end up neglecting the sociological and economic contributors of the overdose epidemic.”\nJoudrey told me about a patient he met years ago in a mobile treatment program. He started her on buprenorphine, which helped her stop using fentanyl, and every year afterward, she would send a thank-you email. “She was just thrilled,” he recalled. But she was also socially isolated and stuck in a dead-end job that didn’t quite pay the bills. This precarity left her at greater risk of falling back into drugs. “The medicine didn’t change her larger social circumstances,” Joudrey said. “As a clinician, as a researcher, it’s sort of grappling with what we can and can’t do, in terms of the limits of health care and medicine.” \nWe have low-effort interventions that can make a difference\nThese experiences hammer home the urgent need to build a different treatment architecture to lower overdose deaths. Research has outlined a number of promising approaches. Some have begun gaining traction already, including harm reduction. Although contentious for many years because many believed it enabled drug use, harm reduction has been gaining mainstream acceptance among providers and policymakers. Decades of research, in the US as well as in countries like Canada and Ukraine, show that it saves both lives and money. \nDespite halting and uneven progress, a nationwide push to bring MAT into jails and prisons — driven in part by ACLU lawsuits in several states — is picking up momentum. The need for this is urgent: Overdose deaths from drugs or alcohol rose by 600 percent in state prisons between 2001 and 2018, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics — which estimated in 2009 (the most recent year with national data) that almost two-thirds of incarcerated people have substance use disorders. A 2015 study in North Carolina found that the risk of overdose was as much as 40 times higher for those recently released from prison than for other state residents.\nIn 2014, Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where Wakeman practices, opened one of the first “bridge clinics” in the country, intended to bridge the gap between a patient’s discharge from the emergency room (after, say, an overdose) and longer-term addiction treatment — a critical moment, Wakeman told me, when the risk of relapse or overdose is high. Patients can walk into the bridge clinic without an appointment — from the emergency department down the hall, or simply right off the street — and begin buprenorphine treatment that day. They can also receive psychiatric counseling services, recovery coaching, and nursing care, and the clinic keeps harm reduction supplies for patients still using. If they want to, Wakeman said, people can just have a cup of coffee and “hang out here if they need a place to be okay.” \nBridge clinics have been opening up at other sites, too, including dozens in California alone, and early evidence shows they’ve led to promising rates of MAT treatment and linked patients to longer-term addiction care. Those effects can ripple through other parts of the hospital. One study by researchers in Syracuse, New York, found that emergency department visits dropped by 42 percent in the six months after a bridge clinic opened. Research also indicates that bridge clinics help fill a void in care for patients with “clinically complex” cases: patients with concurrent addictions to other substances, serious mental illness, homelessness, and infections like HIV or hepatitis. \nWhere primary care doctors are stretched thin, nurses could fill gaps in access to care. Since 2016, federal regulations have allowed nurse practitioners and physician assistants (PAs) to prescribe buprenorphine, but laws in some states, including those hit hard by the overdose crisis, still block them from providing that care. Tennessee explicitly forbids nurses and PAs from prescribing buprenorphine. “So you can’t do everything you’re educated and certified to do,” said Matthew Tierney, a psychiatric nurse practitioner and clinical professor at the University of California San Francisco, who serves as medical director for inpatient substance use management for UCSF Health. Advanced practice nurses, he said, especially those in mental health, “have the education and training to really treat substance related disorders.” When federal rules opened up prescribing to nurses and PAs, they began applying for licenses in higher numbers than physicians. \nBringing methadone care into normal medical settings, like in other countries, would be a huge step in opening up access. Early in the Covid pandemic, many methadone clinics relaxed their rules, allowing more take-home doses and letting family members pick up medications for patients in quarantine — offering a glimpse of what lasting change might look like. \nA bill before Congress, the Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access Act (MOTA), would effectively make that permanent, authorizing addiction medicine physicians and psychiatrists to prescribe methadone. Studies indicate that patients are no more likely to overdose or abuse the medication when they’re able to take home a longer supply. In fact, it seems to help survival rates. \nAmong addiction specialists, opinions about MOTA are, admittedly, not uniform — some worry the bill goes too far and would put patients at risk of methadone overdose, while others think it doesn’t go far enough in expanding access. Rachel Simon, a doctor who practices at the methadone clinic in New York’s Bellevue Hospital, sees MOTA as “a crucial first step” to lowering treatment barriers. “Methadone is a beautiful medicine,” she told me. “The time to make changes was yesterday.” \nWhat if we remove treatment from sterile medical settings?\nFor some patients, it might help to disentangle addiction care from formal medical settings. Context matters, and making treatment more culturally authentic can succeed where other approaches fail. The Connecticut-based Imani Breakthrough Project, launched in 2017, brings addiction care into Black and Latinx churches as a way to address racial disparities in treatment. Developed by Yale addiction psychiatrists Ayana Jordan and Chyrell Bellamy, the program (“Imani” means “faith” in Swahili) consists of weekly mutual support and recovery education classes alongside individualized coaching and cognitive behavioral therapy, all held in churches. \n“This project was really born out of a dire need,” Jordan told me — at a time when Black and Hispanic overdose deaths were climbing, but the media was primarily focused on the epidemic’s white, rural victims. \nWhile they were developing the program, Jordan said, “overwhelmingly, what we found is that people didn’t want to come into traditional care. They didn’t feel safe.” (Black Americans in particular often distrust the medical establishment — with good historical reason.) And for many patients, spirituality was important to recovery, Jordan told me, so the church itself represented a form of intervention: a sacred and familiar space where people in the community felt known. \nOriginally located in eight churches across Connecticut, the program recently expanded into Rhode Island and New Orleans, with plans to open in Boston and New York City. In 2021, Jordan and her team launched a new version of the Imani program as a five-year NIH-funded project, in which participants can consult with Black or Latinx psychiatrists via telehealth to start MAT in their church. The eventual goal, she told me, is to implement the Imani model nationwide. \nAccording to a study of Imani’s first three years, a striking 42 percent of participants remained in the program after 12 weeks. (There isn’t a perfect comparison to treatment in a standard medical setting, but a 2016 analysis of addiction treatment data found that 20 percent of Black patients and 15 percent of Latinx patients completed their programs, compared to 60 percent of white patients.) Participants also improved their scores on tests measuring wellness and community citizenship. “And we had great outcomes in terms of stopping substance use altogether, or decreasing their substance use,” Jordan told me. \nRecalling the early sessions, Jordan said, “We were seeing for the first time an environment that is really clear about the sovereignty of being Black or Latinx.” In a country where the dual identity of being a person of color with addiction means that “you’re totally thrown away,” she said, having a place where “church members alongside people who look like you, welcome you, and also integrate medical practices into the group is extremely powerful.”': ""{'PERSON': ['Xiao Hua Yang', 'Sarah Wakeman', 'Walter Ling', 'Josiah Rich', 'Kimberly Sue', 'Paul Joudrey', 'David Frank', 'Elizabeth Salisbury-Afshar', 'Matthew Tierney', 'Rachel Simon', 'Ayana Jordan', 'Chyrell Bellamy'], 'DATE': ['Between 2017 and 2021', 'In 2020', 'In 2022', 'five years ago', 'in the early 2000s', 'last June', 'in 1947', 'in the 1960s', 'in the early 1970s', 'In 2014', 'in 2001 and 2018', 'in 2009', 'in 2015', 'Since 2016', 'in 2017', 'In 2021', 'Over the past two decades', 'during the 1960s'], 'LOC': ['American', 'Black', 'American Indian', 'Latinx', 'Mass General Brigham', 'UCLA', 'NY', 'Madison', 'Wisconsin', 'Pittsburgh', 'Tennessee', 'New York', 'Syracuse', 'Boston', 'California', 'Connecticut', 'Rhode Island', 'New Orleans', 'New York City'], 'ORG': ['Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Mass General Hospital', 'Food and Drug Administration', 'ACLU', 'Bureau of Justice Statistics', 'National Coalition to Liberate Methadone', 'US', 'University of California San Francisco', 'UCSF Health', 'Congress', 'Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access Act (MOTA)', 'Bellevue Hospital', 'Imani Breakthrough Project', 'Yale', 'NIH'], 'PROGRAMS': ['opioid use disorder', 'medication-assisted treatment (MAT)', 'MAT', 'addiction specialist', 'evidence-based treatment like MAT', 'ideological challenge', 'health care system', 'addiction care', 'methadone clinics', 'Modernizing Opioid Treatment Access Act (MOTA)', 'Imani Breakthrough Project'], 'IMPACT': ['dying at higher rates than ever', 'jumped from 47,600 to 80,411', 'surge has been largely driven by powerful synthetics like fentanyl', 'rising even faster', 'opioid addiction remains staggering', '6.1 million people 12 and older had an opioid use disorder', '8.9 million reported misusing opioids within the past year', 'unsolvable', 'a beautiful medicine', 'halting and uneven progress', 'risk of relapse or overdose is high', 'overdose deaths from drugs or alcohol rose by 600 percent in state prisons between 2001 and 2018', 'from a medical standpoint', 'whole life approach']}""}"
"{'Addiction medicine encompasses the prevention, evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of persons suffering from the disease of addiction and providing help to family members who are affected by a loved ones substance use or addiction. \r\nIn October 2015, the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) officially recognized addiction medicine as a subspecialty. And while its nice to have another certificate to put on your wall or an additional line on your curriculum vitae, the treatment of those suffering from the consequences of substance use disorder (SUD) is not and cannot be restricted to just specialists.\r\nAddiction is a disease that now impacts more than 40 million Americans. Thats approximately 14.5 percent of the adult population. Meanwhile, overdose rates have continued to trend high, especially with the prevalence of the synthetic opioid fentanyl. There is no medical specialty that does not encounter patients and family members affected by addiction. We all have the opportunity to assess, intervene, and provide treatment for those afflicted with this disease.\r\nSBIRT is a comprehensive, integrated, evidence-based approach for delivering early intervention and treatment services for individuals with substance use issues or those at risk for SUDs. Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) is something we all should do with every patient we meet regardless of our specialty or what it says on the certificates on our walls.\r\nWe wouldnt think of treating a patient without asking about allergies or other medications. Why would we not ask them about other substances they take? Not only does utilizing SBIRT help identify your clients at risk for addiction, but it also helps decrease the stigma and shame surrounding addiction issues. It lets them know that your office is a safe place to talk about substance use and that you will get them to help if they need it.\r\nBut beyond training new (and old) doctors to screen for SUDs, we need to look for opportunities to expand the education and training on addiction in our medical schools and residency programs. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, only about 3,100 medical professionals are trained in addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry. Additionally, researchers from Substance Abuse discovered that only 24 percent of residency programs nationwide dedicate 12 or more hours of their curricula to addiction medicine.\r\nIn April 2021, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) took steps to lower some barriers for doctors (and nurse practitioners and physician assistants) to prescribing buprenorphine. Buprenorphine, a partial opiate agonist, has been shown to reduce mortality and illicit opioid use in patients with opioid use disorder. Before this, only about 6 percent of active physicians in the U.S. held the Drug Enforcement Administrations (DEAs) X-waiver, permitting them to prescribe buprenorphine. Why not provide this education and training to every new doctor before they graduate from medical school?\r\nRecent data from the CDCs National Center for Health Statistics indicates an estimated 100,306 overdose deaths in the U.S. during the 12 months ending in April 2021, a 28.5 percent increase from the previous year. Deaths from opioids increased nearly 35 percent to almost 76,000 Americans during the same period. \r\nThe addiction and overdose epidemic does look bleak when we look at it in totality. But suppose enough new doctors are aware of the rewards of treating patients with SUDs and granted greater opportunities to sit with these human beings who suffer from addiction. In that case, we can save and transform even more lives, patient by patient.\r\nIn my training (admittedly 35 years ago), I was provided with a mere one-hour lecture on addiction. I now consider myself fortunate to interact daily with people who struggle with addiction and seek recovery from substance use disorders.\r\nWe, as doctors, should all be so fortunate to help make a difference in the lives of this resilient group of patients.

We all can be!': ""{'PERSON': ['None'], 'DATE': ['October 2015', 'April 2021'], 'LOC': ['U.S.'], 'ORG': ['American Board of Medical Specialties', 'Department of Health and Human Services', 'Association of American Medical Colleges', 'CDCs National Center for Health Statistics', 'Drug Enforcement Administrations'], 'PROGRAMS': ['resource hub'], 'IMPACT': ['lower some barriers for doctors to prescribing buprenorphine', 'estimated 100,306 overdose deaths', 'addiction and overdose epidemic', 'we can save and transform even more lives']}""}"
