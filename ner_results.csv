"{""Drug overdoses have claimed more than one million lives in the U.S. since 1999, most tied to illicit opioids such as heroin and the nonmedical use of fentanyl. Although people from all walks of life die each day from overdoses, poverty stands out as a driver of this staggering toll. The risk of dying from an overdose is 36 percent higher among people living at or below the poverty line, compared with people living at five times that line, a typical middle class income.\r\nThat’s why expansion of Medicaid, the state and federal health insurance program for low-income individuals, has been hailed as an essential policy to prevent this disproportionate suffering. Implemented in 40 states, Medicaid expansion is a pillar of the Affordable Care Act that extends its coverage to all adults living at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty line (equivalent to a yearly income of $20,120 for an individual). Health insurance can help tackle the overdose crisis because it allows people in need to afford substance use disorder treatment, and treatment is a highly effective way to reduce overdoses.\r\nSo far, however, Medicaid expansion has not fully realized its lifesaving potential for helping to end the overdose epidemic. One reason why is that it takes more than insurance alone to stave off overdoses.\r\nIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.\r\nIn fact, our recent analysis of all overdose deaths in the U.S. from 2008 to 2018 found that Medicaid expansion did not prevent fatal overdoses among people facing poverty; the opioid overdose mortality rate was the same—about 14.5 deaths per 100,000 residents—in states that expanded Medicaid and in states that did not.\r\nThis was not the result we expected.\r\nSo, we dug deeper by analyzing nationwide data gathered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on people who inject drugs. We looked at 19,946 people who subsisted below 138 percent of the poverty line (Medicaid expansion’s eligibility threshold). Some of the states we analyzed had expanded Medicaid, while others had not, allowing us to compare individuals who injected drugs in states that had and had not expanded coverage.\r\nThese comparisons highlight a breakdown in a key pathway that should link Medicaid expansion to improved substance use disorder treatment and thus to reduced overdoses. In a sign of the policy’s success, we found\r\n that insurance coverage rates increased by 19 percentage points among people facing poverty who inject drugs and live in states that had expanded Medicaid, while rates remained unchanged among similar residents of states that had not. Moreover, we also found\r\n people experienced a nine percentage point increase in their probability of getting needed medical care if they lived in expansion states, with no parallel bump in states that did not expand Medicaid.\r\nStrikingly, increased rates of insurance did not,however, lead to increased utilization of substance use disorder treatment; we found\r\n no difference in treatment use across these two groups of people who inject drugs. Other studies have reached similar conclusions.\r\nSo, why might health insurance not be enough to effectively link people to treatment? First, the U.S. has long suffered a marked shortage of treatment slots, so insured individuals who want treatment may still not be able to get it. For example, residential treatment programs operated at 90 percent capacity in 2022, but about three quarters of the people needing treatment that year did not receive it. We need investments to increase treatment capacity, particularly in low-income and rural areas, which have been historically underresourced.\r\nSecond, even with enhanced capacity, Medicaid expansion can only substantially impact overdoses among individuals facing poverty if treatment providers accept its insurance. Unfortunately, in 2020 only 71 percent of treatment facilities nationwide accepted Medicaid. Residents of expansion states do not fare better; a previous study by one of us found\r\n that Medicaid expansion did not result in greater increases in treatment programs accepting Medicaid in expansion states versus states that had not expanded. Low reimbursement rates are a longstanding barrier to provider acceptance of Medicaid. In 2021, the national average Medicaid reimbursement for methadone treatment—a common treatment for opioid use disorder—was nearly half that of Medicare, the federal insurance program for people age 65 and over. This Medicaid–Medicare reimbursement gap was larger than that seen for other services, including primary care. To help ensure that Medicaid expansion truly translates into increased financial access to substance use disorder treatment, policy makers must increase reimbursement for providers.\r\nThese days, people with an opioid use disorder don’t have to rely only on formal programs for treatment; they can also access the pharmaceutical treatment buprenorphine through their primary care physicians and other health care providers. Buprenorphine is a highly effective medication to treat opioid use disorder that also greatly reduces overdose risk. “Secret shopper” studies in which undercover researchers pose as potential patients, however, have found that potential patients struggle to get appointments with physicians who prescribe buprenorphine when they disclose that they are on Medicaid. Increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates, bolstering buprenorphine prescribing among providers within federally qualified health centers (which provide care for low-income individuals) and expanding the role of telemedicine are three pathways toward effectively linking insured people in need to lifesaving treatment.\r\nFinally, even insured individuals who can access treatment may still not be able to use it because of oppressive policies. Methadone, for example, is a highly effective treatment for opioid use disorder that also reduces overdoses. Federal law, however, requires that only specialized clinics can offer it, and that patients must come in person daily for observed medication dosing. These mandates are contemporary practices of the war on drugs, which created barriers to care by punishing even public health programming for drug-related harms. Daily travel to clinics may be impossible for people who have jobs, for people who lack transportation and for those juggling childcare or eldercare. These barriers are common among impoverished people who use drugs, particularly those who are Black, Indigenous or people of color, or those who live in rural communities.\r\nDuring the COVID pandemic, the federal emergency declaration temporarily replaced these punitive policies with a more patient-centered model. Emergency policies permitted some patients to take home up to a 28-day supply of methadone. While this policy has remained in effect even after the federal emergency declaration ended, it is only temporary. The Department of Health and Human Services should make this policy permanent, and support states and treatment programs as they revise policies to support this federal change.\r\nOur study showed expansion was successful at enrolling people facing poverty who use drugs in Medicaid, and that it also helped them access needed medical care. However, our analysis also served as a compelling reminder that insurance coverage alone is insufficient to reverse the overdose crisis for this vulnerable population, because it is not adequately connecting those in need to substance use disorder treatment. We must bolster treatment to meet demand, expand program and provider acceptance of Medicaid, and permanently relax oppressive methadone policies before another million lives are lost.\r\nThis is an opinion and analysis article, and the views expressed by the author or authors are not necessarily those of Scientific American."": ""{\n  'PERSON': ['Vivian Peng'],\n  'DATE': ['1999', '2008 to 2018', '2022', '2020', '2021'],\n  'LOC': ['U.S.', 'low-income and rural areas'],\n  'ORG': ['Medicaid', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention', 'Medicare', 'the Department of Health and Human Services', 'Scientific American'],\n  'PROGRAMS': ['Affordable Care Act', 'Medicaid expansion', 'pharmaceutical treatment buprenorphine', 'federally qualified health centers', 'methadone treatment']\n}""}"
"{'The first wave of funding from multibillion dollar settlements with the opioid industry will go toward expanding treatment programs, increasing the availability of supportive housing for people with substance use disorders, reversing racial disparities in overdose deaths and providing relief for families devastated by the unrelenting opioid epidemic, according to a plan unveiled Friday by Boston Mayor Michelle Wu and the Boston Public Health Commission.\r\nThe new strategies include the creation of a Family Overdose Support Fund, which will provide financial support to Boston families who have lost a loved one to an opioid overdose. The fund will launch later this year with $250,000 to cover child care, funeral expenses, legal services, and other financial burdens faced by those with firsthand experience with the deadly scourge.\r\nThe grief and trauma of losing a loved one to overdose has a lasting impact on our communities, Wu said in a written statement. This fund will help support our families and our communities by easing the financial burdens that undermine a healthy grieving process.\r\nThe announcement culminates months of planning and deliberation by the Boston Public Health Commission, and comes as local and state governments nationwide struggle to reverse year after year of rising overdose fatalities. So far, Boston has collected $6 million through legal settlements from opioid manufacturers and distributors the most of any municipality in the state. Yet like many cities and towns across Massachusetts, Boston has not spent any of the money as it has grappled with how to address the public health disaster.\r\nApart from the new fund, the city did not lay out specific spending amounts for the other proposed investments.\r\nBoston, which ultimately expects to receive $22 million through 2038 from the legal settlements, has taken a deliberative approach to deploying the settlement funds, first seeking input directly from Boston residents and those directly affected by the overdose crisis. Since last summer, the commission has collected more than 400 submissions from an online survey and held eight listening sessions around Boston with more than 200 participants. A majority of respondents wanted to prioritize the needs of grieving families by providing direct financial support, the health commission said.\r\nThere is an overwhelming need to hold these drug manufacturers accountable, said Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, the executive director of the Boston Public Health Commission. And I think that, if allocated appropriately, these funds could help right tragic wrongs, they could save lives, and ... mitigate some of those ongoing harms.\r\nMassachusetts expects to receive almost $1 billion over 18 years from settlements with opioid manufacturers and distributors sued for their roles in the nations staggering toll of overdoses, which remain near record highs and claimed more than 2,300 lives in Massachusetts in 2022.\r\nForty percent of the money is being distributed among municipalities, with the dollar amount based on such factors as the number of opioid-related deaths and the amount of opioids flowing into that community, calculated by population. The remaining 60 percent is being deposited into the statewide Opioid Recovery and Remediation Fund, overseen by the state Executive Office of Health and Human Services.\r\nUnder an agreement, cities and towns that receive the settlement money must spend it on substance abuse prevention, treatment, recovery programs, support for pregnant women with opioid use disorder, as well as harm-reduction strategies that seek to reduce a drug users risk of getting sick or dying, among other strategies.\r\nMassachusetts is slated to receive another $90 million under a separate 2021 settlement deal with Purdue Pharma, producer of OxyContin; but that deal has been held up as the US Supreme Court weighs whether the companys former owners, the wealthy Sackler family, can be shielded from civil lawsuits under the terms of its bankruptcy deal.\r\nIn 2022, 352 people died from opioid overdoses in Boston, up nearly 7 percent from the previous year and more than quadruple the number from a decade ago. From 2019 to 2022, Boston experienced a 36 percent increase in opioid related deaths, more than twice the statewide rate of increase (16 percent) over the same time period. The crisis is disproportionately affecting Black and Hispanic people: Overdose fatalities among Black residents of Boston soared by 29 percent last year, according to state data.\r\nThe increase in overdose deaths has been propelled by the increasingly toxic illicit drug supply, the proliferation of the cheap and highly potent opioid fentanyl, which is deadly even in tiny amounts, and the mixing of opioids with stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine.\r\nOne of the reasons that it took us a long time ... to do this community engagement process is that we wanted to make sure that we were inclusive of communities that have been disproportionately impacted and sometimes left out, Ojikutu said. All of these things have made it so incredibly important that we also acknowledge their desires and needs.\r\nChris Serres can be reached at chris.serres@globe.com.

"{'The National Institutes of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) with other NIH Institutes and Centers (ICs), intends to publish a new Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) to solicit applications for multi-PI team-based, challenging, high impact projects to improve understanding of mechanisms of chronic pain in children and adolescents and to accelerate the development of age appropriate, patient/family centered prevention and therapeutic approaches. This research will seek to advance an integrated understanding of the biological, psychological, and social factors that contribute to pediatric chronic pain. NIH is interested in pain research in infants, children, and adolescents that includes those with intellectual and physical disabilities and/or those who experience health disparities (e.g., diverse race/ethnicity, sexual and gender minorities, socioeconomically disadvantaged, medically underserved communities, people with limited English proficiency). NIH encourages applicants to consider community-engaged research and interdisciplinary, collaborative applications to be developed in partnership with patient communities and/or community organizations where possible. \xa0The long-term goal is to develop improved knowledge of specific pediatric pain conditions as well as pain associated with diverse diseases/disorders, to improve understanding of pain in the context of child development and to facilitate the stratification of patients with specific pain conditions and co-morbidities to accelerate chronic pain prevention and therapeutic clinical trials.\r\nThis Notice is being provided to allow potential applicants sufficient time to develop meaningful collaborations and responsive projects.\xa0\r\nThe NOFO is expected to be published in May 2024 with an expected application due date in Fall 2024.\r\nThis NOFO will utilize the UC2 Research Project Cooperative Agreements activity code. Details of the planned NOFO are provided below.\xa0\r\nThis effort is part of the NIH HEAL (Helping to End Addiction Long-term ®) Initiative to speed the development and implementation of scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative will bolster research across NIH to (1) improve treatment and prevention of opioid misuse and opioid use disorder and (2) enhance pain management. More information and periodic updates about the Initiative are available at: https://heal.nih.gov/.Pain in infants, children, and adolescents is common, often under-recognized, inconsistently assessed or measured, and inadequately treated. Moreover, the relationship between pain and human development and any potential effects of repeated pain experiences on future pain and physical dependency remain largely understudied. The NIH HEAL Initiative recognizes the need to support emerging research opportunities of broad scope and complexity in pain that require innovative team science approaches. This concept, as part of a suite of NIH HEAL Initiative programs, represents a major new effort to enhance pain management in pediatric populations. The goal of HEAL KIDS (Knowledge, Innovation and Discovery Studies) Pain initiative is to advance the understanding, assessment, measurement, treatment, and prevention of pain in infants, children, and adolescents, including those with disabilities and/or experiencing health disparities. The infrastructure, resources and knowledge created through this initial effort will inform ongoing and future HEAL Pain projects and facilitate the inclusion of pediatric populations across the spectrum of HEAL funded research.\xa0\r\nStructureThe current HEAL KIDS Pain organizational structure includes two interrelated programs, each addressing a critical area of pediatric pain research. \xa0The Acute Pain Clinical Trials (APT) Program will focus on supporting research to improve the assessment, management, and treatment of acute pain in pediatric patients through innovative clinical trials (RFA-HD-24-011). The Chronic Pain Collaborating Teams (CPT) Program will support team science research projects to advance understanding of mechanisms of chronic pain in children and adolescents. Both programs will use a common Resource and Data Center to provide clinical trial coordinating activities and to facilitate standardization, harmonization, and collaborative data analysis (RFA-HD-24-012). \xa0The APT and the CPT studies will integrate relevant behavioral and social influences and contexts of pain experiences. These may include but are not limited to: inclusion of social, environmental and other influences on the incidence of pain, the perception and experience of pain, and the pain reporting. The impact on families and caregivers and how that relates to pain experiences and reporting should also be considered. Integration of behavioral and social sciences in pain research is critical to fully understanding pain experiences, addressing disparities, and developing effective interventions. The overall goal of this initiative is to advance pediatric pain research by providing a framework for synergies across acute pain clinical trials and chronic pain studies and facilitate understanding of acute to chronic pain transition.\r\nThe HEAL KIDS CPT program is intended to support team-based, cross-cutting research approaches that combine clinical research, novel/cutting edge technologies, and measurement science into one platform, which will enhance our understanding of primary and secondary chronic pain processing in children and adolescents. Furthermore, it will expand our capacity to pursue challenging problems in basic biological understanding, therapeutics development and effective management of pediatric pain conditions.\r\nEffective and safe treatments and multidisciplinary strategies are needed for moderate to severe primary chronic pain as well as refractory chronic pain in children with chronic diseases. Improving pain management, mental health, and functioning, while eliminating risk of opioid dependence, would be a major advance for pediatric patients. Importantly, successful treatment and prevention of chronic pain in children would diminish the potential for persistence of these pain conditions into adulthood. The reduced need for opioids in children and adolescents would also reduce the potential for addiction or misuse later in life.\xa0This Notice encourages teams of investigators in multiple disciplines to pursue coordinated research that integrates diverse areas of expertise under one umbrella, including but not limited to:\r\n<ul><li>Pediatric clinical pain management</li><li>Clinical pain research</li><li>Preclinical/basic pain biology and modeling</li><li>Human psychology</li><li>Specific disease and/or pathological conditions\xa0</li><li>Artificial Intelligence</li><li>Data science\xa0</li></ul>The research teams are expected to address a significant scientific challenge that requires collaboration, synergy, knowledge integration and team interactions. Teams are encouraged to consider transformative objectives and design projects that would lead to new, innovative, and improved strategies to enhance understanding of chronic pain mechanisms at the individual level, resolve heterogeneity in patient populations in relation to the pain experience in the context of chronic diseases and conditions, and generate and validate evidence for chronic pain patient stratification. \xa0The work should aim to test powerful tools, models and approaches to accelerate the development and translation of pain condition-specific efficacious therapeutics, and next-generation clinical management of pain.\xa0Projects should be focused on a specific pain condition, including but not limited to primary chronic pain, painful neuropathy, musculoskeletal pain, headache, chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, eye pain, sickle-cell pain, post-surgical pain, cancer pain, visceral pain and gynecologic pain. Painful disorders of the orofacial region, pain co-occurring with substance-use disorders, and other conditions will also be considered.\xa0\r\nExamples of pediatric pain research in the context of the CPT program include, but are not limited to:\xa0\r\n<ul><li>Exploring mechanisms of pain in children and adolescents, including studies to define the neurobiology of pain mechanisms in children and how they change with age, investigate the sex differences in pain mechanisms, and determine the effects of pain on the developing brain.\xa0</li><li>Identifying risk factors and underlying mechanisms that may predispose to chronic pediatric pain, including identification of early childhood factors that increase pain vulnerability and affect pain management.\xa0</li><li>Developing evidence for new approaches to preventing the acute to chronic pain transition in children and adolescents.</li><li>Examining large-scale data resources and big data approaches to discover an array of multi-level factors (biologic, clinical, psychosocial, behavioral, cultural, social, structural) related to pediatric chronic pain, and new patterns and trends that may translate to novel, targeted interventions for pediatric chronic pain.</li><li>Evaluating and clinically validating age-appropriate measures, tools, and technologies for the assessment of chronic pain across the continuum of care.</li></ul>\xa0Applicants are strongly encouraged to consult with NIH program staff as plans for an application are being developed.\r\nApplications are not being solicited at this time.': ""{'PERSON': ['None'], 'DATE': ['May 2024', 'Fall 2024'], 'LOC': ['None'], 'ORG': ['The National Institutes of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'NIAMS', 'NIH Institutes and Centers', 'ICs', 'NIH', 'HEAL KIDS', 'Acute Pain Clinical Trials', 'APT', 'Chronic Pain Collaborating Teams', 'CPT'], 'PROGRAMS': ['Notice of Funding Opportunity', 'NOFO', 'NIH HEAL (Helping to End Addiction Long-term ®) Initiative', 'HEAL KIDS (Knowledge, Innovation and Discovery Studies) Pain initiative','Resource and Data Center', 'HEAL KIDS Pain organizational structure', 'APT Program', 'CPT Program', 'HEAL KIDS CPT program']}""}"
"{'Fatal drug overdoses had been slowly rising for a decade, but when the number of Coloradans killed by fentanyl soared during the first two years of the pandemic, state leaders, law enforcement officials, public health managers — even ordinary people — called for drastic action.\r\nHoping to stem the loss of life, lawmakers took the controversial step in 2022 of making it a felony to possess even a small amount of fentanyl, the synthetic opioid responsible for most of the state’s fatal overdoses.\r\nSchools and colleges began stocking the overdose-reversal medication naloxone. Families and friends of people killed by fentanyl rallied for more treatment resources. Nonprofits conducted educational campaigns about the dangers of counterfeit medications, advising “one pill can kill.”\r\nColorado’s quiet killer\r\nAlcohol-related deaths in Colorado spiked during the pandemic, and the state ranks as one of the worst for deaths due to drinking. In this four-part series, The Denver Post examines why so many Coloradans are dying, and ways to save lives that the state hasn’t pursued.\r\nClick here to read more from this series.\r\nYet at the same time, another drug quietly fueled its own surge in fatalities in Colorado.\r\nDeaths from alcohol in Colorado shot up more than 60%\xa0between 2018 and 2021, falling slightly in 2022 — as did fatal overdoses. But alcohol fatalities are still 50% above\xa0pre-COVID levels, and experts fear Coloradans’ heavier drinking since 2020 will continue to exact a deadly cost in the years to come.\r\nAlcohol killed 1,547 people statewide in 2022 — fewer than the 1,799 who died of overdoses — but that narrowly defined figure only includes certain types of organ damage and complications of withdrawal. Factor in deaths from long-term complications of drinking, and estimates put alcohol’s annual toll in this state at roughly twice that number.\r\nColoradans die from the effects of alcohol at one of the highest rates in the country, but, in comparison to fentanyl, the state’s reaction has been a shrug. Legislators haven’t seriously considered measures to discourage drinking, and voters expanded access to alcohol in grocery stores. Gov. Jared Polis said he considers drinking a matter of personal responsibility.\r\nThe Denver Post is publishing a four-part series this week examining why Colorado consistently ranks among the worst for alcohol-related deaths. The state hasnt raised alcohol taxes or done anything to restrict access — steps that can reduce deaths. And while treatment is available in Colorado, information about how to access it hasnt always reached families searching for help.\r\nRep. Marc Snyder, a Colorado Springs Democrat and chair of the House committee that oversees the state’s alcohol regulation said he found it “pretty shocking” to learn alcohol-related deaths are comparable to drug overdoses in Colorado. \r\n“We kind of forget about alcohol,” he said.\r\nOf course, alcohol and harder drugs like fentanyl also have important differences.\r\nThe fact that more people die from alcohol overall reflects that far more people use it. A single, more potent-than-expected dose of fentanyl can kill a user, while heavy drinking can take decades to claim a life. And the two drugs’ secondary effects are difficult to compare: illicit fentanyl brings violent crime from drug trafficking, while alcohol can increase the odds that personal disputes end in assault or murder.\r\nRepresentatives for the alcohol industry said government intervention isn’t an answer to the growing problem of excessive drinking in Colorado. The state would do better to focus on screening and referring people who need help to treatment as needed, said Amanda Berger, vice president of science and health at the Distilled Spirits Council.\xa0Raising taxes will just push drinkers to use cheaper products, she said.\r\n“Tax hikes will unfairly raise the cost on responsible consumers and harm hospitality businesses still trying to rebound from the pandemic amid a host of new challenges, including inflation and staff shortages,” Berger said in a statement.\r\nClick to enlarge\r\nOnly about half of Americans drink on a regular basis, but surveys have shown those who do are more educated and affluent — the kind of people who make the laws, said David Jernigan, a Boston University professor of health law, policy and management who has studied alcohol marketing. Theyre less willing to regulate a socially acceptable drug thats popular in their circles than they are to take a stand against tobacco or opioids, he said.\r\nLawmakers in charge of regulating alcohol said they were surprised to hear that the number of people dying from drinking was even comparable to deaths from other drugs. They, and the governors office, pointed to Colorado’s efforts to stop underaged people from drinking and to reduce impaired driving.\r\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attributed only about 8% of Colorados alcohol deaths to car crashes, however — fewer than liver disease, cardiovascular problems or suicide. Reducing underage drinking could help stem the tide of deaths, but any effects would be decades in the future. While people who start drinking as teens are at a higher risk for alcohol-related problems, most die in their 50s or later.\r\nFor a long time, moderate drinking was considered healthy, or at least not something to worry about. That’s contributed to confusion, because, unlike smokers, regular drinkers don’t know what theyre consuming could hurt them, said Dr. Bill Burman, former director of the Public Health Institute at Denver Health.\r\nSomeone who drinks a six-pack of beer on a Saturday night doesn’t necessarily see that as unsafe, even though studies show it increases their risk of premature death, he said.\r\n“I think almost everyone recognizes that severe alcoholism is a problem, that person who’s falling down on the street,” but most people who drink aren’t aware they could be at risk, he said.\r\nThe alcohol industry has been quite successful in keeping the focus on the most extreme drinkers, Jernigan said. When someone picks up a pack of cigarettes, they see a warning label that clearly outlines specific diseases they’re risking, but the alcohol label only states that drinking may cause birth defects or interfere with driving, and “may cause health problems.”\r\n“That doesn’t tell you anything,” he said. “You don’t think of alcohol as a factor in heart attacks, as a factor in cognitive decline.”\r\nA runner speeds past advertisements for alcoholic beverages at a liquor store along Colfax Avenue in Denver on Jan. 3, 2024. (Photo by Helen H. Richardson/The Denver Post)\r\nLack of a legislative response\r\nColorado lawmakers havent hesitated to regulate some drug threats.\r\nIn addition to making possession of one gram of fentanyl a felony, the state legislature also recently raised the minimum age to buy tobacco to 21 and took steps to reduce youth access to marijuana. Legislators limited the amount of high-potency cannabis products an individual can purchase each day and required a more extensive relationship before a physician can sign off on a medical marijuana card.\r\nClick to enlarge\r\nNothing similar has been proposed to reduce alcohol use, even as alcohol-related deaths spiked in Colorado.\r\nIn 2018, the State Epidemiological Outcomes Workgroup laid out four strategies to lessen the impact of excessive drinking: reducing the density of businesses selling alcohol, raising alcohol taxes, limiting the hours when alcohol can be sold and increasing liability for selling alcohol to someone who’s underage or already intoxicated.\r\nThe state hasn’t done any of those things. Instead, the density of outlets selling alcohol has increased, and the state may extend the hours during which restaurant and bar patrons can drink alcohol next year. In 2022, voters approved Proposition 125, which allowed grocery stores to sell wine, further expanding on a 2019 change that allowed grocers to sell full-strength beer.\r\nThat’s not unusual, Jernigan said: passing new alcohol taxes is difficult anywhere, and cities get significant pressure to offer more alcohol licenses as a way to recruit businesses and revitalize struggling areas. Of course, that argument doesn’t account for the costs of increased drinking, such as higher rates of police calls and emergency room visits, he said.\r\nHealth and safety is Polis’s “top priority,” and the state has been successful in decreasing underage drinking, said Conor Cahill, a spokesman for the governor. The Colorado Department of Public Safety also provides training to local law enforcement on impaired driving, he said.\r\n“Gov. Polis believes in personal responsibility,” Cahill said. “The state continues to invest in substance-use disorder treatment and alcohol risk education resources, and, ultimately, legal adults have the right to safely and responsibly access alcohol as long as they don’t risk public safety.”\r\nA number of groups representing the alcohol industry, including the Colorado Brewers Guild, Colorado Beer Distributors Association, the Colorado Cider Guild and Molson Coors either declined to comment or didn’t respond to The Post’s requests for an interview.\r\nMicki Hackenberger, executive director of the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of Colorado, said the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights — which requires all tax increases to go before voters — and the ability of local governments to decide where alcohol should be sold limit the state’s ability to make sweeping changes. That said, Colorado has taken steps to reduce deaths through the Task Force on Drunk and Impaired Driving and with efforts to expand training for bartenders and wait staff, she said.\r\n“They actually have done a lot,” Hackenberger said. “Safety is an issue that I think everybody is concerned about.”\r\nA display of wine is set up in front of the meat and fish department at a Safeway store on March 1, 2023, in Aurora.

(Photo by RJ Sangosti/The Denver Post)\r\nThe state might pay more attention to alcohol in the near future, since an interim legislative committee proposed a bill that would limit how wine and beer can be displayed in grocery stores, said Raquel Garcia, a member of the Colorado Behavioral Health Administration’s advisory committee.\r\nGarcia said pushing for action on alcohol is difficult, though, because selling it is so profitable, and people who aren’t in addiction recovery haven’t considered it a priority. And, of course, the deaths caused by alcohol are quieter than when someone overdoses on opioids in public.\r\n“We’ve allowed (alcohol) to creep into every segment of our society,” she said. “I think in Colorado, we’ve been irresponsible.”\r\nPandemic increase in deaths hasn’t ended\r\nColorado has recorded higher-than-average rates of alcohol-related deaths than the country as a whole since at least 2009, and had the sixth-highest rate in 2021, according to an analysis by KFF, the health policy research organization formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation.\r\nThe KFF data, like the states, only includes deaths caused by behavioral health symptoms related to alcohol, like psychosis or withdrawal; alcohol poisoning; and certain alcohol-induced conditions affecting the liver, pancreas, heart, nervous system and stomach.\r\nThe CDC estimates include a broader range of causes, and have generally been about double the state’s numbers, but aren’t calculated every year.\r\nColorado’s alcohol deaths started rising steadily around 2015, then jumped dramatically in 2020 and 2021. In 2022, they dropped from their pandemic high of 1,653, but still were up 50% compared to 2018. The trend persisted even after adjusting for population growth and aging.\r\n“Everyone thought (the increase in alcohol-related deaths) was COVID and the pandemic, and we thought it would go back down,” said Joseph Schacht, a clinical psychologist who studies alcohol at the University of Colorado’s Anschutz Medical Campus.\r\nSo far, however, it appears many people have continued to drink at elevated levels, pushing those whose bodies had already sustained some damage into serious illness, he said.\r\nEmily Marberry, of Denver, believes the pandemic contributed to her husband Rick Gildar’s death from liver failure, at just 36.\r\nGildar was a “super smart” software engineer who could take anything apart and put it back together, and taught himself how to play the guitar, his wife said. But he also had social anxieties and depression that he soothed with alcohol. He went to detox centers two or three times and avoided alcohol for a few months each time, but then would decide he could safely drink again and start the cycle over, she said.\r\nThe forced isolation of the first months of the pandemic didn’t help his mental state, Marberry said, and he was discouraged when a rehab facility turned him away in May 2020, saying he was too sick to manage. He stopped drinking for a few months before his death later that year to try to get on the liver transplant list, but it was too late to undo the damage, she said.\r\n“I think those things that happened would make him feel more defeated, and he would drink more,” she said.\r\nAlcohol, suicide deaths related in the West\r\nThe states with alcohol-related death rates even higher than Colorados in 2021 were also in the West: New Mexico, South Dakota, Alaska, Wyoming and Montana.\r\nPart of that simply reflects that people living in Western states tend to drink more. With the exception of the period from about 2009 to 2017, the West has had the highest per capita alcohol consumption of any region since the 1970s.\r\n“Heavier-drinking states are going to have higher rates of alcohol-related deaths,” Schacht said.\r\nColoradans 14 and older drank an average of about three gallons of pure alcohol in 2021, spread out across beer, wine and liquor. That was the ninth-highest consumption rate in the country.\r\nThe states residents also reported binge-drinking — five or more drinks on one occasion for a man, or four or more for a woman — at higher rates than Americans overall. About 19% of Colorado adults reported binge drinking in 2022, and 8% reported consistently exceeding the guideline that men have only two drinks a day and women have only one, according to CDC data.\r\nMore people likely exceed the healthy drinking guidelines, though, because a cocktail that an average person would consider one drink might contain multiple shots, making it several drinks in the CDC’s eyes.\r\nFrom the early 1980s to the mid-1990s, average alcohol consumption was trending down in Colorado, but that reversed for unclear reasons. By 2021, the average Coloradan was drinking about 25% more than in 1999. In the same period, consumption increased about 16% nationwide and 15% in the Western region.\r\nDrinking heavily seems to be part of the culture in the West in a way that it isn’t in other parts of the country, Denver Health’s Burman said. While studies generally have described a consistent pattern of heavier drinking in the West, researchers haven’t established why that might be.\r\nThe combination is particularly bad, though, given the suicide rate in the Western states, Burman said. Gun ownership is also higher in the West, and using a firearm increases the odds that a suicide attempt will end in death.\r\nA state report found that about 42% of people who died by suicide from 2011 to 2015 and had toxicology information had alcohol in their systems at the time of their deaths. About 28% were legally intoxicated. So far, the states suicide prevention programs havent mentioned alcohol as a risk factor or suggested that people at risk be discouraged from drinking.\r\n“Alcohol lowers that threshold for doing something rash, and that can include suicide,” Burman said.\r\n“A brutal disease”\r\nWhile alcohol is directly toxic to cells at very high concentrations, most of its health effects seem to come from increasing inflammation in the body, CU Anschutz’s Schacht said.\r\nOver time, that inflammation contributes to cancers or directly causes scarring on organs like the liver, he said. While red wine contains some antioxidant compounds, it doesn’t have high enough concentrations to outweigh the damage caused by the alcohol.\r\nOn average, mortality starts to rise significantly when men have about three drinks per day and when women have about two drinks per day, according to a study compiling the available data. People who drank less, or only had alcohol occasionally, didn’t see a significant rise or decline in overall mortality, though the risk of specific diseases rises at lower levels.\r\nCalculating how many people died because of alcohol use is less straightforward when they had illnesses with multiple risk factors, such as breast or throat cancer, strokes, or improper heart rhythms, Schacht said. Researchers have to come up with estimates based on the number of people who died of relevant causes, and how much heavy drinking increases the risk of those conditions, he said.\r\n“There’s certainly a percentage of breast cancer deaths that are attributable to alcohol, but you’ll never see alcohol as a cause on a death certificate” for someone who died of cancer, he said.\r\nUsing the CDCs more expansive definition, about 18% of deaths in Colorado of adults 20 to 64 were related to excessive drinking between 2015 and 2019, behind only New Mexico, Alaska and Wyoming. The odds that a death involved alcohol were even higher for adults under 35, with drinking listed as a factor for more than 28% of Coloradans in that age group who died.\r\nWhile many will still choose to drink, people need accurate information about risk so they can make decisions, as they do when considering whether to try a dangerous sport, Schacht said.\r\n“Really, any level of alcohol use is not great for your health,” he said.\r\nOn average, people who die of alcohol-related causes lose about 30 years of potential life, according to a 2021 report from the state health department. That puts them in their prime years for earning income and raising families.\r\nAndrea Carter, of Highlands Ranch, said that in some ways she felt like a single mother even before her husband Matt died of liver disease at 39.\r\nAndrea Carter, right, and her daughter Ashley, 14, visit Golden Gate Canyon State Park near Black Hawk on Saturday, Sept. 30, 2023. The family spread the ashes of Matt Carter — Andreas husband and Ashleys father — near the site. (Photo by Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post)\r\nMatt wasn’t a bad person, she said — he was a blast when they were students at Colorado State University and loved the two daughters they had together — but as his drinking escalated over time, he wasn’t emotionally able to be present as a father. Sometimes, she’d take their daughters to their grandparents’ house when he was drinking, because while he was never violent, he’d rapidly lose patience and snap at them.\r\nHe sought residential treatment in 2014 and 2015, but the longest stretch he went without alcohol was when he broke both shoulders and couldn’t drive, Carter said. At the time, she said she didn’t know the neurobiology underlying addiction and thought he just wasn’t willing to stop for his family.\r\nIt was only after he died in 2018 that Carter told their daughters, who were then 8 and 11, that he would have chosen something different if he could have.\r\n“I don’t wish it on my worst enemy. It’s a brutal disease,” she said.\r\nREAD PART 2:Colorado has some of the lowest alcohol taxes and highest drinking deaths.

"{'A bill set to be unveiled in the Colorado legislature would levy a new fee on businesses that produce alcoholic beverages, then direct tens of millions of dollars collected each year to addiction treatment and recovery programs.\r\nSen. Kevin Priola, a Democrat from Henderson, said he plans to introduce legislation Wednesday to create a “state enterprise” that would collect a fee from alcohol producers and wholesalers, with some exceptions for small companies.\r\nThe enterprise is expected to generate more than $100 million a year, and would funnel 80% of that money toward alcohol addiction treatment and recovery programs, according to the bill’s sponsors.\xa0Funds also would go toward prevention programs, harm reduction, impaired driving enforcement, or services for people born with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and to offset the cost of collecting the fee and doling out the grants.\r\nColorado consistently has one of the highest rates of deaths related to excessive drinking in the country, as The Denver Post illustrated in a four-part series earlier this year that examined alcohol’s impact on public health in the state.\r\nBy the most conservative count, which includes only deaths from organ damage by alcohol and complications of withdrawal, drinking killed 1,547 people in Colorado in 2022. Thats more than a 50% increase compared to 2018, and the actual toll may be twice as high, because drinking increases the risk of multiple cancers and heart problems.\r\nAbout two-thirds of people seeking substance-use disorder treatment in Colorado list alcohol as either their primary problem or one drug among several that they misuse, Priola said.\r\n“Not only is it one of the largest substance-use disorders Coloradans are struggling with, it’s growing,” he said.\r\nThe Colorado Brewers Guild said it couldn’t comment on pending legislation, but questioned funding addiction treatment through an alcohol fee, particularly since beer consumption has gradually declined in recent years.\r\n“Hundreds of thousands of Coloradoans responsibly enjoy our craft beer as part of an active and social lifestyle,” the guild said in a statement.\r\nThe Distilled Spirits Council of the United States said it estimated that a new fee would reduce sales in Colorado by $220 million and cost 2,600 jobs, without reducing excessive alcohol use. In a statement, the group said it would support efforts to screen patients for alcohol misuse and to refer them to treatment.\r\n“Penalizing responsible alcohol consumers and an already struggling hospitality industry while failing to address the actual problem makes no sense,” the statement said.\r\nWhile many people do enjoy alcohol without negative effects, it is an addictive product and people who have been drinking excessively can’t always stop, Priola said. The fee would help offset some of the societal costs of unhealthy drinking, he said.\r\nIn 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that unhealthy alcohol use cost Colorado about $5 billion, mostly due to lost productivity.\r\n“I would argue that this is personal responsibility for the industry,” he said.\r\nState enterprises essentially allow the legislature to avoid the cumbersome process of asking voters for a tax increase as required by the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, within certain bounds. While they can receive some state and local revenue, enterprises act like government-owned businesses, charging fees for a service — though not always one that entities paying the fee can opt out of. For example, a state enterprise collects a fee on Colorado hospitals and uses that money to draw down federal funds for health care.\r\nUsually, an enterprise would have to go on the ballot if it realistically could collect more than $100 million in its first five years, but the bill’s language would exempt the Alcohol Impact Enterprise Fund because it addresses an urgent public health need, said co-sponsor Sen. Chris Hansen, a Denver Democrat.\r\nThe model is similar to how the state mitigates the effects of other legal, but potentially addictive, industries, Hansen said.\r\n“This is close to what we do with marijuana. It’s what we do with problem gambling,” he said.\r\nPriola said he and others have been working on the idea for at least three years, but the timing finally seems right with federal COVID-19 relief funds drying up. The enterprise would continue indefinitely, unlike federal funds, and the legislature couldn’t take money from it to balance the general budget in difficult years, he said.\r\n“We’re trying to create a sustainable funding source,” he said.\r\nThe bill lays out fees of 16 cents for every gallon of beer or hard cider; 15 cents for every liter of wine; and $1.21 for every liter of spirits. The enterprise’s board could vote to raise the fees every two years, based on the inflation rate, population growth and increases in alcohol consumption.\r\nAssuming that manufacturers and wholesalers pass on the fee entirely, the combined excise taxes and fees on a typical can of beer would rise from about 0.7 cents to about 1.5 cents, Hansen said.\r\n“For consumers, they are likely to not notice this at all,” he said.\r\nColorado would still be near the middle of the states on alcohol-specific taxes and fees, Priola said. The state currently has some of the lowest excise taxes on alcohol in the country. While higher taxes aren’t a guarantee that people will drink less, drunken driving accidents dropped the last time the federal government raised its taxes.\r\nJosé Esquibel, a longtime member of the Colorado Substance Abuse Trend and Response Task Force who consulted with the senators, said the model they’re proposing has precedents in how states responded to the opioid crisis of the mid-2000s. Minnesota increased the licensing fees it requires of opioid manufacturers that sell their products in the state, and New York added a per-milligram tax on prescribed opioids.\r\nThe proposed increase is small enough that it isn’t likely to drive people to reduce their drinking, but it will give the state more resources to respond, Esquibel said. Coming up with a stable funding source is particularly important for services that health insurance doesn’t cover, like prevention programs and support for people in recovery, he said.\r\n“People may go through a treatment program for a smaller amount of time,” he said. “They’re going to be in recovery for the rest of their lives.”\r\nSign up for our weekly newsletter to get health news sent straight to your inbox.': ""{'PERSON': ['Sen.

"{""It is no longer the 1960s, and there is no longer the same stigma against the treatment of mental health, said GOP Rep. Michael Burgess, a doctor representing Dallas affluent northern suburbs who sponsored a House bill to change the rule.\r\nThe House passed it Dec. 12. It would give states the option to treat Medicaid patients suffering from addiction for up to a month in a mental hospital on the governments dime. The Senate Finance Committee approved a similar provision in November, so its prospects of enactment are good.\r\nBurgess co-sponsor was Ritchie Torres, a Democrat from New York Citys poorest section, the South Bronx, \r\nwho has spent time in the hospital for his own mental health struggles.\r\nPublic health groups including the Treatment Advocacy Center and the National Alliance on Mental Illness, as well as state Medicaid directors, support the change.\r\nThey say the 1965 rule barring Medicaid, the federal-state health care program for the poor and lower-middle income, from funding hospital treatment has had unintended consequences: a lack of psychiatric beds for people who need them. Instead, they said, many vulnerable people end up on the streets, in emergency rooms, in jails or dead.\r\nThey say the policy also \r\nperpetuates discrimination against people who suffer from drug addiction and mental illness compared to those with physical conditions, for which theres no such exclusion.\r\nRepublicans in Congress agree. Democrats are divided.\r\nNew Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee that shepherded the bill, resisted the change, wary of a return to institutionalizing people with mental illness instead of caring for them in their homes, ideally, with a team of specialized health and social workers.\r\nWe know that one of the best ways to help people in recovery is to ensure they have access to care in their communities, he said.\r\nPallone ultimately relented because Republicans agreed to improve Medicaid coverage for some incarcerated people with substance use disorder.\r\nA police car leaves a psychiatric hospital in Washington in September 2016.\r\n|\r\nPreston Keres/AFP via Getty Images\r\nBut fears of reinstitutionalization have also animated civil rights advocates who support the restriction on Medicaid funds. They fear a slippery slope back to warehousing the sick and point to states like California and New York that are already experimenting with forcing patients into care.\r\nLifting the Medicaid rule would reduce pressure to do whats really needed, said Lewis Bossing, senior staff attorney at the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law: increase services in communities.\r\nPeople have better outcomes in terms of reduced hospitalization rates, reduced criminal legal system involvement, increased employment, increased measures of social integration when theyre served in the community, versus having to be at an institution to get care, he said.\r\nThe rise and fall of the mental hospital\r\nStates started building mental health hospitals in the 1800s, aiming to \r\nprovide people with severe mental illness with care instead of throwing them in jail.\r\nBut \r\nthe hospitals soon became overcrowded, understaffed and underfinanced. Abuse was rife, according to an \r\ninvestigation published in Life Magazine in 1946: Patients were restrained for days, thrown into solitary confinement, starved and sometimes beaten to death.\r\nMore than half a million people were in state mental health hospitals in 1963, half of them in facilities housing more than 3,000 people, President John F. Kennedy said \r\nin a speech that year.\r\nKennedy laid out a plan for states to build comprehensive community mental health centers, with federal support. They would combine diagnostic services, emergency psychiatric units, inpatient and outpatient services and rehabilitation.\r\nThe law establishing Medicaid two years later prohibited federal money from paying for care in mental health care facilities with more than 16 beds to avoid pouring money into what Kennedy called outdated institutional care. The rule now covers people between 21 and 64 years old.\r\nMany state hospitals closed but the community mental health system, as Kennedy envisioned it, never came to fruition, advocates on both sides of the debate say.\r\nThose who dont want the Medicaid funding ban repealed would like states and the federal government to focus on building that system, while those who want to see the policy gone say both community and hospital care are needed to provide people with what they need, depending on their circumstances.\r\nA person diagnosed with mental illness and substance use disorder needs inpatient care for doctors to stabilize them, argued Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), a gastroenterologist and top member of the two committees with power over the policy.\r\nThe people who were so opposed to this because they still want to do it in an outpatient [facility], you wonder if theyve ever actually lived with somebody who is seriously psychotic, Cassidy said.\r\nAdvocates argue that repealing the Medicaid policy is needed to provide people with the best treatment options.\r\n|\r\nOlivier Douliery/AFP via Getty Images\r\nOver the last decade, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has started allowing states to use federal dollars to pay for care in mental health hospitals for a limited time, as long as they obtain a waiver. Thirty-six \r\nstates now have a waiver to treat people with substance use disorder and a dozen states have a waiver for treating other mental illnesses in psychiatric hospitals.\r\nCalifornia found that its waiver to provide medication-assisted treatment for people with substance use disorder in mental hospitals helped individuals who need a relatively intensive level of care for short-term stabilization of acute needs, said Ann Carroll, the California Department of Health Care Services spokesperson.\r\nEven so, the system as it stands is failing to provide state-of-the-art care to many patients. One-third of the 1.5 million Medicaid enrollees with opioid use disorder, for example, \r\ndid not receive medication treatment in 2021, according to the HHS inspector general.\r\nThe 2018 SUPPORT Act, a landmark law meant to provide prevention, treatment and recovery for people with opioid addiction, gave states a new, albeit temporary, choice to provide care in psychiatric hospitals for up to a month without having to obtain a waiver.\r\nThat option, which only South Dakota and Tennessee have taken, expired in September. The SUPPORT Act reauthorization bill the House passed in mid-December would reup the option and make it permanent.\r\nPallone argued at a House Energy and Commerce hearing this summer that the low uptake showed that the waivers were sufficient. But Burgess and other Republicans said the waivers were burdensome and that making the option permanent would incentivize more states to use it.\r\nThe Senate Finance Committee also voted in November to \r\nmake the option permanent. Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), \r\nwho introduced the legislation with Republican Sens. John Thune of South Dakota and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, emphasized the 30-day limit and the requirement to provide medication. She described medication treatment using drugs like buprenorphine to wean patients off stronger opioids as the gold standard for treating addiction.\r\nIts a rare issue on which Republicans arent at odds with the public health establishment.\r\nA repeal of the funding ban wouldnt mean a return to the 1965 mental health care model because that is just not where the system is today, thats not where the clinical understanding is today and thats not where any of the conversation is today, said Jack Rollins, the director of federal policy at the National Association of Medicaid Directors.\r\nForced care and the slippery slope\r\nBut theres still a powerful perception among many in the public that mental hospitals are akin to prisons and that opening the door to voluntary care will lead to forced treatment.\r\nWhen some people think of mental hospitals, they see the one in One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, the 1962 novel by Ken Kesey, or its 1975 film adaptation in which Jack Nicholson played a patient who was saner than the nurse caring for him.\r\nA faulty assumption is that [mental health institutions] are like therapeutic settings. We know theres a history in this country of institutions not being particularly therapeutic places, Bazelon Center for Mental Health Laws Bossing said.\r\nHe pointed to reports in recent years from Washingtons disability rights watchdog alleging abuse and neglect at \r\none public and \r\none private mental health hospital in the capital. Representatives of the institutions said they were investigating the accusations and would make changes if necessary.\r\nIn 2021, \r\nVirginia announced and quickly reversed a decision to close five of the states eight psychiatric hospitals to new admissions due to overcrowding and understaffing.\r\nAnd reinstitutionalization, albeit on a small scale, is happening.\r\nNew York has sent about 130 people per week, involuntarily, to hospitals for psychiatric evaluation since May as part of a plan by Mayor Eric Adams to treat people who are unable to meet their basic needs.\r\nOn the other side of the country, California Gov. Gavin Newsom \r\nhas included ways to compel people into care in his mental health system overhaul. In March, Californians will decide on a $6.4 billion bond proposal Newsom has pitched to build nearly 25,000 psychiatric and addiction beds.\r\nRepresentatives of community mental health organizations in California plan to oppose the changes.\r\nIn New York City, a group of civil rights lawyers filed a class-action suit against Adams directive and want more data on its implementation to see whether its disproportionately affecting people of color.\r\nOpponents of New York City Mayor Eric Adams' plan to involuntarily send mentally ill homeless people to psychiatric hospitals protest in front of City Hall in December 2022.\r\n|\r\nSpencer Platt/Getty Images\r\nWeighing the politics\r\nStill, Newsom and Adams are reacting to growing public and political pressure caused by a massive crisis of homelessness and drug addiction.\r\nDrug use spiked during the Covid pandemic, as evidenced by the record levels of fatal overdoses now more than 100,000 a year.\r\nHomelessness \r\nrose by 12 percent between 2022 and 2023 nationwide as rents surged and pandemic-era aid ended. More than 650,000 people were experiencing homelessness on a single night in January 2023, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\r\nCalifornia is home to the most unhoused people of any state some 181,000 people followed by New York, with some 103,000.\r\nPoliticians fear open-air drug markets and tent encampments in their cities could hurt them at election time.\r\nAnd theyre increasingly confident that caring for more of those suffering on the streets in mental hospitals wont become a similar political liability.\r\nIt doesnt have to become a warehouse, you know, One Flew Over a Cuckoos Nest. Absolutely not. Thats wrong, it should not happen, Cassidy said."": ""{'PERSON': ['Michael Burgess', 'Ritchie Torres', 'Frank Pallone', 'Bill Cassidy', 'John F.
